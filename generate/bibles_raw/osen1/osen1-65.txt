65:1:1:Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother to James, sends greetings to those who are called, loved by God the Father, and kept safe in Jesus Christ.
65:1:2:May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
65:1:3:Beloved friends, I felt compelled to write to you about our shared salvation. I urge you to stand firm in the faith that was once delivered to all the saints.
65:1:4:For some individuals have secretly slipped in among you—people who were long ago marked out for condemnation. They are ungodly, turning the grace of our God into a license for immorality and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65:1:5:Now I want to remind you, although you already know this, that the Lord saved his people out of Egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe.
65:1:6:And He has also held angels who didn't keep their original position or maintain their proper dwelling in eternal chains under gloomy darkness, awaiting the judgment of the great day.
65:1:7:Just as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities, indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires, they serve as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
65:1:8:Yet these dreamers likewise defile their bodies, reject authority, and slander glorious beings.
65:1:9:But even Michael the archangel, when disputing with the devil over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him; instead, he said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
65:1:10:These people, however, speak abusively about whatever they don't understand, and the things they do understand instinctively—like irrational animals—lead to their own destruction.
65:1:11:Woe to them! For they have followed the path of Cain, rushed headlong into Balaam's error for profit, and perished in Korah's rebellion.
65:1:12:These individuals are hidden reefs at your love feasts, eating with you without any sense of awe. They are shepherds who care only for themselves, waterless clouds blown along by the wind, fruitless trees in late autumn—twice dead and uprooted.
65:1:13:They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
65:1:14:Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His holy ones,
65:1:15:to execute judgment on all, and to convict every person of all the ungodly acts they have committed and all the harsh words that ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
65:1:16:These people are grumblers and complainers, living according to their own desires, boasting arrogantly and flattering others for their own advantage.
65:1:17:But you, beloved friends, remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
65:1:18:They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers, following their own ungodly desires.
65:1:19:These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.
65:1:20:But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
65:1:21:Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life.
65:1:22:Show mercy to those who doubt;
65:1:23:save others by snatching them from the fire; and to still others, show mercy tempered with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
65:1:24:Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of His glory with great joy,
65:1:25:to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority, before all time, now, and forevermore. Amen.
