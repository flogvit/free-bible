10:1:1:After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed in Ziklag for two days.
10:1:2:On the third day, a man arrived from Saul's camp with torn clothes and dirt on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to show respect.
10:1:3:David asked him, "Where have you come from?" The man replied, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."
10:1:4:"What happened? Tell me," David demanded. The man answered, "The people fled from the battle, and many of them have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
10:1:5:David asked the young man who brought the news, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
10:1:6:The young man replied, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul leaning on his spear, with the chariots and horsemen closing in on him."
10:1:7:When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I responded, 'Here I am.'
10:1:8:He asked me, 'Who are you?' I told him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
10:1:9:Saul then said, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me and yet my life still lingers.'
10:1:10:So I stood over him and killed him, knowing that he could not survive after falling. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet on his arm, and I brought them here to you, my lord."
10:1:11:David tore his clothes in grief, and all the men with him did the same.
10:1:12:They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, as well as for the people of the Lord and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
10:1:13:David asked the young man who brought him the news, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."
10:1:14:David said to him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?"
10:1:15:Then David summoned one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and the man died.
10:1:16:David explained, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the Lord's anointed.'"
10:1:17:David then composed a lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,
10:1:18:and ordered that it be taught to the people of Judah; it is called the Song of the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar:
10:1:19:"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
10:1:20:Do not tell it in Gath, do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
10:1:21:Mountains of Gilboa, may there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fields yielding offerings. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.
10:1:22:From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan's bow never turned back, and Saul's sword never returned empty.
10:1:23:Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful in life, were not separated even in death. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
10:1:24:Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and luxury, and adorned your garments with golden ornaments.
10:1:25:How the mighty have fallen in the midst of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
10:1:26:I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was more wonderful than the love of women.
10:1:27:How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
10:2:1:After this, David inquired of the Lord, asking, "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" The Lord answered, "Go up." David asked, "Where should I go?" And He replied, "To Hebron."
10:2:2:So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.
10:2:3:David also brought his men who were with him, each with their families, and they settled in the towns around Hebron.
10:2:4:The people of Judah came to Hebron, and they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah. They informed David that the people of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul.
10:2:5:David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead, saying, "May you be blessed by the Lord for showing kindness to your lord, Saul, by burying him.
10:2:6:Now may the Lord show you steadfast love and faithfulness. I too will repay your kindness because you have done this.
10:2:7:Be strong and courageous, for even though Saul is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me as their king."
10:2:8:Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, and made him king over Gilead, Ashuri, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel.
10:2:9:Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned for two years. However, the tribe of Judah followed David.
10:2:10:David was king in Hebron over the tribe of Judah for seven and a half years.
10:2:11:Abner, son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
10:2:12:Joab, son of Zeruiah, along with David's servants, also went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down on opposite sides of the pool.
10:2:13:Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some young men get up and fight before us." Joab agreed.
10:2:14:So twelve young men from Benjamin, representing Ish-bosheth, and twelve from David's servants stood up.
10:2:15:Each one grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they all fell dead together. So that place was named Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
10:2:16:That day the battle became very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's servants.
10:2:17:Three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as swift-footed as a wild gazelle.
10:2:18:He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left in his pursuit.
10:2:19:Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" He answered, "Yes, it is."
10:2:20:Abner said, "Turn aside to your right or left, seize one of the young men, and take his equipment." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
10:2:21:Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"
10:2:22:But Asahel refused to give up his pursuit. So Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and it came out his back. He fell dead on the spot, and everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen stopped.
10:2:23:Joab and Abishai continued to pursue Abner, and as the sun was setting, they arrived at the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
10:2:24:The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner, forming a single group. They took their stand on top of a hill.
10:2:25:Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize this will only end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?"
10:2:26:Joab answered, "As God lives, if you hadn't spoken up, the men would have continued pursuing their brothers until morning."
10:2:27:So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt. They stopped pursuing Israel and ceased fighting.
10:2:28:Abner and his men marched through the Arabah all that night, crossed the Jordan River, and went through the whole region of Bitron until they reached Mahanaim.
10:2:29:Joab returned from pursuing Abner and gathered all his troops. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's servants were missing.
10:2:30:But David's servants had killed 360 Benjamites who were with Abner.
10:2:31:They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
10:3:1:During the long war between Saul's house and David's house, David grew stronger, while Saul's house weakened.
10:3:2:David had sons born to him in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born to Ahinoam from Jezreel;
10:3:3:his second son, Chileab, was born to Abigail, widow of Nabal from Carmel; his third, Absalom, son of Maacah, daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
10:3:4:his fourth, Adonijah, son of Haggith; his fifth, Shephatiah, son of Abital;
10:3:5:and his sixth, Ithream, born to Eglah, David's wife. These sons were born to David in Hebron.
10:3:6:As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David continued, Abner became more influential in Saul's house.
10:3:7:Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, confronted Abner, asking, "Why have you slept with my father's concubine?"
10:3:8:Abner was furious at Ish-bosheth's accusation and said, "Am I just a dog's head from Judah? I've shown loyalty to your father's house, to his brothers, and to his friends, and haven't handed you over to David. Yet today you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!
10:3:9:May God punish me severely if I don't fulfill what the Lord has sworn to David:
10:3:10:to transfer the kingdom from Saul's house and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."
10:3:11:Ish-bosheth couldn't say anything in response to Abner because he was afraid of him.
10:3:12:Abner sent messengers to David, saying, "Who will rule the land? Make an agreement with me, and I'll help you unite all Israel under your control."
10:3:13:David replied, "Good, I'll make an agreement with you. But there's one condition: you can't come into my presence unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal when you visit."
10:3:14:David then sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, demanding, "Give me back my wife Michal, whom I married for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."
10:3:15:Ish-bosheth ordered that Michal be taken from her husband Paltiel, son of Laish.
10:3:16:Paltiel followed Michal, weeping, as far as Bahurim. But Abner told him, "Go back!" So he returned home.
10:3:17:Abner met with the elders of Israel, saying, "You've longed for David to be your king.
10:3:18:Now is the time! The Lord has said of David, 'Through my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and all their enemies.'"
10:3:19:Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin and went to Hebron to tell David everything that pleased Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
10:3:20:When Abner arrived at Hebron with twenty men, David prepared a feast for them.
10:3:21:Abner said to David, "Let me go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so they can make an agreement with you. Then you will rule over everything your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he left in peace.
10:3:22:Soon after, Joab and David's men returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
10:3:23:When Joab and all his troops arrived, he was informed that Abner, son of Ner, had come to the king and had been sent away in peace.
10:3:24:Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner came to you! Why did you let him go? Now he's gone!
10:3:25:You know Abner, son of Ner! He came to deceive you, to learn about your movements and everything you're doing!"
10:3:26:After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to bring Abner back from the well of Sirah, without David's knowledge.
10:3:27:When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway, as if to speak privately with him. There, he stabbed Abner in the stomach, and he died for shedding the blood of Joab's brother Asahel.
10:3:28:Later, when David heard about it, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord concerning the blood of Abner, son of Ner.
10:3:29:May the guilt fall on Joab and his family! May there never be a time when Joab's family is without someone suffering from a discharge, leprosy, or using a crutch, falling by the sword, or lacking food."
10:3:30:Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
10:3:31:David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn for Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.
10:3:32:They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people also wept.
10:3:33:The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died like a fool?
10:3:34:Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before the wicked." And all the people wept over him again.
10:3:35:Then they came and urged David to eat something while it was still day, but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"
10:3:36:All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.
10:3:37:That day all Israel knew that it had not been the king's decision to kill Abner, son of Ner.
10:3:38:The king said to his men, "Don't you realize that a great commander and a man of honor has fallen in Israel today?
10:3:39:And though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"
10:4:1:In the meantime, Saul's son Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron. As a result, his courage failed him, and all of Israel became uneasy.
10:4:2:Now, Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, had two officers who were leaders of raiding parties; one was named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, from the tribe of Benjamin (Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin).
10:4:3:The Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been living there as foreigners until this day.
10:4:4:Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.
10:4:5:Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at Ish-bosheth's house around noon while he was taking his midday rest.
10:4:6:They entered the house under the pretense of fetching wheat and struck him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.
10:4:7:When they entered the house, Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They killed him, beheaded him, and took his head with them. They traveled by the Arabah road all night.
10:4:8:They brought Ish-bosheth's head to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who sought your life. The Lord has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and his offspring."
10:4:9:But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered me from every trouble,
10:4:10:I will hold you responsible for your own death because you thought that by bringing me the news of Ish-bosheth's murder, you would receive a reward. Instead, I seized the man who brought me news of Saul's death, thinking he was a bearer of good news, and killed him in Ziklag.
10:4:11:How much more should I reward wicked men who have murdered an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed? I will surely demand your blood for this crime and rid the earth of you!"
10:4:12:Then David commanded his young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.
10:5:1:David became king over Israel when all the tribes of Israel came to him, saying, "We are your own flesh and blood.
10:5:2:In the past, while Saul was our king, you were the one who led Israel in battle. The Lord said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"
10:5:3:So all the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron, and he made a covenant with them there before the Lord. They anointed David as king over Israel.
10:5:4:David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for forty years.
10:5:5:He reigned in Hebron over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.
10:5:6:Then the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They told David, "You will not come in here; even the blind and the lame will keep you out." They thought, "David cannot enter here."
10:5:7:But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.
10:5:8:On that day, David said, "Whoever wants to strike down the Jebusites should attack them through the water shaft." So David's enemies became known as "the blind and the lame," whom he despised.
10:5:9:David settled in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces inward.
10:5:10:And David became more and more powerful because the Lord God of Hosts was with him.
10:5:11:Hiram, king of Tyre, sent envoys to David with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace for David.
10:5:12:David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
10:5:13:After moving from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and they bore him more sons and daughters.
10:5:14:These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
10:5:15:Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
10:5:16:Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
10:6:1:David gathered all his chosen men, numbering 30,000, from Israel.
10:6:2:He and the people with him set out to bring the Ark of God, which bears the Name, the LORD Almighty who is enthroned above the cherubim.
10:6:3:They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab's house, which was on a hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, guided the cart.
10:6:4:Uzzah walked beside the Ark of God, while Ahio went in front of it.
10:6:5:As they moved the Ark of God, David and the whole house of Israel celebrated with all their might, playing songs on various musical instruments, including harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
10:6:6:When they reached the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out to steady the Ark of God.
10:6:7:The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the Ark. Uzzah died there beside the Ark of God.
10:6:8:David was upset because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah, and that place was called Perez-Uzzah to this day.
10:6:9:Fearful of the LORD that day, David asked, "How can the Ark of the LORD ever come to me?"
10:6:10:So David decided not to move the Ark of the LORD into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
10:6:11:The Ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household.
10:6:12:When King David heard that the LORD had blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he owned because of the Ark of God, he went to bring the Ark of God from Obed-Edom's house to the City of David with rejoicing.
10:6:13:After those who carried the Ark of the LORD had gone six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
10:6:14:David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might.
10:6:15:As David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets.
10:6:16:As the Ark of the LORD entered the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. Seeing King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart.
10:6:17:They brought the Ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. David offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD.
10:6:18:After completing the offerings, David blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty.
10:6:19:He distributed to every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people returned home.
10:6:20:When David returned to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him. She said, "How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!"
10:6:21:David replied to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me over your father and his whole family to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD.
10:6:22:And I will humble myself even more and be lowly in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor."
10:6:23:Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
10:7:1:After the king had settled into his palace and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
10:7:2:Nathan, the prophet, came to him and said, "You live in a house of cedar, but the ark of God remains in a tent."
10:7:3:That night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
10:7:4:"Go tell my servant David, 'This is what the Lord says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
10:7:5:I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt. Instead, I have been moving about in a tent as my dwelling.
10:7:6:Throughout my time with the Israelites, did I ever ask any of their leaders, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, why they had not built me a house of cedar?'
10:7:7:"Now then, tell my servant David that this is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and made you ruler over my people Israel.
10:7:8:I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth.
10:7:9:And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
10:7:10:and have done since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. The Lord declares to you that he will establish a dynasty for you.
10:7:11:When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.
10:7:12:He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
10:7:13:I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands.
10:7:14:But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
10:7:15:Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'"
10:7:16:Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
10:7:17:Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and he said, "Who am I, Sovereign Lord, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
10:7:18:And as if this were not enough in your sight, Sovereign Lord, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant—and this decree, Sovereign Lord, is for a mere human!
10:7:19:What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Sovereign Lord.
10:7:20:For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.
10:7:21:You are great, O Lord God. There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
10:7:22:And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
10:7:23:You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, Lord, have become their God.
10:7:24:And now, Lord God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,
10:7:25:so that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, 'The Lord Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established in your presence.
10:7:26:Lord Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, 'I will build a house for you.' So your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
10:7:27:Sovereign Lord, you are God! Your covenant is trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.
10:7:28:Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your presence; for you, Sovereign Lord, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever."
10:8:1:In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, taking control of their territory from their hands.
10:8:2:He also triumphed over Moab, making them lie down on the ground and measuring them with a cord. He measured two lengths to put to death and one length to keep alive. The Moabites became subject to David and paid tribute.
10:8:3:David then struck down Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his dominion at the Euphrates River.
10:8:4:David captured 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
10:8:5:When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them.
10:8:6:David established garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and paid tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
10:8:7:David took the gold shields that belonged to the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
10:8:8:From Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze.
10:8:9:When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
10:8:10:he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David and to bless him for defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze.
10:8:11:King David dedicated these articles, along with the silver and gold he had taken from all the nations he had subdued, to the Lord.
10:8:12:These nations included Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
10:8:13:David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
10:8:14:He established garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom, he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
10:8:15:David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people.
10:8:16:Joab, son of Zeruiah, was over the army; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder;
10:8:17:Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, were priests; Seraiah was the secretary;
10:8:18:Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief officials at the king's side.
10:9:1:One day, David asked, "Is there anyone left from Saul's family that I can show kindness to for Jonathan's sake?"
10:9:2:Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba. They summoned him to appear before David, and the king asked him, "Are you Ziba?" He replied, "Yes, I am your servant."
10:9:3:The king inquired, "Is there anyone remaining from Saul's family to whom I can extend God's kindness?" Ziba answered, "There is still a son of Jonathan, but he is crippled in both feet."
10:9:4:"Where is he?" David asked. Ziba told him, "He is at the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar."
10:9:5:So King David sent for him and brought him from Machir's house.
10:9:6:When Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, "Mephibosheth!" He responded, "I am your servant."
10:9:7:"Don't be afraid," David reassured him, "I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table."
10:9:8:Mephibosheth bowed down again and said, "What is your servant, that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?"
10:9:9:Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's servant, and told him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family."
10:9:10:"You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the harvest, so that your master's grandson may be provided for. Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table." (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
10:9:11:Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do everything my lord the king commands." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the king's sons.
10:9:12:Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all the members of Ziba's household were servants of Mephibosheth.
10:9:13:And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table; he was lame in both feet.
10:10:1:Around the time when King David sent his officials to console Hanun, Nahash's son and the Ammonite king, on his father's death.
10:10:2:David said, "I want to show kindness to Hanun, just as his father showed kindness to me." So he sent his officials to express condolences for his father's death. However, when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
10:10:3:the Ammonite leaders warned Hanun, "Do you really think that David is honoring your father by sending these men to comfort you? Isn't it more likely that they're here to spy on our city and overthrow it?"
10:10:4:In response, Hanun seized David's officials, shaved off half their beards, cut their garments at the hips, and sent them away humiliated.
10:10:5:When David heard about this, he sent messengers to meet the officials, since they were too ashamed to return. He told them, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, then come home."
10:10:6:Realizing they had angered David, the Ammonites hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zobah, along with a thousand soldiers from the king of Maacah and 12,000 men from Tob.
10:10:7:When David learned of this, he sent Joab and the entire army, including his best warriors.
10:10:8:The Ammonites marched out and prepared for battle near the entrance to their city, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob, along with the men from Tob and Maacah, positioned themselves in the open field.
10:10:9:Seeing that the enemy forces were both in front and behind him, Joab divided his troops. He put the best fighters under his command to face the Arameans,
10:10:10:and assigned the rest of the soldiers to his brother Abishai, so they could confront the Ammonites.
10:10:11:Joab said, "If the Arameans become too strong for me, you must come and help me. But if the Ammonites become too strong for you, I will help you.
10:10:12:Let's be courageous and fight hard for our people and the cities of our God. May the Lord's will be done."
10:10:13:Joab and his men advanced against the Arameans, who fled before them.
10:10:14:When the Ammonites saw the Arameans fleeing, they also retreated from Abishai and went back into their city. So Joab withdrew from fighting the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.
10:10:15:Seeing that they had been defeated by Israel, the Arameans regrouped.
10:10:16:Hadadezer sent for more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam, led by Shobach, commander of Hadadezer's army.
10:10:17:When David heard about this, he gathered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and met the Arameans in battle at Helam. The Arameans lined up against David and began to fight.
10:10:18:But the Arameans were once again defeated by Israel, with David's forces killing 700 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. They also struck down Shobach, the commander of the army, who died there.
10:10:19:When Hadadezer's allies realized they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. And the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
10:11:1:In the spring, when kings typically go to war, David sent Joab and his servants with him, along with Israel's army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
10:11:2:One evening, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From there, he saw a woman bathing, and she was very beautiful.
10:11:3:David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10:11:4:Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself after her period.) Then she went back home.
10:11:5:The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant."
10:11:6:So David sent a message to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David.
10:11:7:When Uriah arrived, David asked how Joab and the soldiers were doing and how the war was going.
10:11:8:Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
10:11:9:But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.
10:11:10:David was told, "Uriah did not go home." So he asked Uriah, "Haven't you just come from a journey? Why didn't you go home?"
10:11:11:Uriah replied, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!"
10:11:12:Then David said to him, "Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
10:11:13:At David's invitation, Uriah ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.
10:11:14:In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
10:11:15:In the letter he wrote, "Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die."
10:11:16:So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.
10:11:17:When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.
10:11:18:Joab sent David a full account of the battle.
10:11:19:He instructed the messenger, "When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle,
10:11:20:the king's anger may flare up, and he may ask you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?
10:11:21:Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn't a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' If he asks you this, then say to him, 'Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'"
10:11:22:The messenger set out, and when he arrived, he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.
10:11:23:The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate.
10:11:24:Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's men died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead."
10:11:25:David told the messenger, "Say this to Joab: 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Say this to encourage Joab."
10:11:26:When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
10:11:27:After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done displeased the Lord.
10:12:1:Nathan the prophet came to David after the Lord sent him. He told David a story, saying, "There were two men in one city; one was rich and the other poor.
10:12:2:The rich man had many flocks and herds,
10:12:3:but the poor man had nothing except for one little ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup, and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
10:12:4:Now a traveler came to the rich man, but instead of taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for his guest, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the traveler."
10:12:5:David became very angry at the rich man and said to Nathan, "As the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
10:12:6:He must pay back four times the value of the lamb because he did such a terrible thing and showed no compassion."
10:12:7:Nathan replied to David, "You are that man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
10:12:8:I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I would have given you even more.
10:12:9:Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in His eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
10:12:10:Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'
10:12:11:This is what the Lord says: 'I am going to bring disaster on you from your own family. I will take your wives and give them to someone else before your very eyes, and he will sleep with them in broad daylight.
10:12:12:You did this in secret, but I will do this thing in front of all Israel, and in broad daylight.'"
10:12:13:David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord." Nathan replied, "The Lord has taken away your sin. You will not die.
10:12:14:However, because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for the Lord, the child born to you will surely die."
10:12:15:After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and it became very ill.
10:12:16:David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground.
10:12:17:The elders of his household stood beside him to help him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.
10:12:18:On the seventh day, the child died. David's attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate."
10:12:19:When David saw his attendants whispering, he realized the child was dead. He asked them, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "Yes, he is dead."
10:12:20:Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions, and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request, they served him food, and he ate.
10:12:21:His attendants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"
10:12:22:David answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.'
10:12:23:But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."
10:12:24:Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him
10:12:25:and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah, because of the Lord's affection.
10:12:26:Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.
10:12:27:Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.
10:12:28:Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me."
10:12:29:So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it.
10:12:30:He took the crown from their king's head, and it was placed on David's head. It weighed a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city
10:12:31:and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. He did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
10:13:1:In the course of time, David's son Amnon fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom, another of David's sons.
10:13:2:Amnon was so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he became sick. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
10:13:3:Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
10:13:4:He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so sad every morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon replied, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
10:13:5:Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"
10:13:6:So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make some special bread in my presence, so I may eat from her hand."
10:13:7:David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare some food for him."
10:13:8:So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his presence, and baked it.
10:13:9:Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him.
10:13:10:Amnon then said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the bedroom so I may eat from your hand." Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in the bedroom.
10:13:11:But when she offered it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister."
10:13:12:"No, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me; such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing.
10:13:13:Where could I go in my shame? And you would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you."
10:13:14:But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.
10:13:15:Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"
10:13:16:"No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he would not listen to her.
10:13:17:He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her."
10:13:18:So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.
10:13:19:Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.
10:13:20:Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman.
10:13:21:When King David heard all this, he was furious.
10:13:22:And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.
10:13:23:Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there.
10:13:24:Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?"
10:13:25:"No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave his blessing.
10:13:26:Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"
10:13:27:But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons.
10:13:28:Absalom ordered his men, "Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Haven't I given you this order? Be strong and brave."
10:13:29:So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.
10:13:30:While they were on their way, the report came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."
10:13:31:The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn.
10:13:32:But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
10:13:33:My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead."
10:13:34:Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, "I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill."
10:13:35:Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said."
10:13:36:As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king too and all his attendants wept very bitterly.
10:13:37:Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son.
10:13:38:After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.
10:13:39:And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.
10:14:1:Joab, aware that the king's heart longed for Absalom,
10:14:2:sent for a wise woman from Tekoa. He told her, "Pretend to be in mourning; wear mourning clothes and don't use any cosmetics. Act like a woman who has been grieving for the dead for a long time.
10:14:3:Then go to the king and speak these words to him." Joab provided her with the exact words she should say.
10:14:4:When the woman from Tekoa came to the king, she fell facedown in front of him in respect and said, "Help me, O king!"
10:14:5:The king asked her, "What troubles you?" She replied, "I am a widow; my husband is dead.
10:14:6:Your servant had two sons, and they got into a fight in the field with no one to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.
10:14:7:Now the whole family has turned against your servant. They demand, 'Hand over the one who killed his brother so we can execute him for taking his brother's life.' They want to destroy the heir as well. This would extinguish the only remaining ember of my husband's name, leaving his inheritance without a trace."
10:14:8:The king told the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order on your behalf."
10:14:9:But the woman from Tekoa said to the king, "My lord, may any blame fall on me and my father's house, and may the king and his throne be innocent."
10:14:10:The king replied, "If anyone says anything against you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again."
10:14:11:She said, "Please, may the king swear by the LORD your God that the avenger of blood will not increase my loss, so they won't destroy my son." He promised, "As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."
10:14:12:Then the woman said, "May I say one more thing to my lord the king?" He replied, "Go ahead."
10:14:13:The woman said, "Why have you devised something like this against God's people? When the king says this, doesn't he convict himself? For the king has not brought back his own banished son.
10:14:14:We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways for the banished person not to remain estranged from him.
10:14:15:Now, I have come to speak with my lord the king about this matter because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant's request.
10:14:16:Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who seeks to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave us.'
10:14:17:And now, may your servant find favor in your eyes, and may you show kindness to me by granting my request and saving my son's life."
10:14:18:The king answered the woman, "Don't withhold anything from me. I'm going to ask you a question, and you must tell me the truth." The woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."
10:14:19:The king asked, "Is Joab involved in this?" The woman replied, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, there is no turning to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. Your servant Joab instructed me and put all these words into my mouth.
10:14:20:Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God, knowing everything that happens in the land."
10:14:21:The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will grant your request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."
10:14:22:Joab fell facedown on the ground in respect and blessed the king. He said, "Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request."
10:14:23:Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
10:14:24:However, the king said, "Absalom must return to his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king's face.
10:14:25:In all Israel, there was no one as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him.
10:14:26:Whenever he cut his hair (he did so once a year because it became too heavy), it weighed about five pounds according to the royal standard.
10:14:27:Absalom had three sons and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman.
10:14:28:Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king's face.
10:14:29:Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but he still wouldn't come.
10:14:30:So Absalom said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
10:14:31:Then Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, "Why did your servants set my field on fire?"
10:14:32:Absalom answered, "I sent for you, asking you to come here so I could send you to the king with this message: 'Why have I come back from Geshur? It would have been better for me if I were still there!' Now let me see the king's face; if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death."
10:14:33:So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, who came to him and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
10:15:1:After a while, Absalom got himself a chariot, horses, and fifty men to run ahead of him.
10:15:2:Absalom would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever someone came with a complaint to be heard by the king, Absalom would call out to them and ask, "What city are you from?" They would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
10:15:3:Then Absalom would say, "Look, your claims are valid and just, but there's no one appointed by the king to hear your case."
10:15:4:Absalom would also say, "If only I were made judge in the land! Then anyone with a dispute or a legal matter could come to me, and I would make sure they received justice."
10:15:5:Whenever someone approached Absalom to bow down before him, he would reach out, take hold of them, and kiss them.
10:15:6:Absalom treated everyone like this who came to the king for judgment, and in doing so, he won the hearts of the people of Israel.
10:15:7:Four years later, Absalom said to his father, "Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I made to the Lord.
10:15:8:For when I was living in Geshur in Aram, I made a promise that if the Lord brought me back to Jerusalem, I would worship Him in Hebron."
10:15:9:King David agreed and said, "Go in peace." So Absalom went to Hebron.
10:15:10:But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, announce, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'"
10:15:11:With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited as guests; they went innocently, knowing nothing about the conspiracy.
10:15:12:While offering sacrifices, Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from his hometown of Giloh. The conspiracy grew strong, and more people supported Absalom every day.
10:15:13:A messenger came to David and said, "The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom."
10:15:14:David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "We must leave immediately! Otherwise, we won't escape from Absalom. Hurry, or he will soon overtake us and bring disaster on us and put the city to the sword."
10:15:15:The king's officials answered, "Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses."
10:15:16:The king set out with his entire household, leaving behind ten concubines to take care of the palace.
10:15:17:As the king and all the people left, they paused at the last house.
10:15:18:All his men marched past him, along with the Kerethites, Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath.
10:15:19:The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom, since you are a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.
10:15:20:You arrived only yesterday, so should I make you wander around with us today when I don't know where we're going? Go back, and take your fellow countrymen with you. May the Lord show you kindness and faithfulness."
10:15:21:But Ittai replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be."
10:15:22:David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and their families.
10:15:23:Everyone in the city was weeping as they watched the king and his followers cross the Kidron Valley and head toward the wilderness.
10:15:24:Zadok and all the Levites were with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.
10:15:25:The king told Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see both it and the place where it stays.
10:15:26:But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
10:15:27:The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, and take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan with you.
10:15:28:I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
10:15:29:So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
10:15:30:As David went up the Mount of Olives, he wept and covered his head. He was barefoot, and all the people with him covered their heads and wept as they went up.
10:15:31:David received word that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. So he prayed, "Lord, please turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."
10:15:32:When David reached the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite came to meet him, with his robe torn and dust on his head.
10:15:33:David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.
10:15:34:But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in the past, so now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice.
10:15:35:Won't Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace.
10:15:36:Their two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear."
10:15:37:So Hushai, David's confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
10:16:1:When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, met him with a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a wineskin full of wine.
10:16:2:"What is the purpose of these things?" David asked Ziba. Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who become weary in the wilderness."
10:16:3:Then the king asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba answered the king, "He is staying in Jerusalem because he believes that the people of Israel will restore to him the kingdom of his grandfather."
10:16:4:David said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." Ziba responded, "I humbly bow before you; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king."
10:16:5:As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out cursing continuously. His name was Shimei son of Gera.
10:16:6:He threw stones at David and all of King David's officials, though the entire army and all the mighty warriors were on David's right and left.
10:16:7:As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, you worthless scoundrel!
10:16:8:The LORD has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. See, your own evil has overtaken you, for you are a man of bloodshed!"
10:16:9:Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and remove his head."
10:16:10:But the king replied, "What does this have to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD told him to curse David, who can ask, 'Why are you doing this?'"
10:16:11:David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My own son, who came from my own body, is trying to take my life. How much more now may this Benjamite do it? Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
10:16:12:Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today."
10:16:13:So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei went along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went, throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.
10:16:14:The king and all the people with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where he refreshed himself.
10:16:15:Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
10:16:16:When Hushai the Arkite, David's confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
10:16:17:Absalom asked Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?"
10:16:18:Hushai replied, "No, the one chosen by the LORD, by these people, and by all the men of Israel – I will be with him.
10:16:19:Furthermore, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served your father, so will I serve you."
10:16:20:Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"
10:16:21:Ahithophel answered, "Sleep with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened."
10:16:22:So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
10:16:23:Now in those days, the advice Ahithophel gave was like someone asking for the word of God; such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel's advice.
10:17:1:Hushai, David's friend, told Ahithophel's advice to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. He said, "Ahithophel has given this advice against David."
10:17:2:Then Hushai continued, "Now, quickly send a message to David, warning him not to spend the night at the wilderness' crossing of the Jordan River. Instead, he must cross over immediately, or he and all his people will be swallowed up."
10:17:3:Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En Rogel, as they didn't want to be seen entering Jerusalem. A servant girl would go and inform them, and they would then relay the message to King David.
10:17:4:But a young man saw them and reported it to Absalom. So they both quickly departed and went to a man's house in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. They climbed down into it.
10:17:5:The man's wife took a covering and spread it over the well's opening, scattering grain on top so that nothing was noticed.
10:17:6:When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman replied, "They have crossed the brook." The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.
10:17:7:After the men left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They told him to cross the Jordan River immediately, as Ahithophel had advised Absalom to attack him.
10:17:8:David and all his people crossed the Jordan, and by daybreak, everyone had made it across.
10:17:9:When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his hometown. He put his affairs in order and then hanged himself. He was buried in his father's tomb.
10:17:10:Meanwhile, David arrived at Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan River with all the men of Israel.
10:17:11:Absalom had appointed Amasa as commander of his army, replacing Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, an Ishmaelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
10:17:12:Israel and Absalom set up camp in the land of Gilead.
10:17:13:When David arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
10:17:14:brought bedding, bowls, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
10:17:15:honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from cow's milk for David and his people to eat. They said, "The people have become exhausted, hungry, and thirsty in the wilderness."
10:18:1:In those days, David organized his forces to fight against Absalom. He appointed commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds.
10:18:2:David divided the troops into three groups, one under Joab's command, one under Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai the Gittite. The king said to his men, "I will also go out with you."
10:18:3:But the soldiers objected, saying, "You should not go out. If we flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care. But you are worth ten thousand of us. So it is better that you stay in the city and support us from there."
10:18:4:The king replied, "I will do what seems best to you." So he stood by the gate while all the troops marched out in units of hundreds and thousands.
10:18:5:David instructed Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." All the troops heard the king's order concerning Absalom.
10:18:6:So the army went into battle against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
10:18:7:There, the people of Israel were defeated by David's men, and the casualties were great that day—twenty thousand men.
10:18:8:The battle spread across the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.
10:18:9:During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David's men. As he rode his mule, it went under a large oak tree, and Absalom's hair got caught in the branches. He was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule he was riding continued on.
10:18:10:A man saw this and informed Joab, saying, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."
10:18:11:Joab asked the man who reported it, "You saw him? Why didn't you strike him down right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a warrior's belt!"
10:18:12:The man replied, "Even if you gave me a thousand shekels of silver, I wouldn't lift my hand against the king's son. We all heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'
10:18:13:And if I had put my life in jeopardy—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have stood aloof."
10:18:14:Joab said, "I'm not going to waste time with you." So he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak tree.
10:18:15:Ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.
10:18:16:Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.
10:18:17:They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled up a huge heap of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.
10:18:18:During his lifetime, Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.
10:18:19:Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies."
10:18:20:But Joab told him, "You are not the one to carry the news today. You may do it another time, but you must not do it today, because the king's son is dead."
10:18:21:Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed before Joab and ran off.
10:18:22:Ahimaaz insisted, "Come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite." Joab replied, "Why do you want to run, my son? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward."
10:18:23:He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab allowed him to run. Ahimaaz took the plain route and outran the Cushite.
10:18:24:David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.
10:18:25:The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, "If he is alone, he must have good news." And the runner came closer and closer.
10:18:26:Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He too must be bringing good news."
10:18:27:The watchman said, "I think the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok." The king said, "He's a good man and comes with good news."
10:18:28:Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king."
10:18:29:The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was."
10:18:30:The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there.
10:18:31:Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you."
10:18:32:The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man."
10:18:33:The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10:19:1:Joab was informed, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."
10:19:2:And so the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, because they heard that the king was grieving for his son.
10:19:3:The people stole away that day, ashamed as though they were fleeing from battle.
10:19:4:The king covered his face and cried out loudly, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10:19:5:Then Joab went to the king's house and said, "Today you have humiliated all your servants, who today have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines,
10:19:6:by showing love to those who hate you and hate to those who love you. You have made it clear today that your commanders and servants mean nothing to you. I see that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, it would be more pleasing to you.
10:19:7:Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, not a single man will stay with you this night; and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now."
10:19:8:So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, saying, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate," all the people came before the king. Meanwhile, Israel had fled, each to his tent.
10:19:9:All the people were quarreling throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
10:19:10:However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
10:19:11:King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah, asking, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his residence?
10:19:12:You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?'
10:19:13:And tell Amasa, 'Are you not my flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.'"
10:19:14:He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your servants."
10:19:15:So the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. The people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and escort him across the Jordan.
10:19:16:Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
10:19:17:With him were a thousand Benjaminites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan before the king
10:19:18:and crossed at the ford to take the king's household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king
10:19:19:and said to him, "May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.
10:19:20:For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king."
10:19:21:But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD's anointed."
10:19:22:David replied, "What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don't I know that today I am king over Israel?"
10:19:23:So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king swore an oath to him.
10:19:24:Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
10:19:25:When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"
10:19:26:He said, "My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But my servant Ziba deceived me,
10:19:27:and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish.
10:19:28:All my grandfather's descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?"
10:19:29:The king said to him, "Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land."
10:19:30:Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has arrived home safely."
10:19:31:Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.
10:19:32:Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
10:19:33:The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you."
10:19:34:But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
10:19:35:I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
10:19:36:Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?
10:19:37:Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish."
10:19:38:The king said, "Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you."
10:19:39:So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home.
10:19:40:When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Chimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.
10:19:41:Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal you away and bring the king and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?"
10:19:42:All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king's provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?"
10:19:43:Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren't we the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah responded even more harshly than the men of Israel.
10:20:1:In the meantime, a troublemaker named Sheba, son of Bichri from the tribe of Benjamin, blew the trumpet and declared, "We have no share in David; we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to his tent, Israel!"
10:20:2:So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba, son of Bichri. But the men of Judah stayed loyal to their king, from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
10:20:3:When David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but did not sleep with them. They were kept in confinement until the day they died, living as widows.
10:20:4:The king then said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself."
10:20:5:Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time the king had set for him.
10:20:6:David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba, son of Bichri, will cause more harm to us than Absalom. Take your lord's servants and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us."
10:20:7:So Joab's men, the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:8:While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military attire with a belt around his waist that held a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward to greet Amasa, the dagger fell out.
10:20:9:Joab asked Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then he grabbed Amasa's beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10:20:10:Amasa didn't notice the dagger in Joab's left hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach, spilling his intestines on the ground. He did not strike him again, and Amasa died. Joab and his brother Abishai continued to pursue Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:11:One of Joab's men stood beside Amasa's body and said, "Whoever favors Joab and supports David should follow Joab!"
10:20:12:Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops were stopping to look. So he dragged Amasa from the road into a field and threw a cloak over him.
10:20:13:After he was removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba, son of Bichri.
10:20:14:Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him.
10:20:15:Joab's troops came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp against the outer wall of the city. All the troops with Joab were trying to bring the wall down.
10:20:16:A wise woman called out from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him."
10:20:17:When Joab approached the woman, she asked, "Are you Joab?" He replied, "I am." Then she said, "Listen to what your servant has to say." Joab answered, "I'm listening."
10:20:18:She continued, "In the past, people used to say, 'Seek advice at Abel,' and that's how disputes were settled.
10:20:19:I am one of the peaceful and faithful citizens of Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why would you want to swallow up the Lord's inheritance?"
10:20:20:Joab replied, "Far be it from me! I don't want to swallow up or destroy anything.
10:20:21:That's not the case. A man named Sheba, son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has raised his hand against King David. Hand him over, and I will withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you from the wall."
10:20:22:Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba, son of Bichri, and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and his troops dispersed from the city, each returning to their own home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
10:20:23:Joab was once again in command of the entire army of Israel. 
10:20:24:Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; 
10:20:25:Adoniram was in charge of forced labor; 
10:20:26:Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the royal historian;
10:20:27:Sheva was the royal secretary; 
10:20:28:Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
10:20:29:and Ira the Jairite was David's personal priest.
10:21:1:During David's reign, there was a severe famine that lasted for three years. David sought the Lord's guidance, and the Lord said, "It is because of Saul and his blood-stained house; he killed the Gibeonites."
10:21:2:So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (The Gibeonites were not Israelites but were survivors of the Amorites, whom the Israelites had sworn to protect, but Saul had tried to annihilate them in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.)
10:21:3:David asked the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you? How can I make amends so that you will bless the Lord's inheritance?"
10:21:4:The Gibeonites replied, "We don't want silver or gold from Saul's family, nor do we want anyone from Israel to be put to death." "Then what do you want me to do for you?" David asked.
10:21:5:They answered the king, "As for the man who tried to destroy us and plotted against us so that we would have no place in Israel's territory,
10:21:6:let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be executed and exposed before the Lord at Gibeah of Saul, the Lord's chosen one." The king agreed and said, "I will give them to you."
10:21:7:But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, because of the oath made between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul.
10:21:8:The king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
10:21:9:He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who executed and exposed them on a hill before the Lord. All seven of them died together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning.
10:21:10:Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night.
10:21:11:When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done,
10:21:12:he went and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them after striking down Saul on Gilboa.
10:21:13:David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and he gathered the bones of those who had been executed.
10:21:14:They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.
10:21:15:Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his soldiers, and they fought against the Philistines, but David became exhausted.
10:21:16:Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose bronze spear weighed about eight pounds and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David.
10:21:17:But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue; he struck down the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, "You must never go out with us to battle again, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished."
10:21:18:In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.
10:21:19:In still another battle at Gob with the Philistines, Jaare-oregim's son from Bethlehem killed Saph, another descendant of the giants.
10:21:20:And in yet another battle at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from the giants.
10:21:21:When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son
10:21:22:of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
10:21:23:These four were descendants of the giants in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his soldiers. 
10:22:1:David sang this song to the Lord when he was saved from all his enemies and from Saul.
10:22:2:He said, "The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my savior.
10:22:3:My God is my rock, in whom I find protection. He's my shield, my strong tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.
10:22:4:I call on the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.
10:22:5:The waves of death surrounded me; the floods of destruction overwhelmed me.
10:22:6:The cords of the grave wrapped around me; the traps of death confronted me.
10:22:7:In my distress, I called upon the Lord and cried out to my God. He heard my voice from his temple, and my cry reached his ears.
10:22:8:Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken because he was angry.
10:22:9:Smoke rose from his nostrils, and consuming fire came from his mouth; burning coals blazed forth from him.
10:22:10:He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds under his feet.
10:22:11:He rode upon a cherub and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
10:22:12:He made darkness his canopy around him, a gathering of water and thick clouds.
10:22:13:Out of the brightness before him, burning coals of fire blazed forth.
10:22:14:The Lord thundered from heaven; the Most High uttered his voice.
10:22:15:He shot arrows and scattered the enemies; he hurled lightning and routed them.
10:22:16:The depths of the sea were exposed, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
10:22:17:He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.
10:22:18:He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
10:22:19:They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support.
10:22:20:He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.
10:22:21:The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; he repaid me based on the cleanness of my hands.
10:22:22:For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
10:22:23:All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.
10:22:24:I am blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
10:22:25:The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, because of the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
10:22:26:To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
10:22:27:to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.
10:22:28:You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
10:22:29:Lord, you are my lamp; the Lord turns my darkness into light.
10:22:30:With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.
10:22:31:As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
10:22:32:For who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?
10:22:33:It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
10:22:34:He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.
10:22:35:He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
10:22:36:You give me your shield of victory; your help has made me great.
10:22:37:You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way.
10:22:38:I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back until they were destroyed.
10:22:39:I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
10:22:40:You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me.
10:22:41:You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed those who hated me.
10:22:42:They cried for help, but there was no one to save them; they called to the Lord, but he did not answer.
10:22:43:I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets.
10:22:44:You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me.
10:22:45:Foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
10:22:46:They lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.
10:22:47:The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!
10:22:48:He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,
10:22:49:who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; you rescued me from violent men.
10:22:50:Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name.
10:22:51:He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing love to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
10:23:1:These are the last words of David, the son of Jesse, the inspired leader of Israel's songs, the man anointed by the God of Jacob and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
10:23:2:The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; his word was on my tongue.
10:23:3:The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me: 'He who rules over people justly, ruling in the fear of God,
10:23:4:is like the morning light at sunrise on a cloudless day, shining brightly after rain brings out the beauty of the earth.'
10:23:5:Though my house is not perfect with God, he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered in every detail and secure. He will bring about all my salvation and my every desire.
10:23:6:But the wicked are like thorns that are thrown away, for they cannot be taken with the hand;
10:23:7:whoever touches them must use an iron tool or a spear shaft, and they are burned up completely on the spot."
10:23:8:These are the names of David's mighty warriors: Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
10:23:9:Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated,
10:23:10:but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.
10:23:11:Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them.
10:23:12:But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory.
10:23:13:During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
10:23:14:At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
10:23:15:David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
10:23:16:So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord.
10:23:17:"Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.
10:23:18:Abishai, the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
10:23:19:Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
10:23:20:Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab's two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
10:23:21:And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
10:23:22:Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors.
10:23:23:He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
10:23:24:Among the Thirty were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
10:23:25:Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
10:23:26:Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
10:23:27:Abiezer from Anathoth, Sibbecai the Hushathite,
10:23:28:Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
10:23:29:Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,
10:23:30:Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash,
10:23:31:Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
10:23:32:Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
10:23:33:Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
10:23:34:Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
10:23:35:Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
10:23:36:Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
10:23:37:Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
10:23:38:Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite
10:23:39:and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
10:24:1:One day, the Lord became angry with Israel and incited David to take a census of the people. So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go count the people of Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report so I may know their number."
10:24:2:Joab replied, "May the Lord multiply His people a hundred times over! But why does my lord the king want to do this? Are they not all your servants? Why should this bring guilt upon Israel?"
10:24:3:Despite Joab's objection, the king insisted on the census. So Joab left and went throughout all Israel to count the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
10:24:4:Joab reported the numbers to David: there were 800,000 valiant men in Israel who could handle a sword, and 500,000 men in Judah.
10:24:5:After the census was completed, David felt guilty for what he had done. He prayed to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Please forgive me, Lord, and remove my guilt."
10:24:6:In the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, who was David's seer. The Lord said,
10:24:7:"Go tell David that I am offering him three choices. He must choose one of them as a punishment for his sin."
10:24:8:So Gad went to David and told him, "You must choose between three options: seven years of famine in your land, three months of fleeing from your enemies, or three days of severe plague throughout the country. Think it over and decide which option you prefer."
10:24:9:David responded, "This is a difficult decision, but I would rather fall into the hands of the Lord, for His mercy is great. Do not let me fall into human hands."
10:24:10:So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 people died.
10:24:11:As the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord had compassion on the city and said, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the Lord was then standing by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
10:24:12:When David saw the angel striking down the people, he said to the Lord, "I am the one who sinned and acted foolishly. These sheep have done nothing wrong. Punish me and my family instead."
10:24:13:Gad returned to David with another message from the Lord. He said, "Go build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10:24:14:David obeyed the Lord's command and went to the threshing floor.
10:24:15:Araunah looked up and saw the king and his officials approaching him. He bowed down before the king and asked, "Why has my lord the king come to see his servant?"
10:24:16:David replied, "I have come to buy your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the Lord. Then the plague will be stopped."
10:24:17:Araunah said to David, "Take it, my lord the king, and do whatever you wish. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and you can use the threshing sledges and ox yokes for wood."
10:24:18:But David insisted, "No, I must pay you the full price. I will not take what belongs to you and offer it to the Lord. I will not present burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
10:24:19:So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
10:24:20:He built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The Lord answered his prayer, and the plague was stopped.
