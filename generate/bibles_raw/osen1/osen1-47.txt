47:1:1:Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, along with all the saints throughout Achaia:
47:1:2:Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
47:1:3:Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
47:1:4:who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
47:1:5:For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so through Christ our comfort also overflows.
47:1:6:If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.
47:1:7:And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort.
47:1:8:We want you to know, brothers and sisters, about the hardships we faced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.
47:1:9:Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened so that we would not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
47:1:10:He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
47:1:11:as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
47:1:12:Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God's grace.
47:1:13:For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,
47:1:14:as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
47:1:15:Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.
47:1:16:I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
47:1:17:When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?
47:1:18:But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."
47:1:19:For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas and Timothy—was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."
47:1:20:For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.
47:1:21:Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
47:1:22:set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
47:1:23:I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
47:1:24:Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
47:2:1:Now, I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.
47:2:2:For if I cause you pain, who is there to cheer me up but the very ones I've pained?
47:2:3:I wrote that letter so that when I came, I wouldn't be saddened by those who should make me rejoice. For I was confident in all of you, knowing that my joy would be shared by all of you.
47:2:4:Out of great distress and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears—not to grieve you, but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
47:2:5:If someone has caused grief, it's not just me they've hurt, but all of you to some extent—not to overstate it.
47:2:6:The punishment inflicted by the majority is sufficient for that person.
47:2:7:Instead, you should now forgive and comfort him, so he won't be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
47:2:8:I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.
47:2:9:The reason I wrote you was to test you and see if you would stand the test, being obedient in everything.
47:2:10:When you forgive someone, I do as well. And if I have forgiven anything, it's for your sake in the presence of Christ,
47:2:11:so we don't allow Satan to take advantage of us, for we're not ignorant of his schemes.
47:2:12:When I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,
47:2:13:I couldn't find any peace of mind because I didn't find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
47:2:14:But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ and reveals the fragrance of His knowledge through us in every place.
47:2:15:For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
47:2:16:To the latter, we're an odor of death leading to death, and to the former, a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
47:2:17:Unlike many, we don't peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
47:3:1:Are we starting to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
47:3:2:You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
47:3:3:You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
47:3:4:Such confidence we have through Christ before God.
47:3:5:Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.
47:3:6:He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
47:3:7:Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,
47:3:8:will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
47:3:9:If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
47:3:10:For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
47:3:11:And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
47:3:12:Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
47:3:13:We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away.
47:3:14:But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.
47:3:15:Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
47:3:16:But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
47:3:17:Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
47:3:18:And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
47:4:1:That's why we don't lose heart in this ministry that God, in his mercy, has given us.
47:4:2:We've rejected secret and shameful actions; we don't use deception or tamper with God's message. Instead, by openly sharing the truth, we present ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.
47:4:3:If our gospel is veiled, it's veiled to those who are perishing.
47:4:4:The god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they can't see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
47:4:5:We don't preach about ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.
47:4:6:For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in the face of Christ.
47:4:7:But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
47:4:8:We're hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
47:4:9:persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.
47:4:10:We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
47:4:11:For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.
47:4:12:So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
47:4:13:Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed; therefore I have spoken," we also believe and therefore speak,
47:4:14:knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.
47:4:15:All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
47:4:16:Therefore we don't lose heart. Though outwardly we're wasting away, yet inwardly we're being renewed day by day.
47:4:17:For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
47:4:18:So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
47:5:1:For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal home in heaven, not built by human hands.
47:5:2:Indeed, in this body we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
47:5:3:so that when we are finally clothed, we will not be found naked.
47:5:4:While we live in this tent, we groan under the burden, because we don't want to be unclothed but rather to be clothed over, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
47:5:5:The one who has prepared us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
47:5:6:Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
47:5:7:For we live by faith, not by sight.
47:5:8:We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
47:5:9:So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.
47:5:10:For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
47:5:11:Since we understand the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others. But we are well known to God, and I hope we are also well known to your conscience.
47:5:12:We are not trying to commend ourselves again to you, but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
47:5:13:If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
47:5:14:For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
47:5:15:And he died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
47:5:16:So from now on, we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
47:5:17:Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!
47:5:18:All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
47:5:19:that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
47:5:20:We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: be reconciled to God.
47:5:21:God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
47:6:1:As we work together with God, we urge you not to receive His grace in vain.
47:6:2:For He says, "In the acceptable time, I have listened to you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you." Look, now is the acceptable time! Now is the day of salvation!
47:6:3:We avoid putting any stumbling block in anyone's path, so our ministry won't be discredited.
47:6:4:Instead, we demonstrate ourselves as true servants of God in every way: through great endurance, in troubles, hardships, and distresses;
47:6:5:in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights, and hunger;
47:6:6:by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love,
47:6:7:truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and the left;
47:6:8:through honor and dishonor, bad report and good report; seen as deceivers, yet genuine;
47:6:9:as unknown, but well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, but not put to death;
47:6:10:sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
47:6:11:We have spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open.
47:6:12:You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
47:6:13:Now, as a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open your hearts wide too.
47:6:14:Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
47:6:15:What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
47:6:16:What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, as God said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them; I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
47:6:17:Therefore, "Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you."
47:6:18:"I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters," says the Lord Almighty.
47:7:1:So, having these promises, dear friends, let's cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
47:7:2:Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, corrupted no one, taken advantage of no one.
47:7:3:I'm not saying this to condemn you; I've already said that you have a special place in our hearts, so we live and die together.
47:7:4:I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am filled with encouragement and overflowing with joy despite all our troubles.
47:7:5:For when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way—conflicts on the outside, fears within.
47:7:6:But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus.
47:7:7:Not only by his coming, but also by the comfort he received from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me, which made me even happier.
47:7:8:Though I caused you sorrow with my letter, I don't regret it. Although I did regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a short time—
47:7:9:Now I am glad, not because you were made sad, but because your sadness led to repentance. For you became sad as God intended, so you were not harmed in any way by us.
47:7:10:Godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
47:7:11:See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: earnestness, a desire to clear yourselves, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and a readiness to punish the wrong. In everything, you have demonstrated your innocence in this matter.
47:7:12:So even though I wrote to you, it wasn't for the sake of the one who did the wrong or the one who was wronged, but rather so that your devotion to us would be revealed in the sight of God.
47:7:13:As a result, we have been encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
47:7:14:For if I have boasted about you to him in any way, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well.
47:7:15:And his affection for you is even greater when he remembers the obedience of you all, how you welcomed him with fear and trembling.
47:7:16:I am glad that I can have complete confidence in you.
47:8:1:Now, friends, we want you to know about the grace that God has given to the churches of Macedonia.
47:8:2:In their severe trials and extreme poverty, they overflowed with joy and rich generosity.
47:8:3:They gave as much as they could, even beyond their means, entirely on their own accord.
47:8:4:With great urgency, they pleaded for the privilege of sharing in the support of God's people.
47:8:5:Not only did they give what we expected, but they also gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, following God's will.
47:8:6:As a result, we encouraged Titus, who had already started this work, to help you complete this act of kindness as well.
47:8:7:You excel in everything—in faith, speech, knowledge, genuine concern, and love for us—so make sure you excel in this gracious act of giving too.
47:8:8:I'm not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the eagerness of others.
47:8:9:For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: although He was rich, He became poor for your sake, so that through His poverty you might become rich.
47:8:10:Here's my advice on this matter: It is to your advantage to finish what you started a year ago, since you were the first to begin and wanted to do so.
47:8:11:Now, complete the task, so that your eagerness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
47:8:12:For if there is a willingness to give, it is acceptable based on what one has, not on what one does not have.
47:8:13:Our goal is not to burden others but to achieve fairness.
47:8:14:At the present time, your surplus will meet their need, so that in turn their surplus may meet your need, creating a sense of equality.
47:8:15:As it is written: "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little."
47:8:16:Thanks be to God, who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus.
47:8:17:For he not only welcomed our request but was also eager to help on his own initiative.
47:8:18:We are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the gospel.
47:8:19:Moreover, this brother was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry out this gracious act of service, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord and to show our eagerness to help.
47:8:20:We want to avoid any criticism of how we administer this generous gift.
47:8:21:For we are committed to doing what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of others.
47:8:22:In addition, we are sending another brother with them, someone who has often proved to us his zeal, and who is now even more eager because of his great confidence in you.
47:8:23:As for Titus, he is my partner and coworker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.
47:8:24:Therefore, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
47:9:1:Now concerning the service to the saints, it's unnecessary for me to write to you.
47:9:2:I know your eagerness, and I've been boasting about it to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared since last year. Your enthusiasm has inspired many others.
47:9:3:But I'm sending the brothers to ensure our boasting about you in this matter isn't in vain, so you'll be ready, as I said you would be.
47:9:4:Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.
47:9:5:So I thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to visit you ahead of time and finish arranging the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be a genuine gift, not one given reluctantly or under pressure.
47:9:6:Remember this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
47:9:7:Each person should give what they have decided in their heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
47:9:8:And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
47:9:9:As it is written: "They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever."
47:9:10:Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
47:9:11:You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
47:9:12:For this service that you perform not only meets the needs of the saints but also overflows in many expressions of thanks to God.
47:9:13:Because of the proof this service provides, others will praise God for your obedience to the gospel of Christ and for your generous sharing with them and with everyone else.
47:9:14:And in their prayers for you, their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
47:9:15:Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
47:10:1:Now I, Paul, appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ. Though I am humble when face-to-face with you, I am bold toward you when absent.
47:10:2:I ask that when I am present, I won't have to be as bold as I plan to be against some who think we live by worldly standards.
47:10:3:Indeed, we live in the world, but we don't wage war with worldly weapons.
47:10:4:Our weapons for battle are not of this world; they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
47:10:5:We tear down arguments and every arrogant idea that raises itself against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to obey Christ.
47:10:6:We are prepared to punish any disobedience once your obedience is complete.
47:10:7:Look at what's right in front of you. If someone is confident that they belong to Christ, let them consider again that we also belong to Christ.
47:10:8:Even if I boast somewhat about our authority, which the Lord gave us for building you up and not tearing you down, I won't be ashamed.
47:10:9:I don't want to seem like I'm trying to intimidate you with my letters.
47:10:10:For some say, "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing."
47:10:11:Let those people understand this: What we are in our letters when absent, we will be in our actions when present.
47:10:12:We wouldn't dare to classify or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they lack wisdom.
47:10:13:But we won't boast beyond our limits; instead, we will stay within the boundaries that God has set for us, reaching even to you.
47:10:14:We are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach you. We were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
47:10:15:We don't boast about what others have done in their territory, but we hope that as your faith grows, our influence among you will greatly expand.
47:10:16:So that we can preach the gospel in areas beyond you, without boasting about work already done in someone else's territory.
47:10:17:As the Scripture says, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
47:10:18:For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
47:11:1:You should be patient with me as I boast a little. Indeed, you already are.
47:11:2:I'm envious of you because of God's jealousy; for I have arranged your marriage to one husband, presenting you as a pure virgin to Christ.
47:11:3:However, I'm afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning, your minds may be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.
47:11:4:If someone comes and preaches another Jesus whom we haven't preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you haven't received, or a different gospel which you haven't accepted, you put up with it quite well.
47:11:5:In fact, I consider myself not at all inferior to those "super-apostles."
47:11:6:Even though I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; we've made this clear to you in every way possible.
47:11:7:Or did I do something wrong by humbling myself so you could be exalted, when I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?
47:11:8:I robbed other churches by taking support from them to serve you.
47:11:9:When I was with you and in need, I didn't burden anyone; the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs. I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do so.
47:11:10:As the truth of Christ is in me, I will not stop boasting about this throughout Achaia.
47:11:11:Why? Because I don't love you? God knows I do.
47:11:12:But what I'm doing, I will keep doing, to cut off any opportunity for those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things they boast about.
47:11:13:Such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
47:11:14:This is no surprise, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
47:11:15:So it's not a big deal if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their actions.
47:11:16:I repeat, let no one think I'm foolish; but if you do, accept me as a fool so that I too may boast a little.
47:11:17:What I am saying now, I don't say as the Lord would, but rather as a fool, in this confidence of boasting.
47:11:18:Since many boast according to the flesh, I will also boast.
47:11:19:You gladly tolerate fools, being wise yourselves.
47:11:20:You put up with it if someone enslaves you, exploits you, takes advantage of you, puts on airs, or slaps you in the face.
47:11:21:I say this to your shame. As if we were weak! But in whatever anyone else dares to boast—I'm speaking foolishly—I dare to boast as well.
47:11:22:Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
47:11:23:Are they servants of Christ? I'm speaking like a madman, but I am even more so: in far greater labors, in countless imprisonments, in beatings beyond measure, and often near death.
47:11:24:Five times I received forty lashes minus one from the Jews.
47:11:25:Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, and I spent a night and a day adrift at sea.
47:11:26:On frequent journeys, I faced dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, and dangers among false brothers.
47:11:27:I've labored and toiled, often without sleep; I've experienced hunger and thirst, frequently fasting; I've been cold and naked.
47:11:28:Besides all these external things, there's the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.
47:11:29:Who is weak, and I'm not weak? Who is led into sin, and I don't burn with indignation?
47:11:30:If I must boast, I will boast about the things that show my weakness.
47:11:31:The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows I am not lying.
47:11:32:In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes to arrest me,
47:11:33:but I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
47:12:1:In boasting, I must admit it's not beneficial, but I'll continue on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
47:12:2:I know a man in Christ who, fourteen years ago, was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of it, I don't know; only God knows.
47:12:3:And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from it, I cannot tell, but God knows—
47:12:4:was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which are not permitted for a human being to express.
47:12:5:I will boast about such a person, but I won't boast about myself, except regarding my weaknesses.
47:12:6:Even if I wanted to boast, I wouldn't be foolish, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may think more of me than what they see in me or hear from me.
47:12:7:To keep me from becoming conceited due to the surpassing greatness of these revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me—a messenger of Satan to torment me, so that I would not become too proud.
47:12:8:Three times I pleaded with the Lord to remove it from me.
47:12:9:But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness." So, I will gladly boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
47:12:10:For this reason, I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
47:12:11:I have become a fool in boasting, but you forced me to do so. You should have commended me, for I am not inferior to those "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
47:12:12:The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience—signs, wonders, and miracles.
47:12:13:In what way were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn't burden you financially? Forgive me for this wrong!
47:12:14:Look, I am ready to come to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don't want your possessions; I want you. Children shouldn't save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
47:12:15:I will gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, will you love me less?
47:12:16:Be that as it may, I wasn't a burden to you. But, being crafty, I caught you by deceit!
47:12:17:Did I take advantage of you through any of the people I sent to you?
47:12:18:I urged Titus to visit you and sent our brother along with him. Did Titus exploit you in any way? Didn't we walk in the same spirit and follow the same steps?
47:12:19:Have you been thinking that we've been defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
47:12:20:For I fear that when I come, I may find you not as I wish, and you may find me not as you wish. I fear there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.
47:12:21:I'm afraid that when I come again, my God may humiliate me before you, and I will grieve over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery in which they have indulged.
47:13:1:This is the third time I'm coming to visit you. Every matter will be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
47:13:2:I've already warned those who have sinned before and all the others, and I'm warning them again while I'm away: when I come back, I won't spare anyone.
47:13:3:You are seeking proof of Christ speaking through me, who is not weak toward you but is powerful among you.
47:13:4:Though He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God. We too are weak in Him, but we will live with Him through the power of God for your sake.
47:13:5:Examine yourselves to see whether you're in the faith; test yourselves. Don't you realize that Jesus Christ is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
47:13:6:And I trust that you'll discover we haven't failed the test.
47:13:7:Now we pray to God that you do no wrong—not so that we appear to have passed the test, but so that you may do what's right, even though we may seem to have failed.
47:13:8:We can't do anything against the truth, only for the truth.
47:13:9:In fact, we rejoice when we are weak but you are strong. Our prayer is for your perfection.
47:13:10:That's why I write these things while I'm away, so that when I'm there, I won't need to be harsh in using the authority the Lord gave me—for building up, not tearing down.
47:13:11:Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Aim for restoration, encourage one another, agree with each other, and live in peace. The God of love and peace will be with you.
47:13:12:Greet one another with a holy kiss.
47:13:13:All the saints send their greetings.
47:13:14:The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
