43:1:1:In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43:1:2:He existed in the beginning with God.
43:1:3:All things were made through him, and without him nothing was created that has been created.
43:1:4:In him was life, and that life was the light of humanity.
43:1:5:The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
43:1:6:A man named John was sent from God.
43:1:7:He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.
43:1:8:John himself wasn't the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.
43:1:9:The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.
43:1:10:He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world didn't recognize him.
43:1:11:He came to his own people, but they didn't accept him.
43:1:12:However, to all who did receive him and believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—
43:1:13:children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
43:1:14:The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43:1:15:John testified about him, crying out, "This is the one I spoke of when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"
43:1:16:From his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace.
43:1:17:For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
43:1:18:No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.
43:1:19:This is the testimony of John when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"
43:1:20:He confessed and did not deny it, but said, "I am not the Messiah."
43:1:21:So they asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He replied, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
43:1:22:Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43:1:23:John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"
43:1:24:Now the Pharisees who had been sent
43:1:25:questioned him, "Why do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
43:1:26:John answered them, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know.
43:1:27:He is the one who comes after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."
43:1:28:All this happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43:1:29:The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43:1:30:This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
43:1:31:I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."
43:1:32:Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
43:1:33:I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
43:1:34:I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One."
43:1:35:The next day, John was there again with two of his disciples.
43:1:36:When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
43:1:37:The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus.
43:1:38:Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"
43:1:39:"Come," he said, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.
43:1:40:Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and followed Jesus.
43:1:41:The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).
43:1:42:He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).
43:1:43:The next day, Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."
43:1:44:Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
43:1:45:Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43:1:46:Nathanael responded, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip replied, "Come and see."
43:1:47:When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit."
43:1:48:"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."
43:1:49:Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
43:1:50:Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that."
43:1:51:He then added, "Truly, truly, I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43:2:1:On the third day, a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,
43:2:2:and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
43:2:3:When they ran out of wine, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."
43:2:4:"Woman, why are you involving me?" Jesus replied, "My time has not yet come."
43:2:5:His mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
43:2:6:Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.
43:2:7:Jesus instructed them, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them up to the brim.
43:2:8:Then he said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,
43:2:9:and when the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine, he didn't know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the bridegroom over
43:2:10:and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."
43:2:11:This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
43:2:12:After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.
43:2:13:As the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43:2:14:In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as money changers seated at their tables.
43:2:15:So he made a whip out of cords and drove all of them from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
43:2:16:To those who sold doves, he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a marketplace!"
43:2:17:His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."
43:2:18:The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"
43:2:19:Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."
43:2:20:They retorted, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"
43:2:21:But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
43:2:22:After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
43:2:23:While he was in Jerusalem during the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.
43:2:24:But Jesus didn't entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.
43:2:25:He didn't need anyone to testify about human nature; he understood what was in each person.
43:3:1:Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a Jewish leader.
43:3:2:He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you're a teacher sent from God, for no one could perform the miracles you do unless God were with him."
43:3:3:Jesus replied, "I assure you, unless someone is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God."
43:3:4:Nicodemus asked, "How can a person be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time and be born?"
43:3:5:Jesus answered, "Truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.
43:3:6:What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.
43:3:7:Don't be surprised that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
43:3:8:The wind blows where it wants, and you hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
43:3:9:Nicodemus responded, "How can this be?"
43:3:10:Jesus said, "You're a respected teacher of Israel, and yet you don't understand these things?
43:3:11:I'm telling you the truth, we speak about what we know and testify to what we have seen, but still you people don't accept our testimony.
43:3:12:If I've told you about earthly things and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
43:3:13:No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.
43:3:14:Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
43:3:15:so that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
43:3:16:For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
43:3:17:God didn't send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it through him.
43:3:18:Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever doesn't believe is already condemned because they haven't believed in the name of God's only Son.
43:3:19:This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
43:3:20:Everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids it, for fear their actions will be exposed.
43:3:21:But those who live by the truth come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in the sight of God."
43:3:22:After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, where he spent time with them and baptized.
43:3:23:John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there, and people were coming to be baptized.
43:3:24:This happened before John was put in prison.
43:3:25:A debate arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
43:3:26:They came to John and said, "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."
43:3:27:John replied, "A person can only receive what is given them from heaven.
43:3:28:You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.'
43:3:29:The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
43:3:30:He must become greater; I must become less."
43:3:31:The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
43:3:32:He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
43:3:33:Whoever accepts his testimony confirms that God is truthful.
43:3:34:For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, because God gives the Spirit without limit.
43:3:35:The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
43:3:36:Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.
43:4:1:After Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,
43:4:2:although it wasn't Jesus himself who baptized, but his disciples,
43:4:3:he decided to leave Judea and return to Galilee.
43:4:4:To get there, he needed to pass through Samaria.
43:4:5:So he arrived at a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
43:4:6:Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
43:4:7:A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink."
43:4:8:His disciples had gone into town to buy food.
43:4:9:The Samaritan woman asked him, "How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" (Jews generally did not associate with Samaritans.)
43:4:10:Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
43:4:11:"Sir," she said, "you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?
43:4:12:Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?"
43:4:13:Jesus replied, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
43:4:14:but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
43:4:15:The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
43:4:16:He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."
43:4:17:"I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.
43:4:18:The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."
43:4:19:"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.
43:4:20:Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
43:4:21:"Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
43:4:22:You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
43:4:23:Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
43:4:24:God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and truth."
43:4:25:The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."
43:4:26:Then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you—I am he."
43:4:27:Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
43:4:28:Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,
43:4:29:"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?"
43:4:30:They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
43:4:31:Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."
43:4:32:But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
43:4:33:Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
43:4:34:"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
43:4:35:Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
43:4:36:Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
43:4:37:Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.
43:4:38:I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."
43:4:39:Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."
43:4:40:So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.
43:4:41:And because of his words, many more became believers.
43:4:42:They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."
43:4:43:After the two days, Jesus left for Galilee.
43:4:44:Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
43:4:45:When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.
43:4:46:Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
43:4:47:When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
43:4:48:"Unless you people see signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."
43:4:49:The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
43:4:50:"Go," Jesus replied, "your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
43:4:51:While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
43:4:52:When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him."
43:4:53:Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and his whole household believed.
43:4:54:This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
43:5:1:After this, there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43:5:2:In the city near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called Bethesda with five covered walkways.
43:5:3:Many sick people—blind, lame, and paralyzed—lay on these walkways.
43:5:4:For an angel would occasionally come down and stir the water; whoever stepped in first after the stirring would be healed of any illness they had.
43:5:5:A man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.
43:5:6:When Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in that condition for a long time, He asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
43:5:7:The sick man answered, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes ahead of me."
43:5:8:Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."
43:5:9:Immediately, the man was healed, picked up his mat, and started walking. Now this happened on the Sabbath day.
43:5:10:So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It's the Sabbath; it's not lawful for you to carry your mat."
43:5:11:He replied, "The man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
43:5:12:They asked him, "Who is this man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?"
43:5:13:The man who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.
43:5:14:Later, Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "Look, you are well now. Don't sin anymore, so that something worse doesn't happen to you."
43:5:15:The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43:5:16:So they began persecuting Jesus because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
43:5:17:Jesus responded, "My Father is always working, and I am working too."
43:5:18:This made the Jewish leaders even more determined to kill Him, not only because He was breaking the Sabbath, but also because He claimed God as His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
43:5:19:Jesus answered them, "Truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself; He can only do what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.
43:5:20:The Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He is doing. Greater works than these will He show Him, so that you may be amazed.
43:5:21:Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to those He chooses.
43:5:22:The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
43:5:23:so that everyone may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
43:5:24:I assure you, whoever hears My words and believes in the One who sent Me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.
43:5:25:Truly, I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
43:5:26:For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son also to have life in Himself.
43:5:27:And He has given Him authority to judge because He is the Son of Man.
43:5:28:Don't be surprised at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice
43:5:29:and come out—those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.
43:5:30:I can do nothing on My own. I judge only as I hear, and My judgment is just, for I seek not to please Myself but the One who sent Me.
43:5:31:If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not true.
43:5:32:There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is true.
43:5:33:You have sent messengers to John, and he has testified to the truth.
43:5:34:Although I don't accept human testimony, I mention this so that you may be saved.
43:5:35:John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and for a time you were willing to enjoy his light.
43:5:36:But I have a testimony greater than John's. The works the Father has given Me to complete, the very works I am doing, testify that the Father has sent Me.
43:5:37:Moreover, the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form,
43:5:38:and you do not have His word living in you, because you do not believe the One He sent.
43:5:39:You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about Me,
43:5:40:yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.
43:5:41:I don't accept praise from people,
43:5:42:but I know you—that you don't have the love of God in your hearts.
43:5:43:I have come in My Father's name, and you don't accept Me; but if someone else comes in their own name, you will accept them.
43:5:44:How can you believe since you accept praise from one another but don't seek the praise that comes from the only God?
43:5:45:Don't think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.
43:5:46:If you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.
43:5:47:But if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe My words?
43:6:1:After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
43:6:2:A large crowd followed Him because they had seen the miracles He performed on the sick.
43:6:3:Jesus went up a hill and sat down with His disciples.
43:6:4:The time for the Jewish Passover Festival was near.
43:6:5:When Jesus looked up and saw the large crowd coming toward Him, He asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread to feed these people?"
43:6:6:He said this to test Philip, for He already knew what He was going to do.
43:6:7:Philip replied, "Even if we worked for months, we wouldn't have enough money to feed them all!"
43:6:8:Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,
43:6:9:"There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that for such a crowd?"
43:6:10:Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
43:6:11:Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He did the same with the fish, giving as much as they wanted.
43:6:12:When everyone had eaten their fill, He told His disciples, "Gather the leftover pieces so nothing is wasted."
43:6:13:They gathered the leftovers and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
43:6:14:When the people saw the miracle Jesus had done, they said, "Truly, this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."
43:6:15:Realizing that they intended to force Him to be their king, Jesus withdrew again to a mountain by Himself.
43:6:16:As evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
43:6:17:got into a boat, and headed across the water toward Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
43:6:18:The wind blew strongly, and the waters grew rough.
43:6:19:When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat. They were terrified.
43:6:20:But He said to them, "It's me; don't be afraid."
43:6:21:They were willing to take Him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
43:6:22:The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone with His disciples in the boat, but that the disciples had left alone.
43:6:23:Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43:6:24:When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
43:6:25:When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
43:6:26:Jesus replied, "I assure you, you're looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
43:6:27:Don't work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him, God the Father has placed His seal of approval."
43:6:28:Then they asked Him, "What must we do to perform the works God requires?"
43:6:29:Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent."
43:6:30:So they asked Him, "What sign will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
43:6:31:Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
43:6:32:Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it's not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
43:6:33:The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43:6:34:"Sir," they said, "always give us this bread."
43:6:35:Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
43:6:36:But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
43:6:37:All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
43:6:38:For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of Him who sent me.
43:6:39:And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those He has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
43:6:40:For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."
43:6:41:At this, the Jews began to grumble about Him because He said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
43:6:42:They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can He now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"
43:6:43:"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.
43:6:44:"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43:6:45:It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to me.
43:6:46:No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only He has seen the Father.
43:6:47:Truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life.
43:6:48:I am the bread of life.
43:6:49:Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
43:6:50:But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.
43:6:51:I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
43:6:52:Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
43:6:53:Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.
43:6:54:Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.
43:6:55:For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
43:6:56:Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
43:6:57:Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
43:6:58:This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever."
43:6:59:He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43:6:60:On hearing it, many of His disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"
43:6:61:Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?
43:6:62:Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before!
43:6:63:The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.
43:6:64:Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.
43:6:65:He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them."
43:6:66:From this time many of His disciples turned back and no longer followed Him.
43:6:67:"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
43:6:68:Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
43:6:69:We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God."
43:6:70:Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"
43:6:71:He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray Him.
43:7:1:After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee; he didn't want to go through Judea because the Jewish leaders there sought to kill him.
43:7:2:Now, the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.
43:7:3:So, his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, so your disciples can see the works you're doing."
43:7:4:"No one who wants to be publicly known does things in secret. If you're doing these things, show yourself to the world."
43:7:5:For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
43:7:6:Jesus replied, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always right."
43:7:7:"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil."
43:7:8:"You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, for my time has not yet fully arrived."
43:7:9:Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.
43:7:10:But after his brothers had gone to the festival, he also went, not openly but in secret.
43:7:11:The Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival, asking, "Where is he?"
43:7:12:There was much murmuring among the people about him. Some said, "He's a good man," while others claimed, "No, he deceives the people."
43:7:13:However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders.
43:7:14:About halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began teaching.
43:7:15:The Jewish leaders were amazed and asked, "How does this man know so much without having studied?"
43:7:16:Jesus answered, "My teaching isn't mine but comes from the one who sent me."
43:7:17:"If anyone wants to do God's will, they'll know whether my teaching is from God or if I speak on my own."
43:7:18:"Whoever speaks on their own seeks personal glory, but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and there's no dishonesty in him."
43:7:19:"Didn't Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill me?"
43:7:20:The crowd replied, "You're possessed by a demon! Who's trying to kill you?"
43:7:21:Jesus responded, "I did one miracle, and you're all amazed."
43:7:22:"Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though it actually came from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath."
43:7:23:"If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's entire body on the Sabbath?"
43:7:24:"Stop judging by mere appearances, but judge with right judgment."
43:7:25:Some people from Jerusalem said, "Isn't this the man they want to kill?"
43:7:26:"Here he is, speaking publicly, and they're not saying anything to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he's the Messiah?"
43:7:27:"But we know where this man comes from. When the Messiah comes, no one will know where he's from."
43:7:28:Then, as Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he cried out, "You know me, and you know where I'm from. I haven't come on my own, but the one who sent me is true, and you don't know him."
43:7:29:"I know him because I am from him, and he sent me."
43:7:30:So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come.
43:7:31:Many in the crowd believed in him, saying, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?"
43:7:32:The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
43:7:33:Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I'll go to the one who sent me."
43:7:34:"You'll look for me, but you won't find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43:7:35:The Jewish leaders said to each other, "Where does he intend to go that we can't find him? Will he go to the dispersed Jews among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
43:7:36:"What did he mean when he said, 'You'll look for me, but you won't find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
43:7:37:On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink."
43:7:38:"Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them."
43:7:39:By this, he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time, the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
43:7:40:Upon hearing his words, some people in the crowd said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."
43:7:41:Others said, "He is the Messiah." But some asked, "How can the Messiah come from Galilee?"
43:7:42:"Doesn't the Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"
43:7:43:So the people were divided because of Jesus.
43:7:44:Some wanted to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him.
43:7:45:When the temple guards returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they asked, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
43:7:46:The guards replied, "No one ever spoke the way this man does."
43:7:47:"Are you also deceived?" the Pharisees retorted.
43:7:48:"Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?"
43:7:49:"No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there's a curse on them."
43:7:50:Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,
43:7:51:"Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?"
43:7:52:They replied, "Are you from Galilee too? Look into it, and you'll find that no prophet comes from Galilee."
43:7:53:Then each went to his own home.
43:8:1:Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43:8:2:Early in the morning, He returned to the temple courts. All the people gathered around Him, and He sat down to teach them.
43:8:3:The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group
43:8:4:and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
43:8:5:In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"
43:8:6:They were trying to trap Him, so they could accuse Him. But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with His finger.
43:8:7:When they persisted in questioning Him, He straightened up and said, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
43:8:8:Then He bent down again and continued writing on the ground.
43:8:9:Hearing this, those who accused her began to leave one by one, starting with the oldest until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
43:8:10:Jesus stood up and asked her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?"
43:8:11:"No one, sir," she replied. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."
43:8:12:Later, Jesus spoke to the people again, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life."
43:8:13:The Pharisees challenged Him, "You are testifying about yourself; your testimony is not valid."
43:8:14:Jesus answered, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I'm going.
43:8:15:You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
43:8:16:But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father who sent me.
43:8:17:In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.
43:8:18:I am one witness for myself, and my other witness is the Father who sent me."
43:8:19:Then they asked Him, "Where is your father?" Jesus replied, "You do not know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
43:8:20:He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His time had not yet come.
43:8:21:Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come."
43:8:22:The Jews wondered, "Will He kill himself? Is that why He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"
43:8:23:But Jesus continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not belong to this world.
43:8:24:I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am He, you will indeed die in your sins."
43:8:25:"Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been telling you from the beginning," Jesus replied.
43:8:26:"I have much to say in judgment of you. But He who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from Him I tell the world."
43:8:27:They did not understand that He was talking to them about the Father.
43:8:28:So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
43:8:29:The One who sent me is with me; He has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases Him."
43:8:30:As He spoke these words, many believed in Him.
43:8:31:To the Jews who had believed Him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
43:8:32:Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
43:8:33:They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"
43:8:34:Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
43:8:35:A slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
43:8:36:So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
43:8:37:I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
43:8:38:I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father."
43:8:39:"Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do what Abraham did.
43:8:40:As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
43:8:41:You are doing the works of your own father." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."
43:8:42:Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
43:8:43:Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
43:8:44:You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
43:8:45:Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
43:8:46:Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?
43:8:47:Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."
43:8:48:The Jews answered Him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"
43:8:49:"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
43:8:50:I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is One who seeks it, and He is the judge.
43:8:51:Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death."
43:8:52:At this they exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.
43:8:53:Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
43:8:54:Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
43:8:55:Though you do not know Him, I know Him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and obey His word.
43:8:56:Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
43:8:57:"You are not yet fifty years old," they said to Him, "and you have seen Abraham!"
43:8:58:"Very truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"
43:8:59:At this, they picked up stones to stone Him, but Jesus hid Himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
43:9:1:As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been blind since birth.
43:9:2:His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43:9:3:Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned. He was born blind so that God's work might be revealed in him.
43:9:4:We must carry out the tasks of the One who sent me while it is still day. Night is coming when no one can work.
43:9:5:As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43:9:6:After saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.
43:9:7:Then he told him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came back able to see.
43:9:8:The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar said, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"
43:9:9:Some claimed, "It's him," while others said, "No, but he looks like him." The man himself insisted, "I am the one."
43:9:10:They asked him, "How were your eyes opened?"
43:9:11:He replied, "The man called Jesus made mud, put it on my eyes, and told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."
43:9:12:"Where is he?" they asked. The man answered, "I don't know."
43:9:13:They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.
43:9:14:The day Jesus made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.
43:9:15:So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He told them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see."
43:9:16:Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" They were divided.
43:9:17:They turned again to the blind man, "What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."
43:9:18:The Jewish leaders did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned the man's parents
43:9:19:and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it that he can now see?"
43:9:20:His parents answered, "We know this is our son and that he was born blind.
43:9:21:But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."
43:9:22:His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.
43:9:23:That's why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
43:9:24:A second time they called the man who had been blind and told him, "Give glory to God! We know this man is a sinner."
43:9:25:He answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner or not. One thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!"
43:9:26:They asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
43:9:27:He replied, "I have already told you, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?"
43:9:28:Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
43:9:29:We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we don't even know where he comes from."
43:9:30:The man answered, "That's remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
43:9:31:We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to those who worship him and do his will.
43:9:32:Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
43:9:33:If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
43:9:34:They replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.
43:9:35:Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43:9:36:"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."
43:9:37:Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
43:9:38:Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.
43:9:39:Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."
43:9:40:Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"
43:9:41:Jesus replied, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains."
43:10:1:In the beginning, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't enter the sheepfold through the gate but climbs in another way is a thief and a robber."
43:10:2:However, the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
43:10:3:The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice. He calls each of them by name and leads them out.
43:10:4:When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
43:10:5:They will never follow a stranger; instead, they will run away from him because they don't recognize the voice of strangers."
43:10:6:Jesus used this illustration, but they didn't understand what he was telling them.
43:10:7:So Jesus explained further, "Truly, I am the gate for the sheep.
43:10:8:All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.
43:10:9:I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out and find pasture.
43:10:10:The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it more abundantly.
43:10:11:"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43:10:12:The hired hand, who isn't the shepherd and doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away. Then the wolf attacks and scatters the flock.
43:10:13:The man runs away because he's only a hired hand and doesn't care about the sheep.
43:10:14:"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and they know me,
43:10:15:just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.
43:10:16:I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.
43:10:17:This is why the Father loves me because I lay down my life to take it up again.
43:10:18:No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."
43:10:19:There was a division among the Jews because of these words.
43:10:20:Many of them said, "He's demon-possessed and insane. Why do you listen to him?"
43:10:21:Others replied, "These aren't the words of someone possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43:10:22:Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
43:10:23:and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade.
43:10:24:The Jews gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
43:10:25:Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you don't believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify about me.
43:10:26:But you don't believe because you're not my sheep.
43:10:27:My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
43:10:28:I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of my hand.
43:10:29:My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of the Father's hand.
43:10:30:I and the Father are one."
43:10:31:Again, the Jews picked up stones to stone him,
43:10:32:but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"
43:10:33:The Jews answered, "We're not stoning you for any good work but for blasphemy because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
43:10:34:Jesus replied, "Isn't it written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'?
43:10:35:If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—
43:10:36:how can you accuse me of blasphemy for saying, 'I am the Son of God,' when I was sent into the world by the Father?
43:10:37:If I'm not doing my Father's works, don't believe me.
43:10:38:But if I am, even though you don't believe me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father."
43:10:39:Again, they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their grasp.
43:10:40:Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed,
43:10:41:and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true."
43:10:42:And in that place, many believed in Jesus.
43:11:1:A certain man named Lazarus, from the village of Bethany, was sick. He was the brother of Mary and Martha.
43:11:2:It was this same Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was now ill.
43:11:3:So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, "Lord, the one you love is sick."
43:11:4:When Jesus heard this, he said, "This sickness won't end in death; instead, it's for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
43:11:5:Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.
43:11:6:However, when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.
43:11:7:Afterward, he told his disciples, "Let's return to Judea."
43:11:8:The disciples responded, "Rabbi, just recently the Jews tried to stone you, and you're going back there?"
43:11:9:Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If someone walks during the day, they don't stumble because they can see the world illuminated by the sun."
43:11:10:"But if someone walks at night, they'll stumble since they have no light."
43:11:11:After saying this, he added, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I'm going to wake him up."
43:11:12:The disciples replied, "Lord, if he's sleeping, he'll get better."
43:11:13:Jesus had been speaking about Lazarus' death, but they thought he meant natural sleep.
43:11:14:So he clarified, "Lazarus is dead."
43:11:15:"For your sake, I'm glad I wasn't there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him."
43:11:16:Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the other disciples, "Let's go too, so we can die with him."
43:11:17:When Jesus arrived, he discovered that Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days.
43:11:18:Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.
43:11:19:Many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary over their brother's death.
43:11:20:As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. But Mary stayed at home.
43:11:21:Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died."
43:11:22:"But even now, I know that God will give you whatever you ask."
43:11:23:Jesus replied, "Your brother will rise again."
43:11:24:Martha answered, "I know he'll rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
43:11:25:Jesus declared, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, even though they die, will live."
43:11:26:"And everyone who lives and believes in me will never truly die. Do you believe this?"
43:11:27:"Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who has come into the world."
43:11:28:After saying this, she went back and called her sister Mary, whispering, "The Teacher is here and wants to see you."
43:11:29:When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
43:11:30:Jesus had not yet entered the village; he was still at the place where Martha had met him.
43:11:31:The Jews who were comforting Mary in the house noticed how quickly she got up and left. They followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
43:11:32:When Mary reached Jesus and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died."
43:11:33:Seeing her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, Jesus was deeply moved and troubled.
43:11:34:"Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.
43:11:35:Jesus wept.
43:11:36:Then the Jews said, "See how much he loved him!"
43:11:37:But some of them asked, "Couldn't he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"
43:11:38:Jesus, once again deeply moved, approached the tomb. It was a cave with a stone placed across the entrance.
43:11:39:"Take away the stone," Jesus said. But Martha, the sister of the dead man, objected, "Lord, by now there will be a bad odor, for he has been dead four days."
43:11:40:Jesus responded, "Didn't I tell you that if you believe, you'll see the glory of God?"
43:11:41:So they removed the stone. Then Jesus looked up and prayed, "Father, I thank you for hearing me."
43:11:42:"I know that you always hear me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that you sent me."
43:11:43:After saying this, he called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
43:11:44:The dead man emerged, his hands and feet wrapped in linen strips, and a cloth covering his face. Jesus instructed them, "Unwrap him and let him go."
43:11:45:As a result, many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.
43:11:46:But some went to the Pharisees and reported what Jesus had done.
43:11:47:Consequently, the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and asked, "What are we going to do? This man is performing many miraculous signs."
43:11:48:"If we let him continue like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation."
43:11:49:One of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!"
43:11:50:"You don't realize that it's better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to perish."
43:11:51:Caiaphas didn't say this on his own, but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation.
43:11:52:Not only for the nation, but also to bring together the scattered children of God.
43:11:53:From that day on, they plotted to kill Jesus.
43:11:54:So Jesus no longer moved about openly among the Jews. Instead, he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
43:11:55:As the Jewish Passover approached, many people went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.
43:11:56:They kept looking for Jesus and, as they stood in the temple courts, they asked one another, "What do you think? Will he not come to the festival at all?"
43:11:57:The chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, they should report it so they could arrest him.
43:12:1:Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the dead.
43:12:2:There they hosted a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
43:12:3:Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume, and anointed Jesus' feet, wiping them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
43:12:4:But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who would later betray him, objected.
43:12:5:"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages."
43:12:6:He didn't say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
43:12:7:"Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
43:12:8:You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."
43:12:9:A large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
43:12:10:So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
43:12:11:for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.
43:12:12:The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
43:12:13:They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!"
43:12:14:Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
43:12:15:"Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."
43:12:16:At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.
43:12:17:Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
43:12:18:Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.
43:12:19:So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"
43:12:20:Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.
43:12:21:They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."
43:12:22:Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
43:12:23:Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43:12:24:Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
43:12:25:Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
43:12:26:Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
43:12:27:"Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
43:12:28:Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
43:12:29:The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
43:12:30:Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
43:12:31:Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.
43:12:32:And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
43:12:33:He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
43:12:34:The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
43:12:35:Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.
43:12:36:Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
43:12:37:Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
43:12:38:This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43:12:39:For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
43:12:40:"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn—and I would heal them."
43:12:41:Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.
43:12:42:Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
43:12:43:for they loved human praise more than praise from God.
43:12:44:Then Jesus cried out, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.
43:12:45:The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.
43:12:46:I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
43:12:47:"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
43:12:48:There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
43:12:49:For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.
43:12:50:I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."
43:13:1:Before the Passover festival began, Jesus knew that his time had come to leave this world and return to the Father. He loved his own who were in the world, and he loved them to the end.
43:13:2:The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put the idea of betraying Jesus into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son.
43:13:3:Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and was going back to God.
43:13:4:So, during the meal, he got up from the table, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
43:13:5:Next, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
43:13:6:When he came to Simon Peter, Peter asked, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
43:13:7:Jesus replied, "You don't understand what I'm doing now, but later on, you will."
43:13:8:Peter insisted, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me."
43:13:9:Simon Peter said, "Then, Lord, not just my feet but also my hands and my head!"
43:13:10:Jesus explained, "A person who has bathed needs only to wash their feet; they are completely clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."
43:13:11:He said this because he knew who would betray him; that's why he added, "Not all of you are clean."
43:13:12:After washing their feet, Jesus put on his clothes and returned to his place. He asked, "Do you understand what I've done for you?"
43:13:13:"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.
43:13:14:Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
43:13:15:I have set an example for you, so you should do as I have done for you.
43:13:16:Truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than their master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent them.
43:13:17:If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
43:13:18:I'm not referring to all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: 'He who shares my bread has turned against me.'
43:13:19:I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe that I am who I am.
43:13:20:Truly, I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
43:13:21:After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled in spirit and testified, "I assure you, one of you will betray me."
43:13:22:The disciples looked at one another, unsure of whom he meant.
43:13:23:One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.
43:13:24:Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."
43:13:25:Leaning back against Jesus, the disciple asked, "Lord, who is it?"
43:13:26:Jesus answered, "It's the one to whom I give this piece of bread after I have dipped it." Then he dipped the bread and gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon's son.
43:13:27:As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus told him, "Do what you're going to do, and do it quickly."
43:13:28:No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas.
43:13:29:Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the poor.
43:13:30:Judas took the bread and went out immediately. It was night.
43:13:31:When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
43:13:32:If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify the Son in himself and will glorify him at once.
43:13:33:My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jewish leaders, 'Where I am going, you cannot come,' now I tell you the same.
43:13:34:A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
43:13:35:By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another."
43:13:36:Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."
43:13:37:Peter said, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
43:13:38:Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? Truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."
43:14:1:Don't let your hearts be troubled; believe in God, and also believe in me.
43:14:2:In my Father's house are many rooms; if it weren't so, I would have told you. I'm going to prepare a place for you.
43:14:3:And when everything is ready, I will come back and take you with me, so that you may be where I am.
43:14:4:You know the way to the place where I am going.
43:14:5:Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you're going, so how can we know the way?"
43:14:6:Jesus replied, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
43:14:7:If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."
43:14:8:Philip asked, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
43:14:9:Jesus answered, "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you for such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
43:14:10:Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words I say to you aren't just my own; they come from the Father who lives in me and does his work through me.
43:14:11:Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe because of the works themselves.
43:14:12:Truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father.
43:14:13:And whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, so that the Father may be glorified through the Son.
43:14:14:If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
43:14:15:If you love me, keep my commandments.
43:14:16:And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to help you and be with you forever—
43:14:17:the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
43:14:18:I won't leave you as orphans; I will come back to you.
43:14:19:In a little while, the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.
43:14:20:On that day, you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
43:14:21:Whoever has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them."
43:14:22:Judas (not Iscariot) asked, "Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?"
43:14:23:Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, they will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.
43:14:24:Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
43:14:25:All this I have spoken while still with you.
43:14:26:But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have said to you.
43:14:27:Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
43:14:28:You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
43:14:29:I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe.
43:14:30:I won't speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,
43:14:31:but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. Come now, let us leave.
43:15:1:I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
43:15:2:He takes away every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, while he prunes the fruitful ones so they'll produce even more.
43:15:3:You are already clean because of the message I've spoken to you.
43:15:4:Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it stays connected to the vine, neither can you unless you stay connected to me.
43:15:5:I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you'll bear much fruit; apart from me, you can do nothing.
43:15:6:If anyone does not remain in me, they're like a branch thrown away and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.
43:15:7:If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
43:15:8:By bearing much fruit, you show yourselves to be my disciples, and this is how my Father is glorified.
43:15:9:As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now continue in my love.
43:15:10:If you keep my commandments, you'll remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love.
43:15:11:I've told you these things so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
43:15:12:This is my commandment: Love one another as I have loved you.
43:15:13:Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.
43:15:14:You are my friends if you do what I command.
43:15:15:I no longer call you servants, because a servant doesn't know what his master is doing. Instead, I've called you friends, for everything I've learned from my Father, I've made known to you.
43:15:16:You didn't choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name, the Father will give you.
43:15:17:This is my command: Love one another.
43:15:18:If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
43:15:19:If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. But since you don't belong to the world, because I've chosen you out of it, the world hates you.
43:15:20:Remember the words I spoke to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they'll persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they'll obey yours too.
43:15:21:They'll treat you this way because of my name, for they don't know the One who sent me.
43:15:22:If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
43:15:23:Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
43:15:24:If I hadn't done among them the works no one else did, they wouldn't be guilty of sin. But now they've seen these miracles, and yet they've hated both me and my Father.
43:15:25:This happened to fulfill the word written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'
43:15:26:When the Advocate comes, whom I'll send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
43:15:27:And you also must testify, for you've been with me from the beginning.
43:16:1:In this chapter, Jesus said to his disciples, "I'm telling you all this so you won't be caught off guard.
43:16:2:You'll be thrown out of synagogues; in fact, a time is coming when people who kill you will think they're doing God a favor.
43:16:3:They'll do these things because they haven't known the Father or me.
43:16:4:But I've told you this so that when their time comes, you'll remember what I warned you about. I didn't say this earlier because I was with you.
43:16:5:Now, however, I'm going back to the One who sent me, but none of you asks me where I'm going.
43:16:6:Because I've said these things, you're filled with sorrow.
43:16:7:Yet, it's for your own good that I go away. If I don't, the Helper won't come to you; but if I do, I'll send him to you.
43:16:8:When he arrives, he'll expose the world's guilt about sin, righteousness, and judgment.
43:16:9:Regarding sin, because they don't believe in me;
43:16:10:Concerning righteousness, because I'm going to the Father and you won't see me anymore;
43:16:11:And about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.
43:16:12:I still have much more to tell you, but you can't bear it now.
43:16:13:However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he'll guide you into all truth. He won't speak on his own authority, but will tell you whatever he hears, and reveal to you things to come.
43:16:14:He'll glorify me, because he'll take what's mine and disclose it to you.
43:16:15:Everything the Father has is mine; that's why I said he'll take what's mine and reveal it to you.
43:16:16:In a little while, you won't see me anymore; but then, after a little while, you will see me."
43:16:17:Some disciples asked one another, "What does he mean by 'in a little while'? We don't understand what he's saying."
43:16:18:Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said, "Are you wondering what I meant when I said, 'In a little while, you won't see me, and then after a little while, you will see me'?
43:16:19:Truly, I tell you, you'll weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You'll be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.
43:16:20:When a woman gives birth, she's in pain because her time has come; but once the baby is born, she forgets the anguish for joy that a child has been born into the world.
43:16:21:So you have sorrow now, but I'll see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
43:16:22:On that day, you won't ask me anything. Truly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he'll give you.
43:16:23:Until now, you haven't asked for anything in my name. Ask and you'll receive, so that your joy may be complete.
43:16:24:I've spoken these things to you using figures of speech. A time is coming when I won't use figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
43:16:25:On that day, you'll ask in my name. I'm not saying I'll ask the Father on your behalf,
43:16:26:For the Father himself loves you, because you've loved me and believed that I came from God.
43:16:27:I came from the Father and entered the world; now I'm leaving the world and going back to the Father."
43:16:28:His disciples said, "Now you're speaking plainly and not using figures of speech!
43:16:29:We believe that you came from God."
43:16:30:Jesus answered them, "Do you believe now?
43:16:31:Look, a time is coming—and has already come—when you'll be scattered, each to your own home, and you'll leave me all alone. Yet I'm not alone, for the Father is with me.
43:16:32:I've told you these things so you may have peace in me. In this world, you'll face troubles, but take heart; I've overcome the world."
43:17:1:Jesus spoke these words, lifting his eyes to the sky and said, "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son so that your Son may glorify you.
43:17:2:For you have granted him authority over all people, allowing him to give eternal life to everyone you have given him.
43:17:3:And this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
43:17:4:I have glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
43:17:5:Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.
43:17:6:I revealed your name to the people you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word.
43:17:7:They now know that everything you've given me comes from you.
43:17:8:For I have given them the words you gave me, and they have accepted them. They understood that I came from you and believed that you sent me.
43:17:9:I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, because they belong to you.
43:17:10:All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And my glory is shown through them.
43:17:11:I will no longer be in the world, but they will remain in it while I return to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name—the name you gave me—so they may be one, just as we are one.
43:17:12:While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by the name you gave me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the one doomed to destruction, fulfilling the Scripture.
43:17:13:Now I am coming to you, and I say these things while I'm still in the world, so they may have my joy completed in themselves.
43:17:14:I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
43:17:15:I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one.
43:17:16:They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
43:17:17:Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
43:17:18:As you sent me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
43:17:19:For their sake, I sanctify myself, so they too may be truly sanctified.
43:17:20:I am not only praying for these disciples, but also for those who will believe in me through their message.
43:17:21:May they all be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us, so the world may believe that you have sent me.
43:17:22:I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one—
43:17:23:I in them and you in me—so they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
43:17:24:Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so they can see my glory, which you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
43:17:25:Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.
43:17:26:I have made your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love you have for me may be in them, and I may be in them."
43:18:1:When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which He and His followers entered.
43:18:2:Now Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with His disciples.
43:18:3:So Judas, having obtained a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came to the garden with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
43:18:4:Jesus, knowing everything that would happen to Him, stepped forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
43:18:5:They replied, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus told them, "I am He." Judas, who betrayed Him, was also standing with them.
43:18:6:As Jesus said, "I am He," they drew back and fell to the ground.
43:18:7:Again, He asked them, "Who are you looking for?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
43:18:8:Jesus answered, "I told you that I am He. If you're looking for me, let these men go."
43:18:9:This happened so that the words He had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."
43:18:10:Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
43:18:11:Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"
43:18:12:Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and bound Him.
43:18:13:They led Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
43:18:14:Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be better for one man to die for the people.
43:18:15:Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since this other disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard.
43:18:16:But Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
43:18:17:The girl at the door said to Peter, "Aren't you also one of this man's disciples?" He replied, "I am not."
43:18:18:Now the servants and officials had made a fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it, warming themselves. Peter also stood with them, warming himself.
43:18:19:Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.
43:18:20:Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
43:18:21:Why question me? Ask those who heard me. They know what I said."
43:18:22:When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped Him in the face. "Is this any way to answer the high priest?" he demanded.
43:18:23:Jesus replied, "If I said something wrong, testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"
43:18:24:Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
43:18:25:As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "Aren't you also one of His disciples?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."
43:18:26:One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with Him in the garden?"
43:18:27:Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
43:18:28:Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor's headquarters. It was early morning, and the Jewish leaders did not enter the headquarters themselves; they wanted to avoid ceremonial uncleanness so they could eat the Passover.
43:18:29:So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"
43:18:30:They replied, "If He were not a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you."
43:18:31:Pilate said, "Take Him yourselves and judge Him by your own law." The Jewish leaders responded, "But we have no right to execute anyone."
43:18:32:This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death He was going to die.
43:18:33:Then Pilate went back into the headquarters, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
43:18:34:Jesus answered, "Are you asking this on your own, or did others tell you about me?"
43:18:35:Pilate replied, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?"
43:18:36:Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place."
43:18:37:"So you are a king, then?" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
43:18:38:"What is truth?" retorted Pilate. With this, he went out again to the Jewish leaders and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
43:18:39:But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the King of the Jews'?"
43:18:40:They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.
43:19:1:Pilate then took Jesus and had him flogged.
43:19:2:The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe
43:19:3:and kept coming up to him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" They slapped him repeatedly.
43:19:4:Pilate went outside again and said to the crowd, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to show that I find no basis for a charge against him."
43:19:5:So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
43:19:6:When the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."
43:19:7:The Jewish leaders insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."
43:19:8:When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
43:19:9:and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
43:19:10:"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"
43:19:11:Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
43:19:12:From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
43:19:13:When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
43:19:14:It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.
43:19:15:But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate asked, "Shall I crucify your king?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
43:19:16:Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
43:19:17:Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
43:19:18:There they crucified him, along with two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
43:19:19:Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
43:19:20:Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
43:19:21:The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."
43:19:22:Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
43:19:23:When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
43:19:24:"Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.
43:19:25:Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43:19:26:When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son,"
43:19:27:and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
43:19:28:Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."
43:19:29:A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
43:19:30:When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
43:19:31:Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
43:19:32:The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
43:19:33:But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
43:19:34:Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.
43:19:35:The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
43:19:36:These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken,"
43:19:37:and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
43:19:38:Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
43:19:39:He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
43:19:40:Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
43:19:41:At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
43:19:42:Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
43:20:1:Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
43:20:2:So she ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and told them, "They've taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they've put him!"
43:20:3:Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
43:20:4:Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
43:20:5:He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
43:20:6:Then Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
43:20:7:as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.
43:20:8:Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
43:20:9:(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)
43:20:10:The disciples then went back to their homes.
43:20:11:But Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb
43:20:12:and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
43:20:13:They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She replied, "They have taken my Lord away, and I don't know where they've put him."
43:20:14:At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
43:20:15:He asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."
43:20:16:Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher").
43:20:17:Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
43:20:18:Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.
43:20:19:On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43:20:20:After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
43:20:21:Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
43:20:22:And with that, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43:20:23:If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
43:20:24:Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called Didymus, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
43:20:25:So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43:20:26:A week later, his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43:20:27:Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
43:20:28:Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
43:20:29:Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
43:20:30:Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
43:20:31:But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
43:21:1:After these events, Jesus revealed himself to the disciples once more by the Sea of Tiberias. This is how it happened:
43:21:2:Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
43:21:3:Simon Peter said, "I'm going fishing." The others replied, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they didn't catch anything.
43:21:4:As morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn't recognize that it was him.
43:21:5:Jesus called out to them, "Friends, have you caught any fish?" They answered, "No."
43:21:6:He told them, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some." They did as he said, and suddenly they couldn't haul the net in because there were so many fish.
43:21:7:Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard this, he put on his outer garment (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
43:21:8:The other disciples followed in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards away.
43:21:9:When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it, and some bread.
43:21:10:Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."
43:21:11:Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153 in total, but even with so many, the net was not torn.
43:21:12:Jesus invited them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Lord.
43:21:13:Then Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them, along with the fish.
43:21:14:This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.
43:21:15:After they finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" Peter replied, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
43:21:16:He asked again, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus told him, "Take care of my sheep."
43:21:17:For a third time, Jesus asked, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He replied, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
43:21:18:Truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you don't want to go."
43:21:19:Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
43:21:20:Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had asked, "Lord, who is going to betray you?"
43:21:21:When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"
43:21:22:Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what concern is that of yours? You must follow me."
43:21:23:Because of this, a rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he wouldn't die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what concern is that of yours?"
43:21:24:This is the disciple who testifies to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.
43:21:25:There are also many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
