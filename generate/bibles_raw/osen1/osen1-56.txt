56:1:1:Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen people and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,
56:1:2:In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began,
56:1:3:And has revealed his word at the right time through preaching, which I have been entrusted with by the command of God our Savior;
56:1:4:To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56:1:5:For this reason, I left you in Crete, so you could set things in order and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
56:1:6:An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, with children who believe and are not accused of wild living or rebellion.
56:1:7:As an overseer of God's household, he must be above reproach; not arrogant, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, and not greedy for dishonest gain.
56:1:8:Instead, he should be hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.
56:1:9:Holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it was taught, so he can encourage others with sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
56:1:10:For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially among the circumcision party.
56:1:11:They must be silenced because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they should not, all for dishonest gain.
56:1:12:One of Crete's own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons."
56:1:13:This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so they may be sound in the faith,
56:1:14:Not paying attention to Jewish myths or the commands of people who reject the truth.
56:1:15:To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, for their minds and consciences are corrupted.
56:1:16:They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
56:2:1:As for you, teach what aligns with sound doctrine.
56:2:2:Older men should be sober, dignified, self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and endurance.
56:2:3:Similarly, older women must behave reverently, not gossiping or being enslaved to wine, but teaching good things.
56:2:4:They should guide younger women to love their husbands and children,
56:2:5:to be sensible, pure, dedicated to their homes, kind, and submissive to their husbands, so that God's word is not discredited.
56:2:6:Encourage young men to be self-controlled as well.
56:2:7:In everything, set an example of good works, displaying integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be criticized.
56:2:8:This way, opponents will have nothing bad to say about us, and they will be put to shame.
56:2:9:Urge slaves to submit to their masters, pleasing them in every respect, not talking back or stealing,
56:2:10:but demonstrating complete trustworthiness, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every way.
56:2:11:For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people,
56:2:12:instructing us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in this present age,
56:2:13:as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
56:2:14:He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for himself a people who are his very own, zealous for good deeds.
56:2:15:Declare these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
56:3:1:Remember to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to always be ready for every good work.
56:3:2:Avoid speaking ill of others, be peaceful, considerate, and display a gentle attitude towards everyone.
56:3:3:For we too were once foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.
56:3:4:But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
56:3:5:He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
56:3:6:This Spirit He generously poured out on us through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56:3:7:So that, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs with the hope of eternal life.
56:3:8:This saying is trustworthy. I want you to emphasize these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and beneficial for everyone.
56:3:9:But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and useless.
56:3:10:Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.
56:3:11:You can be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
