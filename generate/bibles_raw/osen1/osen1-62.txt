62:1:1:We want to share with you what has existed from the beginning, which we have heard, seen with our eyes, and touched with our hands. This is about the Word of Life.
62:1:2:The life was revealed to us, and we have seen it and testify to it. We now proclaim to you the eternal life that was with the Father and has been made known to us.
62:1:3:We are telling you about what we have personally experienced, so that you may also have fellowship with us. And truly, our fellowship is with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ.
62:1:4:We write these things to you so that your joy may be complete.
62:1:5:This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.
62:1:6:If we claim to have fellowship with him but continue living in darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth.
62:1:7:However, if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
62:1:8:If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
62:1:9:But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
62:1:10:If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his word is not in us.
62:2:1:My dear friends, I write this to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, who is righteous.
62:2:2:He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
62:2:3:By this, we know that we have come to know him: if we keep his commandments.
62:2:4:Whoever says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.
62:2:5:But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him:
62:2:6:Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.
62:2:7:Beloved, I am not writing you a new command, but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.
62:2:8:Yet, I am also writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
62:2:9:Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness.
62:2:10:Whoever loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.
62:2:11:But whoever hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; they do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.
62:2:12:I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
62:2:13:I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have overcome the evil one.
62:2:14:I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
62:2:15:Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in them.
62:2:16:For everything in the world—the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.
62:2:17:The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
62:2:18:Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour.
62:2:19:They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
62:2:20:But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
62:2:21:I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.
62:2:22:Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son.
62:2:23:No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
62:2:24:As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
62:2:25:And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
62:2:26:I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
62:2:27:As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.
62:2:28:And now, dear children, continue to live in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
62:2:29:If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
62:3:1:Consider the amazing love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are. The world does not recognize us because it did not recognize Him.
62:3:2:Beloved, we are now God's children, and what we will become has not yet been revealed. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like Him, for we will see Him as He is.
62:3:3:Everyone who has this hope in Christ purifies themselves, just as He is pure.
62:3:4:Anyone who commits sin breaks God's law; indeed, sin is lawlessness.
62:3:5:You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.
62:3:6:No one who remains in Christ keeps on sinning; anyone who continues to sin has not seen Him or known Him.
62:3:7:Dear children, do not let anyone deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
62:3:8:The one who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
62:3:9:No one born of God continues to sin, because God's seed abides in them; they cannot go on sinning, for they have been born of God.
62:3:10:By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love their brother or sister.
62:3:11:For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another.
62:3:12:Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous.
62:3:13:Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.
62:3:14:We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love remains in death.
62:3:15:Anyone who hates their brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in them.
62:3:16:This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
62:3:17:If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
62:3:18:Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
62:3:19:By this, we will know that we belong to the truth and will reassure our hearts before Him.
62:3:20:If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and He knows everything.
62:3:21:Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
62:3:22:and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we obey His commands and do what pleases Him.
62:3:23:And this is His command: to believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as He commanded us.
62:3:24:Those who obey His commands live in Him, and He in them. And this is how we know that He lives in us: We know it by the Spirit He gave us.
62:4:1:Dear friends, don't just believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
62:4:2:Here's how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
62:4:3:and any spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and is already in the world now.
62:4:4:You, however, are from God, dear children, and have overcome them because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
62:4:5:Those people belong to the world; that's why they speak from a worldly perspective, and the world listens to them.
62:4:6:We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but those who do not know God do not listen to us. This is how we can tell the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.
62:4:7:Let's love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
62:4:8:Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
62:4:9:God showed his love among us by sending his only Son into the world so that we might live through him.
62:4:10:This is what real love is: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
62:4:11:Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another.
62:4:12:No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
62:4:13:We know that we live in him and he in us because he has given us his Spirit.
62:4:14:And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
62:4:15:If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.
62:4:16:And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.
62:4:17:In this way, love is made complete among us so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him.
62:4:18:There is no fear in love. Instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
62:4:19:We love because he first loved us.
62:4:20:If someone says, "I love God," but hates a fellow believer, that person is a liar; for if we don't love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see?
62:4:21:And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their fellow believers.
62:5:1:Believing that Jesus is the Christ makes us God's children, and loving the Father means we love His children too.
62:5:2:We know we love God's children when we love God and obey His commands.
62:5:3:Loving God means keeping His commandments, and His commandments are not burdensome.
62:5:4:For everyone born of God overcomes the world. Our faith is the victory that conquers the world.
62:5:5:Who can overcome the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
62:5:6:Jesus Christ came through water and blood—not just water, but water and blood. The Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is the truth.
62:5:7:There are three witnesses in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.
62:5:8:And there are three witnesses on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.
62:5:9:If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony He has given about His Son.
62:5:10:Whoever believes in the Son of God has this testimony within themselves. Whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about His Son.
62:5:11:This testimony is that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
62:5:12:Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
62:5:13:I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
62:5:14:We can approach God with confidence because if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
62:5:15:And if we know that He hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of Him.
62:5:16:If you see a fellow believer committing a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray for them. God will give them life. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying you should pray about that.
62:5:17:All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
62:5:18:We know that those born of God do not continue in sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.
62:5:19:We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the control of the evil one.
62:5:20:We also know that the Son of God has come and given us understanding so that we may know the true God. We are in the true God—in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
62:5:21:Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
