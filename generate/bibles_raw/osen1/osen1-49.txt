49:1:1:Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus.
49:1:2:May grace and peace be with you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49:1:3:Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has showered us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms through Christ.
49:1:4:God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him in love.
49:1:5:In His love, He predestined us for adoption as His children through Jesus Christ, according to His pleasure and will,
49:1:6:to the praise of His glorious grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
49:1:7:In Christ, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace
49:1:8:which He lavished upon us, providing us with wisdom and understanding.
49:1:9:He revealed to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He planned in Christ,
49:1:10:to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and on earth, under His authority when the time is right.
49:1:11:In Christ, we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will,
49:1:12:so that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might bring praise to His glory.
49:1:13:In Him, you also heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; and after you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
49:1:14:who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession, to the praise of His glory.
49:1:15:For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
49:1:16:I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
49:1:17:asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
49:1:18:May the eyes of your heart be enlightened so that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,
49:1:19:and the incomparable greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty strength.
49:1:20:This power He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,
49:1:21:far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and every name that can be named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
49:1:22:God placed everything under Christ's feet and appointed Him as head over everything for the church,
49:1:23:which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.
49:2:1:Once, you were spiritually dead due to your disobedience and sins.
49:2:2:In the past, you followed the ways of this world and the ruler of the realm of the air—the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
49:2:3:All of us used to live among them, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and following its impulses. We were naturally deserving of wrath, just like everyone else.
49:2:4:However, God's great love for us and his abundant mercy,
49:2:5:made us alive together with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.
49:2:6:And he raised us up with him and seated us together with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
49:2:7:in order to show the incomparable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
49:2:8:For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,
49:2:9:not by works, so that no one can boast.
49:2:10:We are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to accomplish.
49:2:11:Remember that once you were Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "circumcised."
49:2:12:At that time you were without Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
49:2:13:But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
49:2:14:For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
49:2:15:by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,
49:2:16:and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
49:2:17:He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
49:2:18:Through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
49:2:19:Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of his household,
49:2:20:built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
49:2:21:In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
49:2:22:And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
49:3:1:Because of this, I, Paul, am a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles.
49:3:2:You've surely heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for your benefit,
49:3:3:how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have briefly written earlier.
49:3:4:By reading this, you can perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ,
49:3:5:which in other generations was not made known to humanity, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
49:3:6:that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
49:3:7:I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace, which was given to me by the working of his power.
49:3:8:To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
49:3:9:and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things,
49:3:10:so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
49:3:11:This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
49:3:12:in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.
49:3:13:So I ask you not to lose heart over my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
49:3:14:For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,
49:3:15:from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
49:3:16:that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
49:3:17:so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
49:3:18:may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
49:3:19:and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
49:3:20:Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,
49:3:21:to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
49:4:1:As a prisoner for the Lord, I encourage you to live in a manner worthy of the calling you have received.
49:4:2:Be humble and gentle, patient with one another, and maintain unity through the bond of peace.
49:4:3:Eagerly strive to preserve the unity of the Spirit within the community of believers, bound together by peace.
49:4:4:There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call,
49:4:5:one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49:4:6:one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
49:4:7:To each of us, grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
49:4:8:For it is written, "When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts to people."
49:4:9:Now, this phrase "he ascended," what does it mean except that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
49:4:10:The one who descended is the same who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might fill all things.
49:4:11:And he gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,
49:4:12:for the equipping of the saints, for the work of ministry, and for building up the body of Christ,
49:4:13:until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, becoming mature and attaining the full stature of Christ.
49:4:14:We should no longer be children, tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, through the cunning and deceit of people who lie in wait to deceive.
49:4:15:Instead, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, Christ,
49:4:16:from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
49:4:17:So I say this, and testify in the Lord: You must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
49:4:18:They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.
49:4:19:Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality, greedily practicing every kind of impurity.
49:4:20:But that is not how you learned Christ!
49:4:21:If indeed you have heard him and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,
49:4:22:put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,
49:4:23:and be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
49:4:24:and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
49:4:25:Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak the truth with one another, for we are members of one another.
49:4:26:Be angry, but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
49:4:27:and give no opportunity to the devil.
49:4:28:Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
49:4:29:Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.
49:4:30:And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49:4:31:Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
49:4:32:Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ forgave you.
49:5:1:Imitate God, therefore, as dearly loved children,
49:5:2:and live a life of love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49:5:3:But sexual immorality, impurity, or greed should not even be mentioned among you, as is fitting for saints.
49:5:4:Obscene language, foolish talk, or crude joking are not appropriate; instead, express gratitude.
49:5:5:For know this with certainty: no immoral, impure, or greedy person—such a one is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
49:5:6:Do not let anyone deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
49:5:7:So do not become partners with them.
49:5:8:Once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light,
49:5:9:for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
49:5:10:Discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
49:5:11:Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
49:5:12:For it is shameful even to mention the things done by them in secret.
49:5:13:But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for the light makes everything clear.
49:5:14:Therefore, it is said: "Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49:5:15:Be careful how you live—not as unwise but as wise,
49:5:16:making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil.
49:5:17:So do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
49:5:18:Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless behavior. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,
49:5:19:speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord,
49:5:20:giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
49:5:21:submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49:5:22:Wives, submit to your own husbands as you do to the Lord,
49:5:23:for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
49:5:24:Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
49:5:25:Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
49:5:26:to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
49:5:27:and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
49:5:28:In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49:5:29:For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,
49:5:30:for we are members of his body.
49:5:31:"For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
49:5:32:This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.
49:5:33:Nevertheless, each one of you should also love his wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
49:6:1:Children, listen to your parents because this is the right thing to do.
49:6:2:Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
49:6:3:so that it may go well for you and you may enjoy a long life on earth.
49:6:4:Fathers, don't provoke your children to anger, but raise them with loving discipline and guidance.
49:6:5:Servants, obey your earthly masters with respect and sincerity, as if you were serving Christ,
49:6:6:not just when they are watching, but all the time, as if you were serving the Lord, not people.
49:6:7:Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord and not merely human beings,
49:6:8:knowing that whatever good anyone does, they will receive their reward from the Lord, whether they are slaves or free.
49:6:9:Masters, treat your servants in the same way. Don't threaten them, remembering that both you and they have a Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
49:6:10:Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
49:6:11:Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
49:6:12:For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, authorities, cosmic powers of darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in heavenly realms.
49:6:13:Therefore, put on every piece of God's armor so you can resist the enemy in times of evil and stand firm after everything is over.
49:6:14:Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, the breastplate of righteousness in place,
49:6:15:and your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
49:6:16:In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49:6:17:Put on the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49:6:18:Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and request. Stay alert and always keep praying for all the Lord's people.
49:6:19:Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given to me so that I can fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
49:6:20:for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
49:6:21:Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
49:6:22:I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us and that he may encourage your hearts.
49:6:23:Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49:6:24:Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
