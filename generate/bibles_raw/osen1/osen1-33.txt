33:1:1:The word of the LORD that came to Micah, a native of Moresheth, concerning Samaria and Jerusalem during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
33:1:2:Hear this, all you peoples; pay attention, earth and everyone in it! The Sovereign LORD will testify against you, the Lord from His holy temple.
33:1:3:Look, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling place; He will descend and tread on the high places of the earth.
33:1:4:The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.
33:1:5:All this is because of Jacob's rebellion and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the cause of Jacob's rebellion? Isn't it Samaria? And what is the source of the high places in Judah? Isn't it Jerusalem?
33:1:6:So I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and expose her foundations.
33:1:7:All her carved images will be smashed, and all her precious idols will be destroyed. I will strip her of the wealth she gained from the prostitution of her idolatry, and it will be carried off by foreigners.
33:1:8:Because of this, I will mourn and wail; I will walk barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl,
33:1:9:For her wounds are incurable, reaching even to Judah, extending to the gate of my people, all the way to Jerusalem.
33:1:10:Don't announce it in Gath or weep at all. In Beth-leaphrah, roll in the dust.
33:1:11:Pass by, you who live in Shaphir, naked and ashamed. The inhabitants of Zaanan will not come out. Beth-ezel mourns, for its protection is taken from you.
33:1:12:Those living in Maroth anxiously wait for relief, but disaster comes from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.
33:1:13:Hurry, you people of Lachish! You were the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
33:1:14:Therefore, give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
33:1:15:Again I will bring a conqueror against you, inhabitants of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will go to Adullam.
33:1:16:Shave your heads in mourning for the children you love; make yourselves as bald as an eagle, for they will be taken from you into exile.
33:2:1:Woe to those who devise wicked plans and work evil on their beds! When morning comes, they carry out their schemes because it is in their power to do so.
33:2:2:They covet fields and seize them; they take houses and oppress their owners, depriving a man of his inheritance.
33:2:3:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am planning disaster against this family, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.
33:2:4:In that day, people will mock you with a bitter lament, saying, "We are utterly ruined! The Lord has taken away our possessions and divided them among our enemies."
33:2:5:You will have no one to cast lots for land among the Lord's people.
33:2:6:"Do not prophesy," they say to the prophets. "Don't preach about these things; disgrace won't overtake us."
33:2:7:O descendants of Jacob, should it be said, "Does the Lord grow impatient? Does He do such things?" Do not my words bring good to those who walk uprightly?
33:2:8:But lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip the robe from the peaceful, unsuspecting passersby, as if returning from war.
33:2:9:You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.
33:2:10:Get up and leave, for this is not your resting place, because it is defiled and beyond redemption.
33:2:11:If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' that would be just the prophet for this people!
33:2:12:I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will bring together the remnant of Israel. I will assemble you like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.
33:2:13:The one who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the Lord at their head.
33:3:1:Listen, leaders of Israel! You should know what is right,
33:3:2:but you hate good and love evil. You tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones.
33:3:3:You devour my people's flesh, strip off their skin, and break their bones. You chop them up like meat for the pot, like flesh for the stew.
33:3:4:When trouble comes, they will cry out to the Lord, but He will not answer them. At that time, He will hide His face from them because of the evil they have done.
33:3:5:This is what the Lord says about the false prophets who lead my people astray: They promise peace when they have something to eat, but declare war against those who do not feed them.
33:3:6:Therefore, night will come without visions, and darkness without divination. The sun will set on these prophets, and the day will turn dark for them.
33:3:7:The seers will be ashamed, and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there will be no answer from God.
33:3:8:But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
33:3:9:Hear this, leaders of Jacob and rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort everything that is right,
33:3:10:building Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice.
33:3:11:Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they claim to rely on the Lord, saying, "Is not the Lord among us? No disaster will come upon us."
33:3:12:Because of this, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple hill will be covered with thickets.
33:4:1:In the last days, the mountain of the Lord's house will be established as the highest of the mountains, and it will be raised above the hills; all nations will flow to it.
33:4:2:Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." For the law will go out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
33:4:3:He will judge between many nations and settle disputes for numerous peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
33:4:4:Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree, with no one to make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken.
33:4:5:Though all the nations may follow their own gods, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.
33:4:6:"In that day," declares the Lord, "I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.
33:4:7:I will make the lame a remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
33:4:8:As for you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of Daughter Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem."
33:4:9:Now why do you cry aloud? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?
33:4:10:Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the Lord will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.
33:4:11:But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"
33:4:12:They do not know the thoughts of the Lord; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
33:4:13:"Arise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hooves of bronze, and you will break to pieces many nations." You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the Lord, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
33:5:1:In those days, Marshal your troops, O city of troops! A siege is laid against us, and they will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
33:5:2:But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, from you will come forth for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from ancient times, from days of old.
33:5:3:Therefore, God will give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth. Then the rest of his brothers will return to the people of Israel.
33:5:4:He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth.
33:5:5:And he will be our peace when Assyria invades our land and marches through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
33:5:6:They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and march across our borders.
33:5:7:The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on the help of man.
33:5:8:The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue.
33:5:9:Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed.
33:5:10:In that day, declares the Lord, I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots.
33:5:11:I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
33:5:12:I will destroy sorceries from your hands, and you will have no more fortune-tellers.
33:5:13:I will remove your idols and sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
33:5:14:I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles and demolish your cities.
33:5:15:I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me.
33:6:1:Listen to what the LORD says: "Stand up, plead your case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.
33:6:2:Hear, O mountains, the LORD's accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against His people; He is lodging a charge against Israel.
33:6:3:"My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.
33:6:4:I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.
33:6:5:My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD."
33:6:6:With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?
33:6:7:Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
33:6:8:He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
33:6:9:The voice of the LORD cries out to the city— and it is sound wisdom to fear Your name: "Hear, O tribe and assembly of the city!
33:6:10:Can I forget the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the short measure that is accursed?
33:6:11:Shall I acquit the dishonest scales, with the bag of deceitful weights?
33:6:12:For the rich men within it are full of violence, and its inhabitants have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
33:6:13:So I will punish you for your sins and make you suffer because of them.
33:6:14:You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword.
33:6:15:You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not use the oil, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.
33:6:16:You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house; you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations."
33:7:1:Woe is me! I have become like someone who gathers summer fruits, like one who picks grapes after the harvest; there's no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave.
33:7:2:The faithful have vanished from the earth, and there's no one upright among mankind; they all lie in wait for bloodshed, and each hunts his brother with a net.
33:7:3:Their hands are skilled at doing evil; rulers demand bribes, judges accept them, and powerful people dictate what they desire—thus they conspire together.
33:7:4:The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion.
33:7:5:Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace, guard the words of your lips.
33:7:6:For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a person's enemies are the members of their own household.
33:7:7:But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.
33:7:8:Rejoice not over me, my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light to me.
33:7:9:I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my cause and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light; I shall see His righteousness.
33:7:10:Then my enemy will see, and shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the Lord your God?" My eyes will gaze upon her; now she will be trampled like mud in the streets.
33:7:11:A day for building your walls will come! On that day, the boundary will be extended.
33:7:12:In that day they will come to you, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
33:7:13:But the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as a result of their deeds.
33:7:14:Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.
33:7:15:As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.
33:7:16:The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouths; their ears shall be deaf.
33:7:17:They shall lick the dust like a serpent, like the crawling things of the earth; they shall come trembling out of their strongholds; they shall turn in dread to the Lord our God, and they shall be in fear of you.
33:7:18:Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of His inheritance? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in steadfast love.
33:7:19:He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
33:7:20:You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
