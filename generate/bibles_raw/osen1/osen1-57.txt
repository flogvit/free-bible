57:1:1:Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,
57:1:2:to Apphia, our sister, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house:
57:1:3:May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
57:1:4:I always thank my God when I remember you in my prayers,
57:1:5:because I hear about your love and faith towards the Lord Jesus and all the saints.
57:1:6:I pray that your partnership in the faith may be effective in recognizing all the good we can do for Christ.
57:1:7:Your love has brought me great joy and encouragement, as the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.
57:1:8:So, although I could be bold in Christ and order you to do what is right,
57:1:9:I prefer to appeal to you out of love. I, Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ—
57:1:10:am pleading on behalf of Onesimus, who has become my spiritual son while I am in prison.
57:1:11:He used to be useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.
57:1:12:I am sending him back to you; he is like my own heart.
57:1:13:I would have liked to keep him with me, so he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
57:1:14:But I didn't want to do anything without your consent, so that your kindness wouldn't be forced but voluntary.
57:1:15:Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a short time, so you could have him back forever,
57:1:16:no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially dear to me, but even more so to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
57:1:17:So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57:1:18:If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
57:1:19:I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.
57:1:20:Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
57:1:21:Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than what I ask.
57:1:22:And one more thing—prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
57:1:23:Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
57:1:24:And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
57:1:25:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
