64:1:1:Dear friend Gaius, whom I truly love, I am writing this letter.
64:1:2:My greatest joy is to hear that my children are living according to the truth.
64:1:3:It brings me happiness to know that you are showing hospitality and helping the believers, even those you don't know.
64:1:4:I've heard about your love and faithfulness, and how you're supporting the missionaries so they can continue their work.
64:1:5:Your actions, dear friend, reflect your devotion to God and his people.
64:1:6:These missionaries have spoken highly of your love before the church. Please help them on their journey in a manner worthy of God.
64:1:7:They set out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from non-believers.
64:1:8:So, we should support such people, working together with them for the truth.
64:1:9:I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge, refuses to accept us.
64:1:10:If I come, I will call attention to his actionsâ€”spreading false accusations against us, not being content with that, he also refuses to welcome the brothers, and stops those who want to help them, expelling them from the church.
64:1:11:Beloved Gaius, do not imitate what is evil, but follow what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
64:1:12:Demetrius has a good reputation among everyone, and even the truth itself testifies on his behalf. We also vouch for him, and you know that our testimony is true.
64:1:13:I have much more to tell you, but I would rather not write it down.
64:1:14:I hope to see you soon, and we can talk face to face.
64:1:15:May peace be with you. Your friends here send their greetings. Greet each of our friends there by name.
