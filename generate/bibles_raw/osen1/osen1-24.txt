24:1:1:In the year 627 BC, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, one of the priests living in Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin.
24:1:2:The Lord spoke to Jeremiah during the reign of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, and continued speaking to him through the reigns of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, and Zedekiah, son of Josiah, until the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile in the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign.
24:1:3:The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
24:1:4:"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I set you apart as a prophet to the nations."
24:1:5:I replied, "Ah, Sovereign Lord! I don't know how to speak, for I am only a youth."
24:1:6:But the Lord said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth,' for you will go to everyone I send you to, and you will speak whatever I command you.
24:1:7:Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will protect you," declares the Lord.
24:1:8:Then the Lord reached out his hand, touched my mouth, and told me, "I have put my words in your mouth.
24:1:9:Today, I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant."
24:1:10:Next, the word of the Lord came to me, asking, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" I answered, "I see the branch of an almond tree."
24:1:11:The Lord said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I am watching over my word to fulfill it."
24:1:12:Again, the word of the Lord came to me, asking, "What do you see now?" I replied, "I see a boiling pot, tilting away from the north."
24:1:13:Then the Lord explained, "From the north, disaster will be poured out on all who live in this land.
24:1:14:I am summoning all the kingdoms of the north," declares the Lord. "Their kings will come and set up their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other towns of Judah.
24:1:15:I will pronounce judgment on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, burning incense to other gods, and worshiping what their hands have made.
24:1:16:As for you, Jeremiah, brace yourself and stand up; speak to them everything that I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them.
24:1:17:Today, I make you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
24:1:18:They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will protect you," declares the Lord.
24:2:1:God's word came to me, saying,
24:2:2:"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'This is what the Lord says: I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, through a land not sown.
24:2:3:Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster came upon them,'" declares the Lord.
24:2:4:Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel.
24:2:5:This is what the Lord says: "What fault did your ancestors find in me that they strayed so far from me, following worthless idols and becoming worthless themselves?
24:2:6:They didn't ask, 'Where is the Lord who brought us out of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, through a land of drought and deep darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?'
24:2:7:I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and enjoy its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.
24:2:8:The priests didn't ask, 'Where is the Lord?' Those who handled the law didn't know me; the rulers rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, following useless idols.
24:2:9:So I will bring charges against you again," declares the Lord, "and I will bring charges against your children's children.
24:2:10:Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and see; send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:
24:2:11:Has a nation ever changed its gods, even though they are not really gods? But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols.
24:2:12:Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great horror," declares the Lord.
24:2:13:"My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
24:2:14:Is Israel a slave by birth? Why has he become plunder?
24:2:15:Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.
24:2:16:Also, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull.
24:2:17:Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the Lord your God when he led you in the way?
24:2:18:Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates?
24:2:19:Your wickedness will punish you, and your apostasies will convict you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the Lord your God; the fear of me is not in you," declares the Lord, the God of hosts.
24:2:20:"Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, 'I will not serve you!' Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.
24:2:21:I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?
24:2:22:Even if you wash with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me," declares the Sovereign Lord.
24:2:23:"How can you say, 'I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals'? Look at your behavior in the valley; consider what you have done. You are a swift she-camel running here and there,
24:2:24:a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving - in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her.
24:2:25:Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, 'It's no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.'
24:2:26:"As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced - they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets.
24:2:27:They say to wood, 'You are my father,' and to stone, 'You gave me birth.' They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, 'Come and save us!'
24:2:28:Where are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns.
24:2:29:"Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me," declares the Lord.
24:2:30:In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.
24:2:31:You of this generation, consider the word of the Lord: "Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, 'We are free to roam; we will come to you no more'?
24:2:32:Does a young woman forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.
24:2:33:How skillfully you pursue love! Even the most wicked women can learn from your ways.
24:2:34:On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this,
24:2:35:you say, 'I am innocent; he is not angry with me.' But I will pass judgment on you because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
24:2:36:Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.
24:2:37:You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the Lord has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them."
24:3:1:In those days, Israel was unfaithful, and I said to her, "Return, faithless Israel," declares the Lord. "I won't stay angry with you forever, because I am merciful."
24:3:2:"Only admit your guilt, that you have rebelled against the Lord your God, and have been unfaithful by worshiping foreign gods under every green tree, and have not obeyed my voice," says the Lord.
24:3:3:"Return, O rebellious children," declares the Lord, "for I am your master. I will bring you back, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion."
24:3:4:"I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will guide you with knowledge and understanding."
24:3:5:"In those days, when your numbers have increased in the land," declares the Lord, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made."
24:3:6:"At that time Jerusalem will be called The Throne of the Lord, and all nations will gather there to honor the name of the Lord at Jerusalem, and they will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts."
24:3:7:"In those days, the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land that I gave your ancestors as an inheritance."
24:3:8:"I had thought how I would set you among my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation. And I thought you would call me 'My Father' and not turn away from following me."
24:3:9:But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me," declares the Lord.
24:3:10:A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God.
24:3:11:"Return, faithless people," declares the Lord, "for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion."
24:3:12:"Then, when you return, I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding."
24:3:13:"In those days, when your numbers have increased in the land," declares the Lord, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made."
24:3:14:"At that time Jerusalem will be called The Throne of the Lord, and all nations will gather there to honor the name of the Lord at Jerusalem, and they will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts."
24:3:15:"In those days, the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land that I gave your ancestors as an inheritance."
24:3:16:"I had thought how I would set you among my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation. And I thought you would call me 'My Father' and not turn away from following me."
24:3:17:But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me," declares the Lord.
24:3:18:A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God.
24:3:19:"Return, faithless people," declares the Lord, "for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion."
24:3:20:"Then, when you return, I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding."
24:3:21:"In those days, when your numbers have increased in the land," declares the Lord, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the Lord.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made."
24:3:22:"At that time Jerusalem will be called The Throne of the Lord, and all nations will gather there to honor the name of the Lord at Jerusalem, and they will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts."
24:3:23:"In those days, the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your ancestors as an inheritance."
24:3:24:I asked myself, "How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation. I thought you would call me 'Father' and not turn away from following me."
24:3:25:But like a wife who betrays her husband, you have betrayed me, O house of Israel," declares the Lord.
24:4:1:If you, Israel, want to return to me," declares the Lord, "remove your detestable idols and don't stray from me.
24:4:2:And if you swear by my name, 'As the Lord lives,' with truth, justice, and righteousness, then the nations will be blessed by you and take pride in you."
24:4:3:This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your unplowed ground, and do not sow among thorns.
24:4:4:Circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or else my wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to put it out, because of the evil you have done.
24:4:5:Announce this in Judah and proclaim it in Jerusalem: Sound the trumpet through the land; cry out loudly and say, 'Assemble and let us flee to the fortified cities!'
24:4:6:Set up a signal toward Zion; seek refuge without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, and great destruction.
24:4:7:A lion has come out of its lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste to your land. Your cities will lie in ruins without any inhabitants.
24:4:8:So put on sackcloth, mourn and wail, for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned away from us."
24:4:9:On that day, declares the Lord, the king and the officials will lose their courage, the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled.
24:4:10:Then I said, "Ah, Sovereign Lord! You have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, 'You will have peace,' when the sword is at our throats."
24:4:11:At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse.
24:4:12:A wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them."
24:4:13:Look! He advances like the clouds, his chariots like a whirlwind, his horses swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined!
24:4:14:Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart so you may be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?
24:4:15:A voice announces from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.
24:4:16:Tell this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem: "Besiegers come from a distant land; they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
24:4:17:They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against me," declares the Lord.
24:4:18:"Your own conduct and actions have brought this upon you. This is your punishment. It is bitter! It pierces to the heart!"
24:4:19:My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the pain in my chest! My heart pounds within me; I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet; I have heard the battle cry.
24:4:20:Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant, my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment.
24:4:21:How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
24:4:22:"My people are foolish; they do not know me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but they do not know how to do good."
24:4:23:I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone.
24:4:24:I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.
24:4:25:I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away.
24:4:26:I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the Lord, before his fierce anger.
24:4:27:For this is what the Lord says: "The whole land will be desolate, but I will not destroy it completely.
24:4:28:Because of this, the earth will mourn, and the heavens above will grow dark. I have spoken, I have planned, and I will not relent or turn back."
24:4:29:At the sound of horsemen and archers, every town takes flight. Some go into the thickets; some climb up among the rocks. All the towns are abandoned; no one lives in them.
24:4:30:What are you doing, you devastated one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why highlight your eyes with makeup? You adorn yourself in vain. Your lovers despise you; they want to take your life.
24:4:31:I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a groan as of one bearing her first child—the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, "Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers."
24:5:1:Look around the streets of Jerusalem; see for yourselves and learn. Search her squares to find even one person who does what is right and seeks the truth, and I will forgive this city.
24:5:2:Even though they say, "As the Lord lives," they are swearing falsely.
24:5:3:Lord, don't your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they didn't feel it. You crushed them, but they refused to be corrected. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to turn back.
24:5:4:Then I thought, "These are just the poor; they lack understanding because they haven't learned the way of the Lord or the requirements of their God.
24:5:5:I'll go to the leaders and speak with them, for they must know the way of the Lord and the requirements of their God." But they, too, had broken the yoke and torn off the chains.
24:5:6:So a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, and a leopard will lurk near their towns, tearing apart anyone who dares to venture out. For their rebelliousness is great, and their unfaithfulness is countless.
24:5:7:Why should I forgive you? Your children have abandoned me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and gathered at the houses of prostitutes.
24:5:8:They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man's wife.
24:5:9:Shouldn't I punish them for this? Shouldn't I take revenge on such a nation?
24:5:10:Go through her vineyards and destroy them, but do not completely uproot them. Strip away her branches, for they do not belong to the Lord.
24:5:11:The people of Israel and Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me," declares the Lord.
24:5:12:They have lied about the Lord; they said, "He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine."
24:5:13:The prophets are but wind, and the word is not in them. So let their own words be done to them!"
24:5:14:Because of this, the Lord God Almighty says: "I will make my words a fire in your mouth, and these people the wood it consumes.
24:5:15:Listen, I am bringing a distant nation against you, people of Israel," declares the Lord. "It is an enduring nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.
24:5:16:Their quivers are like open graves; they are all mighty warriors.
24:5:17:They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword, they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust.
24:5:18:Yet even in those days," declares the Lord, "I will not completely destroy you.
24:5:19:And when the people ask, 'Why has the Lord our God done all this to us?' you will tell them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.'
24:5:20:Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:
24:5:21:Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:
24:5:22:Do you not fear me? Do you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it.
24:5:23:But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away.
24:5:24:They do not say to themselves, 'Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.'
24:5:25:Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good.
24:5:26:Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like hunters hiding in ambush. They set traps to catch their fellow humans.
24:5:27:Like a cage full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful
24:5:28:and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not promote the case of the fatherless; they do not defend the rights of the poor.
24:5:29:Shouldn't I punish them for this? Shouldn't I take revenge on such a nation?
24:5:30:A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land:
24:5:31:The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?
24:6:1:Hear the word of the Lord, O people of Israel! Pass this message to Jerusalem: Sound the alarm from the watchtowers; call out a warning!
24:6:2:There's danger approaching from the north, a great disaster looms over the city.
24:6:3:To her strong guards and warriors, she appears like a beautiful woman, but they are about to be attacked by enemy forces.
24:6:4:Prepare for battle, you defenders of the city! We must fight, for the day of destruction is upon us.
24:6:5:Jerusalem, your doom is near; it is time to face the consequences of your actions.
24:6:6:This is what the Lord Almighty says: Cut down trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. She is a city full of oppression and wickedness.
24:6:7:As a well pours forth its water, so does Jerusalem overflow with evil. Violence and destruction echo within her walls; pain and suffering are always present.
24:6:8:Jerusalem, take heed and correct your ways, lest my wrath burn against you and I bring destruction upon you.
24:6:9:This is what the Lord Almighty declares: The remnant of Israel will be gleaned like a vineyard; every last grape will be picked clean.
24:6:10:To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed, and they cannot hear. They have rejected the word of the Lord, and they have no desire for it.
24:6:11:I am filled with the wrath of the Lord, and I can no longer hold it back. Pour it out on the children in the streets and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife shall be taken, the old and the very young.
24:6:12:Their houses will be given to others, along with their fields and wives, for I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land, declares the Lord.
24:6:13:From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike deceive and deal falsely.
24:6:14:They treat the wounds of my people lightly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
24:6:15:Are they not ashamed of their detestable conduct? They have no sense of shame; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they will collapse, says the Lord.
24:6:16:This is what the Lord says: Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, where the good way lies, and walk in it. You will find rest for your souls. But you said, "We will not walk in it."
24:6:17:I appointed watchmen over you and said, "Listen for the sound of the trumpet!" But you replied, "We will not listen."
24:6:18:Therefore, hear, O nations; observe, O witnesses, what will happen to them.
24:6:19:Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have ignored my words and rejected my law.
24:6:20:What use is frankincense from Sheba or sweet cane from distant lands to me? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me.
24:6:21:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I will put obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish.
24:6:22:This is what the Lord says: Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24:6:23:They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea as they ride on horses, arrayed like men for battle against you, O Daughter of Zion.
24:6:24:We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24:6:25:Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side.
24:6:26:Put on sackcloth, O my people, and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
24:6:27:I have made you a tester of metals among my people, so you may know and test their ways.
24:6:28:They are all hardened rebels, going about with slander. They are bronze and iron; all of them act corruptly.
24:6:29:The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out.
24:6:30:They are called rejected silver, because the Lord has rejected them.
24:7:1:God's message came to Jeremiah, saying,
24:7:2:"Stand in the entrance of the Lord's house and proclaim these words: 'Listen to the Lord's message, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord.
24:7:3:This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Change your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place.
24:7:4:Don't trust deceptive words, thinking, 'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.'
24:7:5:If you genuinely change your ways and actions, treating each other fairly,
24:7:6:not oppressing foreigners, orphans, and widows, not shedding innocent blood in this place, and not following other gods to your own harm,
24:7:7:then I will let you live in this land, in the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever.
24:7:8:But look, you are trusting deceptive words that are useless.
24:7:9:Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods you don't know,
24:7:10:and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, 'We are safe,' only to continue doing all these detestable things?
24:7:11:Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? I have seen it myself, declares the Lord.
24:7:12:Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
24:7:13:While you were doing all these things, I spoke to you again and again, but you didn't listen. I called you, but you didn't answer.
24:7:14:So just as I did to Shiloh, I will do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors.
24:7:15:I will cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your fellow Israelites, the whole family of Ephraim.
24:7:16:As for you, don't pray for these people, don't cry or plead for them, for I won't listen when they call to me in their time of distress.
24:7:17:What right do my beloved people have to be in my house when they carry out so many evil schemes? Can vows and sacred meat prevent your punishment? Then you can rejoice.
24:7:18:The Lord says, 'Remember what happened at Shiloh, where I established my dwelling before I chose Jerusalem.
24:7:19:But my people didn't listen to me or pay attention; they became stubborn and did more evil than their ancestors.'
24:7:20:So this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'I will bring disaster upon them, and they won't escape. When they cry out to me, I won't listen.
24:7:21:Offer as many burnt offerings and sacrifices as you want, but I won't be pleased with them, for I will destroy this people.
24:7:22:When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I didn't command them about burnt offerings and sacrifices.
24:7:23:Instead, I told them this: Obey me, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Walk in the ways I command you, so that it may go well with you.
24:7:24:But they didn't listen or pay attention; instead, they followed their own stubborn hearts and went after other gods, serving and worshiping them. They became just like their ancestors.'
24:7:25:From the day your ancestors left Egypt until today, I have sent my servants, the prophets, to you again and again.
24:7:26:But they didn't listen to me or pay attention. They were stubborn and did more evil than their ancestors.
24:7:27:When you tell them all this, they won't listen to you either. When you call to them, they won't answer you.
24:7:28:Say to them, 'This is the nation that has not obeyed the Lord its God and has not accepted correction. Truth has vanished; it is no longer heard from their mouths.
24:7:29:Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the Lord has rejected and abandoned this generation that has provoked his wrath.'
24:7:30:The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the Lord. They have set up detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it.
24:7:31:They have built high places at Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, something I never commanded, nor did it enter my mind.
24:7:32:So beware, for the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
24:7:33:The corpses of this people will become food for the birds and wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
24:7:34:I will silence the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
24:8:1:At that time," says the Lord, "the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be taken out of their graves.
24:8:2:They will be exposed to the sun, moon, and all the stars in the sky, which they loved and served, followed, consulted, and worshipped. Their bones won't be gathered or buried but will become like dung on the surface of the ground.
24:8:3:Death will be preferable to life for those who remain of this evil family, in every place where I have driven them," declares the Lord of Hosts.
24:8:4:"You must say to them, 'This is what the Lord says: When people fall, do they not get up again? If someone turns away, does he not return?
24:8:5:Why then has this people, Jerusalem, turned away in perpetual backsliding? They cling to deceit and refuse to return.
24:8:6:I listened attentively, but they did not speak the truth. No one repents of his wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone keeps going in their own direction, like a horse charging into battle.
24:8:7:Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, swift, and thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the Lord.
24:8:8:How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us'? Look, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.
24:8:9:The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord, what wisdom do they really have?
24:8:10:So I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, they all practice deceit.
24:8:11:They treat the wound of my people carelessly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.
24:8:12:Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they don't even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they will collapse," says the Lord.
24:8:13:"I will take away their harvest, declares the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the tree, and the leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken away."
24:8:14:Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the Lord our God has doomed us and given us poisoned water to drink because we have sinned against him.
24:8:15:We hoped for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but only terror.
24:8:16:The snorting of the enemy's horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their stallions, the whole land trembles. They come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there.
24:8:17:See, I am sending venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you," declares the Lord.
24:8:18:My grief is beyond healing; my heart is broken within me.
24:8:19:Listen to the cry of my people from a distant land: "Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?" Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and worthless foreign gods?
24:8:20:The harvest has passed, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.
24:8:21:Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me.
24:8:22:Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?
24:9:1:In this time, people should weep and wail for the mountains and lament for the pastures of the wilderness, because they are laid waste and deserted.
24:9:2:No one passes through them anymore; they can't hear the sound of cattle. Birds and wild animals have fled, leaving the land empty.
24:9:3:I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a den of jackals, and reduce the cities of Judah to desolation without inhabitants.
24:9:4:Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has the Lord spoken, so they may explain it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a desert where no one lives?
24:9:5:It's because the people have forsaken my law, which I set before them. They haven't obeyed me or followed my teachings.
24:9:6:Instead, they've been led astray by the stubbornness of their hearts and followed after other gods, serving and worshiping them.
24:9:7:So this is what the Lord of Hosts says: I will refine and test them in the fire, for how else should I deal with the wickedness of my people?
24:9:8:Their tongues are like deadly arrows; they speak deceitfully. They exchange friendly words with their neighbors, but in their hearts, they plan to harm them.
24:9:9:Should I not punish them for this? declares the Lord. Should I not take revenge on such a nation as this?
24:9:10:I will weep and wail for the mountains and mourn for the pastures of the wilderness, for they have been burned up, and no one travels through them. The sound of livestock is gone; birds and beasts have fled and disappeared.
24:9:11:And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt for jackals; and the cities of Judah will be desolate, without inhabitants.
24:9:12:Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert where no one lives?
24:9:13:The Lord said, "It's because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them. They haven't obeyed me or followed my teachings.
24:9:14:Instead, they've been led astray by the stubbornness of their hearts and followed after other gods, serving and worshiping them.
24:9:15:So this is what the Lord of Hosts says: I will feed them with bitterness and give them poisoned water to drink.
24:9:16:I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will send the sword after them until they are destroyed."
24:9:17:This is what the Lord of Hosts says: "Pay attention! Call the mourning women to come; send for the most skillful of them.
24:9:18:Let them quickly begin their weeping for us, so that our eyes may overflow with tears and streams of water pour from our eyelids.
24:9:19:For the sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How devastated we are! How utterly ashamed! We must leave our land because our homes have been torn down.'"
24:9:20:Now, you women, hear the word of the Lord; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters to wail, and teach one another a lament.
24:9:21:Death has climbed in through our windows and entered our fortresses, cutting off the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.
24:9:22:Speak! This is what the Lord declares: "The dead bodies of people will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them."
24:9:23:This is what the Lord says: "Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches,
24:9:24:but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight," declares the Lord.
24:10:1:Listen to the message that the Lord has for you, people of Israel.
24:10:2:This is what the Lord says: Do not follow the ways of other nations or be terrified by the signs in the sky, even though they are afraid of them.
24:10:3:The customs of those nations are worthless; they cut a tree from the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.
24:10:4:They decorate it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it won't fall over.
24:10:5:These idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field; they cannot speak or move. They must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them, for they can do no harm, nor can they do any good.
24:10:6:No one is like you, Lord; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.
24:10:7:Who would not fear you, King of the nations? This is your due, for among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.
24:10:8:They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols.
24:10:9:Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. These materials are crafted by skilled workers and fashioned by the hands of goldsmiths. They dress their idols in blue and purple clothing made by expert weavers.
24:10:10:But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath.
24:10:11:Tell them this: "The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
24:10:12:God made the earth by his power; he established the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24:10:13:When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
24:10:14:Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
24:10:15:They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.
24:10:16:The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the people of his inheritance—the Lord Almighty is his name.
24:10:17:Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege.
24:10:18:For this is what the Lord says: "At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured."
24:10:19:Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, "This is my sickness, and I must endure it."
24:10:20:My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.
24:10:21:The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the Lord; so they do not prosper, and all their flock is scattered.
24:10:22:Listen! The report is coming—a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the cities of Judah desolate, a haunt for jackals.
24:10:23:Lord, I know that people's lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps.
24:10:24:Discipline me, Lord, but only in due measure—not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing.
24:10:25:Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have consumed him completely and destroyed his homeland.
24:11:1:This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24:11:2:"Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24:11:3:Tell them that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant—
24:11:4:the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.' I said, 'Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God.
24:11:5:Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey—the land you possess today.'" I answered, "Amen, Lord."
24:11:6:The Lord said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: 'Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them.
24:11:7:From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, "Obey me."
24:11:8:But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant that I commanded them to follow but they did not.'"
24:11:9:Then the Lord said to me, "There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem.
24:11:10:They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors.
24:11:11:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.
24:11:12:The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but those gods will not save them at all when disaster strikes.
24:11:13:You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.'
24:11:14:"Do not pray for these people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.
24:11:15:What is my beloved doing in my temple as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment? When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice."
24:11:16:The Lord called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire, and its branches will be broken.
24:11:17:The Lord Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.
24:11:18:Because the Lord revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing.
24:11:19:I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more."
24:11:20:But you, Lord Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24:11:21:Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord or you will die by our hands"—
24:11:22:this is what the Lord Almighty says: "I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine.
24:11:23:Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment."
24:12:1:Lord, you are always right when I bring a case before you. Yet, I want to discuss something with you about your justice: Why do the wicked prosper? Why do treacherous people enjoy peace?
24:12:2:You planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips, but far from their hearts.
24:12:3:Yet you, Lord, know me; you see me and test my heart toward you. Drag them away like sheep for slaughter, and set them apart for the day of doom.
24:12:4:How long will the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither? The animals and birds are dying because of the evil in the land. For the people say, "God doesn't see what we're doing."
24:12:5:"If you've raced with people on foot and they've worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, what will you do in the thickets by the Jordan?
24:12:6:Even your relatives, members of your own family, have betrayed you; they've joined the rebellion against you. Do not trust them, even though they speak kindly to you.
24:12:7:I have abandoned my house; I have deserted my inheritance. I have handed over the one I love into the hands of her enemies.
24:12:8:My chosen people have turned against me; they roar at me like a lion. Because of this, I now hate them.
24:12:9:Is my chosen nation a speckled bird of prey that other birds surround and attack? Go, gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour her.
24:12:10:Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, trampling down my land, turning my pleasant land into a desolate wasteland.
24:12:11:They've made it a desolation; it mourns to me, utterly ruined. The whole land is laid waste because no one takes it to heart.
24:12:12:Destroyers have come upon all the barren heights in the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land to the other. No flesh has peace.
24:12:13:They've sown wheat but reaped thorns; they've exhausted themselves but gained nothing. So bear the shame of your harvest because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
24:12:14:This is what the Lord says: "As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave to my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands, and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them.
24:12:15:But after I uproot them, I will have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country.
24:12:16:And if they learn the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, 'As surely as the Lord lives,' just as they once taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be established among my people.
24:12:17:But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it," declares the Lord.
24:13:1:In this way, the LORD told me, "Go and buy a linen waistband and put it around your waist. Don't let it get wet."
24:13:2:So I purchased the waistband as the LORD instructed and wore it around my waist.
24:13:3:Then the word of the LORD came to me again, saying,
24:13:4:"Take the waistband you bought and are wearing, and go now to the Euphrates River and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks."
24:13:5:I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
24:13:6:After some time had passed, the LORD said to me, "Go back to the Euphrates and retrieve the waistband I told you to hide there."
24:13:7:So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the waistband from where I had hidden it. But now it was ruined and completely useless.
24:13:8:Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24:13:9:"This is what the LORD says: In the same way, I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
24:13:10:These wicked people refuse to listen to my words; they stubbornly follow their own desires and chase after other gods to worship and serve them. They will become like this waistband—completely useless.
24:13:11:For just as a waistband clings to a person's waist, so I intended for the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me," declares the LORD, "to be my people, for my renown, praise, and glory—but they would not listen.
24:13:12:So you are to say this word to them: 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every jar should be filled with wine.'" And they will reply, "Don't we already know that every jar should be filled with wine?"
24:13:13:Then tell them, "This is what the LORD says: I am about to fill all who live in this land with drunkenness—the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem.
24:13:14:I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike," declares the LORD. "I will not show pity or compassion or have any mercy on them when I destroy them."
24:13:15:Hear and pay attention; do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken.
24:13:16:Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he turns it into deep shadows and makes it utter darkness.
24:13:17:But if you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the LORD's flock will be taken captive.
24:13:18:Say to the king and to the queen mother, "Take a lowly seat, for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads."
24:13:19:The cities of the Negev will be shut up, with no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away.
24:13:20:Lift up your eyes and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted?
24:13:21:What will you say when the LORD sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor?
24:13:22:And if you ask yourself, "Why has this happened to me?" it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated.
24:13:23:Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
24:13:24:I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind.
24:13:25:This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you," declares the LORD, "because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods.
24:13:26:I myself will lift your skirts over your face, exposing your shame to all.
24:13:27:I have seen your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution. I have heard your cries on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?"
24:14:1:In that time, a severe drought struck Judah, and the gates of Jerusalem mourned and withered.
24:14:2:Their nobles sent their servants for water; they went to the cisterns but found no water. They returned with empty jars, ashamed and defeated.
24:14:3:Because of the drought, the farmers were distressed, and they covered their heads in despair.
24:14:4:The ground was cracked due to lack of rain, and the farmers were filled with anxiety.
24:14:5:Even the doe in the field abandoned her newborn fawn because there was no grass.
24:14:6:Wild donkeys stood on barren heights, gasping for breath like jackals; their eyesight failed because there was no vegetation.
24:14:7:Although our sins testify against us, Lord, please act for your name's sake. Indeed, our rebellions are many, and we have sinned against you.
24:14:8:You are the hope of Israel, its Savior in times of trouble. Why are you like a stranger in the land, or like a traveler who stays only for a night?
24:14:9:Why do you seem like a helpless man, like a warrior unable to save? Yet you, O Lord, are among us, and we are called by your name. Do not abandon us!
24:14:10:This is what the Lord says about these people: "They love to wander; they have not restrained their feet. So I will no longer accept them. I will now remember their wickedness and punish their sins."
24:14:11:Then the Lord said to me, "Do not pray for the welfare of these people.
24:14:12:Even if they fast, I will not listen to their cries. And if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will put an end to them by war, famine, and disease."
24:14:13:But I said, "Ah, Sovereign Lord! The prophets are telling them, 'You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.'"
24:14:14:The Lord replied, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them, commanded them, or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries, and the delusions of their own minds.
24:14:15:Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the prophets who prophesy in my name, though I did not send them, and who say, 'No sword or famine will touch this land': By sword and famine, those prophets will meet their end!
24:14:16:The people to whom they prophesy will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one left to bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters. I will pour out their wickedness upon them.
24:14:17:And you, Jeremiah, must tell them this: 'My eyes overflow with tears day and night without ceasing, for the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed by a mighty blow, a severely grievous wound.
24:14:18:If I go into the countryside, I see those slain by the sword; if I enter the city, I see the anguish of famine. Both prophet and priest roam the land, but they have no knowledge.'"
24:14:19:Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you despise Zion? Why have you struck us down so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace, but there is no good; we waited for a time of healing, but terror came instead.
24:14:20:We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord, and the guilt of our ancestors. We have indeed sinned against you.
24:14:21:For the sake of your name, do not despise us; do not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember your covenant with us, and do not break it.
24:14:22:Can any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Can the skies themselves send showers? Is it not you, O Lord our God? We put our hope in you, for you are the one who does all this.
24:15:1:At that time, the Lord said to me, "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!
24:15:2:And if they ask you, 'Where should we go?' tell them, 'This is what the Lord says: Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.'
24:15:3:I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the Lord: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
24:15:4:I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
24:15:5:Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are?
24:15:6:You have rejected me, declares the Lord. You keep going backward. So I will stretch out my hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of holding back.
24:15:7:I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they have not changed their ways.
24:15:8:Their widows will be more numerous before me than the sands of the seas. I will bring against them a destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down upon them anguish and terror.
24:15:9:The mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath; her sun has set while it is still day. She has been disgraced and humiliated. And the rest of them I will give over to the sword before their enemies, declares the Lord.
24:15:10:Woe to me, my mother, that you gave birth to me! A man of strife and conflict to the whole land! I have not lent or borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
24:15:11:The Lord said, "Surely I will set you free for purposes of good; surely I will intercede for you with the enemy in times of trouble and times of distress.
24:15:12:Can anyone break iron, iron from the north, or bronze?
24:15:13:Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country.
24:15:14:I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger is like a fire that will burn against you."
24:15:15:You know, O Lord; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering—do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.
24:15:16:When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight, for I bear your name, O Lord God Almighty.
24:15:17:I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation.
24:15:18:Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails?
24:15:19:Therefore this is what the Lord says: "If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them.
24:15:20:I will make you a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save and rescue you, declares the Lord.
24:15:21:I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel."
24:16:1:God told me, "Don't get married or have children in this place."
24:16:2:"Because this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born here, and about their mothers who give birth to them and their fathers who fathered them in this land:
24:16:3:They will die of terrible diseases. No one will mourn for them or bury them; they will be like dung on the ground. They will be killed by sword and famine, and their bodies will be food for birds and wild animals.
24:16:4:Moreover, I will make them an object of horror and trouble to all the kingdoms of the earth, due to Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and what he did in Jerusalem.
24:16:5:This is what the Lord says: 'Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have taken away my peace, love, and compassion from these people,' declares the Lord.
24:16:6:Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their heads for them.
24:16:7:No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead, nor will anyone give them a drink to console them for the loss of their father or mother.
24:16:8:Do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
24:16:9:For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Before your very eyes and in your days, I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.'
24:16:10:When you tell these people all this and they ask you, 'Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the Lord our God?'
24:16:11:Then say to them, 'It is because your ancestors forsook me,' declares the Lord, 'and followed other gods, served and worshiped them. They abandoned me and did not keep my law.
24:16:12:But you have behaved even worse than your ancestors. You follow the stubbornness of your own evil hearts instead of obeying me.
24:16:13:So I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.'
24:16:14:However, the days are coming," declares the Lord, "when it will no longer be said, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,'
24:16:15:but rather, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.
24:16:16:Look, I am sending for many fishermen," declares the Lord, "and they will catch them. After that, I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks.
24:16:17:My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes.
24:16:18:I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols."
24:16:19:Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in times of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say, "Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good.
24:16:20:Do people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!"
24:16:21:Therefore I will teach them—this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the Lord.
24:17:1:The sins of Judah are engraved with an iron pen; they are inscribed with a diamond point on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.
24:17:2:Their children remember their altars and Asherah poles, beside every green tree and on the high hills.
24:17:3:My mountain in the countryside, your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, because of the sin of your high places within your borders.
24:17:4:You will lose the inheritance I gave you; I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever.
24:17:5:Cursed is the one who trusts in humans, relying on mere flesh for strength, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
24:17:6:They will be like a shrub in the desert, not experiencing prosperity when it comes; dwelling in parched places, a salt land where no one lives.
24:17:7:Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him alone.
24:17:8:They will be like a tree planted by water, sending out roots by the stream. They won't fear when heat comes, and their leaves will stay green. In times of drought, they won't worry, and they'll never stop bearing fruit.
24:17:9:The human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who can truly understand it?
24:17:10:I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, based on what their deeds deserve.
24:17:11:Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay, so is the one who gains riches dishonestly; in the middle of their days, they will lose them, and in the end, they will be exposed as fools.
24:17:12:A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
24:17:13:Lord, you are the hope of Israel; all who abandon you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water.
24:17:14:Heal me, O Lord, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for you are my praise.
24:17:15:Look, they keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come now!"
24:17:16:But I haven't run away from being your shepherd; you know I haven't desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you.
24:17:17:Do not become a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
24:17:18:Let my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but do not terrify me. Bring the day of disaster upon them, and destroy them with double destruction.
24:17:19:This is what the Lord said to me: "Go and stand at the Gate of the People, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave, and also at all the other gates of Jerusalem."
24:17:20:Say to them, 'Listen to the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah, all people of Judah, and everyone living in Jerusalem who enters these gates.
24:17:21:This is what the Lord says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem.
24:17:22:Do not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors.
24:17:23:They did not listen or pay attention; they were stubborn and would not listen or accept discipline.
24:17:24:But if you are careful to obey me, declares the Lord, and carry no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, keeping the Sabbath day holy and not doing any work on it,
24:17:25:then kings and officials who sit on David's throne will come through the gates of this city with their chariots and horses, accompanied by the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. And this city will be inhabited forever.
24:17:26:People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the western foothills, from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, incense, and thanksgiving offerings to the house of the Lord.
24:17:27:But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in its gates. It will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem and will not be extinguished."
24:18:1:At that time, the Lord said to Jeremiah,
24:18:2:"Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message."
24:18:3:So I went to the potter's house, and saw him working at the wheel.
24:18:4:But the pot he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hands; so he formed it into another pot, as it seemed best to him.
24:18:5:Then the Lord's word came to me:
24:18:6:"Can't I do with you, Israel, as this potter does?" declares the Lord. "Just like clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, Israel.
24:18:7:If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed,
24:18:8:and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.
24:18:9:And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom will be built up and planted,
24:18:10:but it does evil in my sight and doesn't obey me, then I will reconsider the good I intended for it.
24:18:11:Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the Lord says: Look, I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your actions.'
24:18:12:But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will continue with our own plans; each of us will follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.'"
24:18:13:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "Ask among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel.
24:18:14:Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters flowing from afar ever run dry?
24:18:15:Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths. They made them walk in bypaths, on roads not built up.
24:18:16:Their land will be an object of horror and of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and shake their heads.
24:18:17:Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster."
24:18:18:Then they said, "Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says."
24:18:19:Listen to me, Lord; hear what my accusers are saying!
24:18:20:Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them.
24:18:21:So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle.
24:18:22:Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and hidden snares for my feet.
24:18:23:But you, Lord, know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
24:19:1:This is what the LORD says: "Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests with you.
24:19:2:Then go out to the valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There, proclaim the words I will tell you.
24:19:3:Say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to bring disaster upon this place that will make everyone's ears tingle.
24:19:4:Because they have abandoned me and made this place foreign by burning incense to other gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent,
24:19:5:they have built high places for Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I never commanded or even thought of.
24:19:6:So beware, for a time is coming," declares the LORD, "when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24:19:7:I will break the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who seek their lives. I will give their corpses as food for the birds and wild animals.
24:19:8:I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
24:19:9:I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh during the stress of the siege imposed on them by their enemies who seek their lives.'
24:19:10:Then you are to break the jar in the presence of those who went with you,
24:19:11:and say to them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter's jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
24:19:12:This is what I will do to this place and its people," declares the LORD. "I will make this city like Topheth.
24:19:13:The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the heavenly hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.'"
24:19:14:Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the LORD's temple and said to all the people,
24:19:15:"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going to bring on this city and all the towns around it every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have become stubborn and have not obeyed my words.'"
24:20:1:Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief officer in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
24:20:2:Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the Lord.
24:20:3:The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "The Lord has not called your name Pashhur, but rather Magor-missabib.
24:20:4:For this is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies while you watch. I will hand over all Judah to the king of Babylon. He will carry them away as captives to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.
24:20:5:Moreover, I will deliver all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and all its valuable things; all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hands of their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon.
24:20:6:As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, and there you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.'"
24:20:7:O Lord, you deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.
24:20:8:Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. The word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long.
24:20:9:But if I say, "I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name," his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.
24:20:10:I hear many whispering, "Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let's denounce him!" All my close friends are watching for me to stumble. "Perhaps he can be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him."
24:20:11:But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not succeed. Their lasting disgrace will never be forgotten.
24:20:12:O Lord Almighty, you who examine the righteous and see the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you I have committed my cause.
24:20:13:Sing to the Lord! Give praise to the Lord! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.
24:20:14:Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!
24:20:15:Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, "A child is born to you—a son!"
24:20:16:May that man be like the towns the Lord overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon.
24:20:17:For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever.
24:20:18:Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
24:21:1:At the time when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchijah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, he asked,
24:21:2:"Please inquire of the Lord on our behalf, because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will perform a miracle for us, as He has done in the past, and force him to withdraw."
24:21:3:Then Jeremiah answered them, "Tell Zedekiah this:
24:21:4:'The Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are besieging you outside the walls; and I will gather them into the center of this city.
24:21:5:I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, in anger, fury, and great wrath.
24:21:6:I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both people and animals; they will die from a terrible plague.
24:21:7:Afterward, declares the Lord, I will deliver King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and the people remaining in this city from the plague, sword, and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, their enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword; he will show no mercy or compassion.
24:21:8:To the people of this city, you must say, 'This is what the Lord says: I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death.
24:21:9:Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives.
24:21:10:I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares the Lord. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.'
24:21:11:To the royal house of Judah, hear the word of the Lord:
24:21:12:'O house of David, this is what the Lord says: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the hand of the oppressor, so that my wrath will not break out like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it, because of your evil deeds.'
24:21:13:Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, declares the Lord; you who say, 'Who can come down against us? Who can enter our dwellings?'
24:21:14:But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds, declares the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forest, and it will consume everything around it."
24:22:1:This is what the Lord says: "Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there:
24:22:2:Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on David's throne—you, your officials, and your people who enter these gates.
24:22:3:Thus says the Lord: Execute justice and righteousness, and rescue the one who has been robbed from the hand of the oppressor. Do not mistreat or do violence to the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
24:22:4:For if you truly obey this command, then kings sitting on David's throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people.
24:22:5:But if you do not obey these commands, declares the Lord, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin."
24:22:6:For this is what the Lord says about the royal palace of Judah: "You are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon; yet I will surely turn you into a desert, with no inhabitants.
24:22:7:I will summon destroyers against you, each with his weapons; they will cut down your choicest cedars and throw them into the fire.
24:22:8:People from many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?'
24:22:9:And they will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and worshiped other gods and served them.'"
24:22:10:Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for the one who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again.
24:22:11:For this is what the Lord says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: "He will never return.
24:22:12:He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again."
24:22:13:Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor.
24:22:14:He says, 'I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.' So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red.
24:22:15:Does having a lot of cedar make you a great king? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him.
24:22:16:He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?" declares the Lord.
24:22:17:"But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion."
24:22:18:Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: "They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!' They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!'
24:22:19:He will have the burial of a donkey—dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem."
24:22:20:Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed.
24:22:21:I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me.
24:22:22:The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness.
24:22:23:You who live in Lebanon, who are nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!
24:22:24:"As surely as I live," declares the Lord, "even if you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off.
24:22:25:I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians.
24:22:26:I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die.
24:22:27:They will never come back to the land they long to return to."
24:22:28:Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know?
24:22:29:O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord!
24:22:30:This is what the Lord says: "Record this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah."
24:23:1:Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! declares the Lord.
24:23:2:Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my flock and driven them away, and you haven't cared for them. Behold, I will punish you for the evil you've done, declares the Lord.
24:23:3:I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their pasture; they will be fruitful and multiply.
24:23:4:I will raise up shepherds over them who will care for them. They will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing, declares the Lord.
24:23:5:Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up a righteous Branch for David. He will reign as king and act wisely, doing justice and righteousness in the land.
24:23:6:In his days, Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteousness.
24:23:7:So then, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer say, "As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,"
24:23:8:but instead, "As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and from all the countries where he had banished them." For they will dwell in their own land.
24:23:9:Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like one overcome by wine, because of the Lord and his holy words.
24:23:10:The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse, it mourns. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course is evil, and their power is misused.
24:23:11:Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found their wickedness, declares the Lord.
24:23:12:Therefore, their path will be slippery; they will be driven into darkness and fall there. For I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment, declares the Lord.
24:23:13:Among the prophets of Samaria, I saw something disgusting: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24:23:14:But among the prophets of Jerusalem, I've seen something horrible: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from their wickedness. They have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.
24:23:15:Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets: I will feed them with bitterness and give them poisoned water to drink, for wickedness has spread from the prophets of Jerusalem throughout the land.
24:23:16:This is what the Lord Almighty says: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They fill you with false hopes; they speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord.
24:23:17:They keep saying to those who despise me, "The Lord says: You will have peace." And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts, they say, "No harm will come to you."
24:23:18:But who has stood in the council of the Lord to see or hear his word? Who has paid attention to his word and obeyed it?
24:23:19:Look, the storm of the Lord! His wrath has gone forth, a whirlwind swirling down upon the heads of the wicked.
24:23:20:The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In the days to come, you will understand this clearly.
24:23:21:I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message. I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied.
24:23:22:But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and turned them from their evil ways and deeds.
24:23:23:Am I only a God nearby, declares the Lord, and not a God far away?
24:23:24:Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see them? declares the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord.
24:23:25:I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name, claiming, "I had a dream! I had a dream!"
24:23:26:How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?
24:23:27:They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship.
24:23:28:The prophet who has a dream may recount it, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain? declares the Lord.
24:23:29:Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?
24:23:30:Therefore, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who steal my words from each other.
24:23:31:I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who use their tongues to declare, "This is what the Lord says."
24:23:32:I am against those who prophesy false dreams, declares the Lord. They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least, declares the Lord.
24:23:33:When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, "What is the message from the Lord?" say to them, "What message? I will forsake you, declares the Lord."
24:23:34:As for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, "The message from the Lord," I will punish that person and his household.
24:23:35:Instead, you should ask each other, "What has the Lord answered?" or "What has the Lord spoken?"
24:23:36:But do not mention "the message from the Lord" again, because each one's word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God.
24:23:37:This is what you should say to the prophet: "What has the Lord answered you?" or "What has the Lord spoken?"
24:23:38:But if you say, "The message from the Lord," this is what the Lord says: Because you have said these words, "The message from the Lord," even though I told you that you must not claim, "The message from the Lord,"
24:23:39:therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors.
24:23:40:I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.
24:24:1:In the time when the LORD showed Jeremiah two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple, after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with the officials, craftsmen, and metalworkers from Jerusalem, and brought them to Babylon.
24:24:2:One basket contained very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket held very bad figs, so rotten they couldn't be eaten.
24:24:3:Then the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I replied, "Figs: the good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so rotten they can't be eaten."
24:24:4:And the word of the LORD came to me:
24:24:5:"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Just as these good figs are, so will I regard the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians, with favor.
24:24:6:I will watch over them for their well-being and bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
24:24:7:I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.
24:24:8:But just as the rotten figs are so bad they cannot be eaten,' says the LORD, 'so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and those who live in Egypt.
24:24:9:I will make them an object of horror and evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I will drive them.
24:24:10:And I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they are completely destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.'"
24:25:1:In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord, concerning all the people of Judah:
24:25:2:"The Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
24:25:3:'For twenty-three years, since the thirteenth year of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, I have been sending my servants the prophets to you. They've spoken to you early and often, but you haven't listened or paid attention.
24:25:4:Even though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you time and again, you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear.
24:25:5:They said, "Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil deeds, and you can stay in the land that the Lord gave to you and your ancestors forever and ever.
24:25:6:Don't follow other gods to serve and worship them, and don't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will not bring harm to you."
24:25:7:But you didn't listen to me,' declares the Lord, 'and you provoked me to anger with the work of your hands, bringing harm upon yourselves.'
24:25:8:So this is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: 'Because you have not listened to my words,
24:25:9:I will summon all the tribes of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,' declares the Lord, 'and I will bring them against this land, its inhabitants, and all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror, scorn, and everlasting ruin.
24:25:10:I will banish the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp.
24:25:11:This whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
24:25:12:But when the seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' declares the Lord, 'for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, making it an everlasting desolation.
24:25:13:I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
24:25:14:For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them as well, and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.'"
24:25:15:For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24:25:16:When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them."
24:25:17:So I took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:
24:25:18:Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an object of horror, scorn, and cursing, as it is today;
24:25:19:Egypt, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all who live in the distant places;
24:25:20:all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);
24:25:21:Edom, Moab, and Ammon;
24:25:22:all the kings of Tyre, Sidon, and the coastlands across the sea;
24:25:23:Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who are in distant places;
24:25:24:all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert;
24:25:25:all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;
24:25:26:and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink it too.
24:25:27:"Then tell them, 'This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.'
24:25:28:And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, 'This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: You must drink it!
24:25:29:For behold, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all who live on the earth,' declares the Lord of Heaven's Armies.
24:25:30:Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them: 'The Lord will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, shouting against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24:25:31:The noise will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has an accusation against the nations; he will enter into judgment with all people and put the wicked to the sword,' declares the Lord.
24:25:32:This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: 'Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.'
24:25:33:At that time those slain by the Lord will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground.
24:25:34:Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the best of the rams.
24:25:35:The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape.
24:25:36:Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the Lord is destroying their pasture.
24:25:37:The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
24:25:38:Like a lion he will leave his lair, and their land will become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor and because of the Lord's fierce anger."
24:26:1:At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, a message came from the Lord. This is what it said:
24:26:2:"The Lord says, 'Stand in the courtyard of the Lord's house and speak to all the people of the cities of Judah who come to worship in the Lord's house. Tell them everything I command you; do not leave out a single word.
24:26:3:Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways. Then I will change my mind about the disaster I plan to bring upon them because of their wicked deeds.
24:26:4:Tell them that this is what the Lord says: If you don't obey me and follow the law I have given you,
24:26:5:and if you don't listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you time and again, though you haven't listened,
24:26:6:then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth.'"
24:26:7:The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
24:26:8:As soon as Jeremiah finished delivering the message from the Lord, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, saying, "You must die!
24:26:9:Why do you prophesy in the name of the Lord that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
24:26:10:When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they came up from the king's palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord's house.
24:26:11:Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man deserves to die because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
24:26:12:Jeremiah answered the officials and all the people, "The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
24:26:13:Now reform your ways and your actions, and obey the Lord your God. Then the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.
24:26:14:As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right.
24:26:15:But know this: if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words."
24:26:16:Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man does not deserve to die! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God."
24:26:17:Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people,
24:26:18:"Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, 'This is what the Lord Almighty says: Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.'
24:26:19:Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Didn't Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his favor? And didn't the Lord relent of the disaster he had pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"
24:26:20:There was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim. He prophesied against this city and this land just as Jeremiah did.
24:26:21:When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.
24:26:22:King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some other men to Egypt.
24:26:23:They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.
24:26:24:Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
24:27:1:In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came from the Lord to Jeremiah:
24:27:2:The Lord instructed me to make a yoke out of straps and wooden crossbars and put it on my neck.
24:27:3:Then he told me to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who had come to Jerusalem to see Zedekiah.
24:27:4:The message I was to give them was: "The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says to tell your masters,
24:27:5:'I created the earth and its people and animals, and I have given everything to whomever I choose.
24:27:6:Now I am handing all these lands over to my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even made the wild animals subject to him.
24:27:7:All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time comes for his own land to be conquered. Then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
24:27:8:As for any nation or kingdom that refuses to serve Nebuchadnezzar and does not submit to his yoke, I will punish that nation with war, famine, and disease until I have completely destroyed it,' declares the Lord.
24:27:9:So don't listen to your prophets, fortune-tellers, interpreters of dreams, mediums, or sorcerers who tell you not to serve the king of Babylon.
24:27:10:They are prophesying lies that will only lead to your exile and ruin.
24:27:11:But if a nation submits to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will let that nation stay in its own land, farming it and living there,' declares the Lord."
24:27:12:I delivered this same message to King Zedekiah of Judah: "Submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and you will live.
24:27:13:Why should you and your people die from war, famine, and disease, as the Lord has decreed for any nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?
24:27:14:Do not listen to the words of those prophets who say, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies.
24:27:15:'I have not sent them,' declares the Lord. 'They are prophesying lies in my name. If you listen to them, I will drive you out, and you will perish along with the false prophets.'"
24:27:16:Then I spoke to the priests and all the people, saying, "This is what the Lord says: 'Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, "The vessels of the Lord's house will soon be brought back from Babylon," for they are prophesying lies.
24:27:17:Don't listen to them! Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin?
24:27:18:If they really are prophets and have the word of the Lord, let them plead with the Lord Almighty that the remaining vessels in the Lord's house, the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon.'
24:27:19:For this is what the Lord Almighty says about the pillars, the Sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels left in the city:
24:27:20:'They will be taken to Babylon and remain there until the day I come for them,' declares the Lord. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'"
24:28:1:In that same year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fifth month of his fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and all the people.
24:28:2:"This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24:28:3:Within two years, I will bring back to this place all the articles of the Lord's temple that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away and carried off to Babylon.
24:28:4:I will also bring back Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with all the exiles who were taken to Babylon,' declares the Lord, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"
24:28:5:Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord.
24:28:6:He said, "Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
24:28:7:Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
24:28:8:The prophets who preceded us from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and disease against many countries and great kingdoms.
24:28:9:As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes true, it will be known that the Lord has truly sent the prophet."
24:28:10:Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it.
24:28:11:He said before all the people, "This is what the Lord says: 'In the same way, I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within two years.'" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
24:28:12:After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24:28:13:"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the Lord says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.
24:28:14:For this is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.'"
24:28:15:Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.
24:28:16:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.'"
24:28:17:In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.
24:29:1:This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the elders, priests, prophets, and all the people who had been exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar.
24:29:2:Jeremiah's letter included the words of the Lord after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalworkers had left Jerusalem.
24:29:3:It was entrusted to Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. The letter said:
24:29:4:"The Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says to all those he sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24:29:5:'Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce.
24:29:6:Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease.
24:29:7:Seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.'
24:29:8:For this is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams they encourage you to have.
24:29:9:They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,' declares the Lord.
24:29:10:This is what the Lord says: 'When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place.
24:29:11:For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
24:29:12:Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
24:29:13:You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
24:29:14:I will be found by you,' declares the Lord, 'and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,' declares the Lord, 'and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.'
24:29:15:You may say, 'The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,'
24:29:16:but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David's throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—
24:29:17:'I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them, and I will make them like rotten figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
24:29:18:I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and plague and will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them.
24:29:19:For they have not listened to my words,' declares the Lord, 'words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either,' declares the Lord.
24:29:20:So hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24:29:21:This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: 'I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes.
24:29:22:Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: 'May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.'
24:29:23:For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and in my name have spoken lies, which I did not tell them to do. I know it and am a witness to it,' declares the Lord.
24:29:24:To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say:
24:29:25:"This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'You have sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests, saying:
24:29:26:The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the Lord; you should put any madman who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons.
24:29:27:So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you?
24:29:28:For he has sent this message to us in Babylon: 'It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce.'"
24:29:29:Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
24:29:30:Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24:29:31:"Send this message to all the exiles: 'This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has led you to believe a lie,
24:29:32:this is what the Lord says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people,' declares the Lord, 'because he has preached rebellion against the Lord.'"
24:30:1:At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.
24:30:2:The Lord says, "My people have gone through a difficult time, but I will bring them back and restore their fortunes.
24:30:3:I will gather them from all the countries where I scattered them in my anger, and I will bring them back to this land. They will possess it once again.
24:30:4:In those days, I will rebuild the broken city, and its walls will be restored.
24:30:5:They will sing songs of joy, and their hearts will rejoice because of the goodness I show them.
24:30:6:Ask now, and see if a man can give birth. Why then do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach, like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale?
24:30:7:Alas! That day is so great that there's no other like it. It's a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.
24:30:8:On that day, declares the Lord Almighty, I will break the yoke off their necks and tear away their chains. They will no longer be slaves to others.
24:30:9:Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24:30:10:So don't be afraid, Jacob my servant, declares the Lord. Don't be dismayed, Israel. I will surely save you from afar, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.
24:30:11:For I am with you to save you, declares the Lord. I will completely destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you justly, but I won't let you go unpunished.
24:30:12:This is what the Lord says: Your wound is incurable, and your injury is beyond healing.
24:30:13:There's no one to plead your cause or bind up your injury. You have no healing remedies.
24:30:14:All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't care about you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as a cruel one, because of your great guilt and many sins.
24:30:15:Why do you cry out over your wound? Your pain is incurable. Because of your great guilt and many sins, I have done these things to you.
24:30:16:But all who devour you will be devoured, and all your enemies will be sent into captivity. Those who plunder you will be plundered, and those who attack you will be attacked.
24:30:17:I will restore your health and heal your wounds, declares the Lord, because they called you an outcast, saying, 'This is Zion, no one cares for her.'
24:30:18:The Lord says, "I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings. The city will be rebuilt on its ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place.
24:30:19:From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will increase their numbers, and they will not be decreased. I will bring them honor, and they will not be despised.
24:30:20:Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me. I will punish all who oppress them.
24:30:21:Their leader will be one of their own, and their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near, and he will approach me, for who is he who would dare to approach me? declares the Lord.
24:30:22:You will be my people, and I will be your God."
24:30:23:Look! The storm of the Lord's wrath has gone forth, a sweeping tempest; it will swirl around the heads of the wicked.
24:30:24:The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until he has fully accomplished his purpose. In the days to come, you will understand this.
24:31:1:At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.
24:31:2:This is what the Lord says: The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; when Israel sought rest, I appeared to them from afar.
24:31:3:The Lord has loved us with an everlasting love; therefore, He continues to show us His kindness.
24:31:4:Once again, I will build you up, O virgin Israel, and you will be rebuilt. You will take up your tambourines once more and dance joyfully with those who celebrate.
24:31:5:You will plant vineyards again on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant and enjoy the fruit.
24:31:6:For there will come a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim, "Arise, let's go up to Zion, to the Lord our God."
24:31:7:This is what the Lord says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations! Proclaim, praise, and say, "Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel."
24:31:8:Look, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return.
24:31:9:They will come with weeping, and I will lead them with prayers of supplication. I will guide them to streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, for I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son.
24:31:10:Hear the word of the Lord, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: "He who scattered Israel will gather them and watch over his flock like a shepherd."
24:31:11:For the Lord will ransom Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they.
24:31:12:They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord—the grain, the new wine, and the oil, the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like a well-watered garden, and they will never languish again.
24:31:13:Then the young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
24:31:14:I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my goodness, declares the Lord.
24:31:15:This is what the Lord says: A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.
24:31:16:This is what the Lord says: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded, declares the Lord. They will return from the land of the enemy.
24:31:17:So there is hope for your future, declares the Lord; your children will return to their own land.
24:31:18:I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return because you are the Lord my God.
24:31:19:After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.'
24:31:20:Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him, declares the Lord.
24:31:21:Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, O Virgin Israel, return to your towns.
24:31:22:How long will you wander, unfaithful daughter Israel? The Lord will create a new thing on earth—the woman will return to the man.
24:31:23:This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The Lord bless you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred mountain.'
24:31:24:People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those who move about with their flocks.
24:31:25:I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint."
24:31:26:At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
24:31:27:"The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah with the offspring of people and of animals.
24:31:28:Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," declares the Lord.
24:31:29:"In those days people will no longer say, 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
24:31:30:Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.
24:31:31:The time is coming," declares the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
24:31:32:It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them," declares the Lord.
24:31:33:"This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time," declares the Lord. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
24:31:34:No longer will they teach their neighbor or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord. "For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."
24:31:35:This is what the Lord says, He who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the Lord Almighty is His name:
24:31:36:"Only if these decrees vanish from my sight," declares the Lord, "will Israel ever cease being a nation before me."
24:31:37:This is what the Lord says: "Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done," declares the Lord.
24:31:38:"The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24:31:39:The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah.
24:31:40:The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished."
24:32:1:During the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign as king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem. This was the eighteenth year of his rule.
24:32:2:At that time, the Lord spoke to Jeremiah while he was under arrest in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
24:32:3:King Zedekiah had imprisoned him there, accusing him of prophesying that Jerusalem would be handed over to the king of Babylon and that they would conquer it.
24:32:4:Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
24:32:5:'Listen up! I am the Lord, the God of all people. Is anything too difficult for me?
24:32:6:That's why I'm telling you that this city will be handed over to the Babylonian army, who will capture it.
24:32:7:They will break through the city walls, burn down the houses, and destroy everything. They will do this because the people of Judah have angered me by worshiping other gods and burning incense to them.
24:32:8:The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes since their youth. They've only provoked me with the work of their hands,' declares the Lord.
24:32:9:'This city has stirred up my anger and wrath from the day it was built until now. So I must remove it from my sight
24:32:10:because of all the wickedness the people of Israel and Judah have committed, which has made me angry. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, and the people of Judah and Jerusalem have all provoked me.
24:32:11:They turned their backs on me, not their faces. Though I tried to teach them again and again, they wouldn't listen or respond to my discipline.
24:32:12:They set up disgusting idols in the temple that bears my name and defiled it.
24:32:13:They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech—something I never commanded, nor did it ever enter my mind that they should commit such a detestable act, leading Judah into sin.'
24:32:14:"So now the Lord says, 'I'm about to hand this city over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who will capture it.
24:32:15:The Babylonian army is already attacking this city, and they will take it. I will hand it over to them, and they will burn it down, along with the houses where people have provoked me by burning incense on the rooftops to Baal and pouring out drink offerings to other gods.'
24:32:16:"But even though all this is happening, I want you to buy a field in your hometown of Anathoth from your cousin Hanamel. You must weigh out the silver, sign the deed, and have witnesses present.
24:32:17:So I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel, weighed out the silver, signed the deed, and had witnesses confirm the transaction.
24:32:18:I took the sealed deed and the open copy, and gave them to Baruch, son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who signed the deed, as well as all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
24:32:19:I instructed Baruch in their presence, saying,
24:32:20:'The Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents—both the sealed deed and the open copy—and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.
24:32:21:For the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says that someday people will again buy houses, fields, and vineyards in this land.'
24:32:22:"After I had given the deed to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord, saying:
24:32:23:'Ah, Sovereign Lord! You made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.
24:32:24:You show steadfast love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents' sins upon their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord of Heaven's Armies,
24:32:25:you are great in counsel and mighty in deed. Your eyes are open to all the ways of humans, rewarding each one according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve.
24:32:26:You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt, and you continue to do so even today, both in Israel and among all people. You have made a name for yourself, as is the case today.
24:32:27:You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
24:32:28:You gave them this land, which you had promised to their ancestors—a land flowing with milk and honey.
24:32:29:They entered and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law. They failed to do what you commanded them to do, so you brought all this disaster upon them.
24:32:30:Look at how the enemy has besieged the city, causing great distress. The city is about to be handed over to the Babylonians, who will capture it. What you said would happen is now happening, and yet you see it.
24:32:31:You told me, Lord, to buy the field with silver and have witnesses present, even though the city is being handed over to the Babylonians.'"
24:32:32:Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:
24:32:33:"I am the Lord, the God of all people. Is anything too difficult for me?
24:32:34:That's why I'm telling you that I will hand this city over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who will capture it.
24:32:35:The Babylonian army will break through the walls of this city, burn it down, and destroy it because of the anger I have toward the people of Israel and Judah for their wickedness and idolatry.
24:32:36:But I will gather the people from all the countries where I've scattered them in my anger, fury, and great wrath. I will bring them back to this place and let them live here in safety.
24:32:37:They will be my people, and I will be their God.
24:32:38:I will give them a single purpose and cause them to fear me for their own good and the good of their children after them.
24:32:39:I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will never stop doing good to them. I will put the fear of me in their hearts so they will never turn away from me.
24:32:40:I will rejoice in doing good to them and will surely plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
24:32:41:"This is what the Lord says: Just as I have brought all this disaster upon these people, so I will bring upon them all the good things I have promised them.
24:32:42:Fields will again be bought in this land, even though you think it's desolate and without people or animals, handed over to the Babylonians.
24:32:43:People will buy fields for money, sign deeds, seal them, and have witnesses present in the land of Benjamin, the villages around Jerusalem, the towns of Judah, the towns of the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes,' declares the Lord."
24:33:1:While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second time.
24:33:2:"This is what the LORD says, who made the earth and formed it, establishing it firmly—He is the LORD:
24:33:3:'Call out to me, and I will answer you, revealing great and hidden things that you do not know.'
24:33:4:For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, declares concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of Judah's kings, which are being torn down because of the siege ramps and the sword:
24:33:5:'They will be filled with the dead bodies of those whom I have struck down in my anger and wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city due to all its wickedness.
24:33:6:But look, I will bring healing and peace to this city. I will heal their wounds and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.
24:33:7:I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them as they were before.
24:33:8:I will cleanse them from all the guilt they have incurred against me, and I will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.
24:33:9:This city will bring me joy, praise, and honor before all nations on earth when they hear of all the good I will do for it. They will be in awe and tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide.
24:33:10:This is what the LORD says: 'You say about this place, "It is a desolate waste, without people or animals." Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more
24:33:11:the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD, saying, "Give thanks to the LORD Almighty, for the LORD is good; his love endures forever." For I will restore the fortunes of this land as they were before,' says the LORD.
24:33:12:This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'In this desolate place, without people or animals—and in all its towns—there will once again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
24:33:13:In the towns of the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, the villages around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,' says the LORD.
24:33:14:'The days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the gracious promise I made to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
24:33:15:In those days and at that time, I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
24:33:16:In those days, Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness.'
24:33:17:For this is what the LORD says: 'David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
24:33:18:nor will the Levitical priests ever lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices continually.'"
24:33:19:The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24:33:20:"This is what the LORD says: 'If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time,
24:33:21:then also my covenant with David my servant can be broken, and he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests who minister before me.
24:33:22:As the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so will I increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me.'"
24:33:23:The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24:33:24:"Have you not noticed what these people are saying: 'The LORD has rejected the two kingdoms he chose'? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation.
24:33:25:This is what the LORD says: 'If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed laws of heaven and earth,
24:33:26:then I will also reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant, and not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.'"
24:34:1:During the time when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army along with all the kingdoms under his control and all other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and its surrounding towns, the following message was given to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24:34:2:"This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go and speak to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him that this is what the Lord says: I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.
24:34:3:You won't be able to escape his grasp; you'll definitely be captured and handed over to him. You'll have a face-to-face meeting with the king of Babylon, and he'll speak to you directly. Then you'll be taken to Babylon.
24:34:4:But listen to the promise of the Lord, Zedekiah, king of Judah: Even though you will not escape the king of Babylon, your life will be spared, and you won't die by the sword.
24:34:5:Instead, you'll die peacefully, and as they burned incense for your ancestors, the previous kings who ruled before you, so will they do for you. They'll mourn for you, saying, 'Alas, our master!' This is the Lord's declaration."
24:34:6:So Jeremiah the prophet relayed all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
24:34:7:while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the remaining towns of Judah, including Lachish and Azekah. These fortified cities were the only ones left standing among the towns of Judah.
24:34:8:After King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for their slaves, this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
24:34:9:"This is what the Lord says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of their slavery. It said,
24:34:10:'At the end of every seven years, each of you must set free any fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you and has served you for six years. You must let him go free.' But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me.
24:34:11:Recently, you changed your ways and did what is right in my sight by proclaiming freedom for your fellow countrymen. You made a covenant before me in the house that bears my name.
24:34:12:But then you went back on your word and profaned my name. Each of you took back the male and female slaves you had set free to live as they wished, and you forced them to become your slaves again.
24:34:13:So this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming true freedom for your brothers and sisters. Therefore, I now proclaim freedom for you, declares the Lord, but it will be freedom to die by sword, plague, and famine! I will make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24:34:14:I will punish those who have violated my covenant and have not kept the terms of the agreement they made before me when they cut the calf in two and walked between its pieces.
24:34:15:The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,
24:34:16:I will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the wild animals.
24:34:17:I will also hand over Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his officials to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn for now.
24:34:18:I will summon them back, declares the Lord, and they will attack this city and capture it, burning it down. I will make the towns of Judah desolate, with no one living there."
24:35:1:This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the time of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah.
24:35:2:"Go to the house of the Rechabites and invite them to come to one of the side rooms in the Lord's temple. Offer them wine to drink."
24:35:3:So I went to get Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, grandson of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the entire family of the Rechabites.
24:35:4:I brought them into the Lord's temple, into the room of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over the room of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.
24:35:5:Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the members of the Rechabite family and said to them, "Drink some wine."
24:35:6:But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jonadab, son of Rechab, gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants shall ever drink wine.
24:35:7:Also, you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you shall not own these things, but always live in tents, so that you may live a long time in the land where you are nomads.'
24:35:8:We have obeyed the words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, our ancestor, by not drinking wine our whole lives—us, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.
24:35:9:We also haven't built houses for ourselves to live in, nor do we have vineyards, fields or crops.
24:35:10:We have lived in tents and followed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
24:35:11:But when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded the land, we said, 'Let's go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.' So we have been living in Jerusalem ever since."
24:35:12:Then the Lord spoke to Jeremiah:
24:35:13:"This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the Lord.
24:35:14:'Jonadab, son of Rechab, ordered his descendants not to drink wine, and they have kept his command. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their ancestor's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.
24:35:15:I have sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, "Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors." But you have not paid attention or listened to me.
24:35:16:The descendants of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have carried out the command their ancestor gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.'
24:35:17:Therefore, this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I will bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'"
24:35:18:Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rechabites, "This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and kept all his commands and done everything he ordered,
24:35:19:Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab, son of Rechab, will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.'"
24:36:1:During the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign over Judah, the Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying,
24:36:2:"Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you about Israel, Judah, and all the other nations from the time I first began speaking to you during the reign of Josiah until now.
24:36:3:Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to bring upon them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their sins and wrongdoings."
24:36:4:So Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah, who wrote down on a scroll all the words the Lord had spoken to Jeremiah.
24:36:5:Then Jeremiah instructed Baruch, "I am restricted; I cannot go to the Lord's temple.
24:36:6:So you go to the temple on a day of fasting and read the words of the Lord from the scroll you wrote at my dictation. Read them so all the people in the temple can hear, as well as all the citizens of Judah who have come from their towns.
24:36:7:Maybe they will present their petitions before the Lord and turn from their evil ways, for the Lord has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people."
24:36:8:Baruch, son of Neriah, did everything Jeremiah the prophet instructed him to do, reading the words of the Lord from the scroll in the temple.
24:36:9:In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim's reign over Judah, a fast was proclaimed before the Lord for all the people in Jerusalem and everyone who had come from the towns of Judah.
24:36:10:At that time, Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the temple of the Lord, in the room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary. This room was in the upper courtyard near the entrance of the New Gate of the temple.
24:36:11:Micaiah, son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll.
24:36:12:He went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
24:36:13:Micaiah informed them of everything he had heard when Baruch read the scroll to the people.
24:36:14:Then all the officials sent Jehudi, son of Nethaniah and grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll you read to the people and come." So Baruch, son of Neriah, took the scroll and went to them.
24:36:15:They said to him, "Sit down and read the scroll to us," so Baruch read it to them.
24:36:16:When they heard all the words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."
24:36:17:Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you write down all these words? Did Jeremiah dictate them?"
24:36:18:Baruch replied, "Yes, he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them down with ink on the scroll."
24:36:19:The officials then said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah must both go into hiding. Do not let anyone know where you are."
24:36:20:After putting the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king's court and reported everything to him.
24:36:21:The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing around him.
24:36:22:It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in his winter apartment with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.
24:36:23:As Jehudi read three or four columns of the scroll, the king would cut them off with a scribe's knife and throw them into the firepot until the entire scroll was burned up.
24:36:24:Neither the king nor any of his attendants who heard these words showed any fear or tore their clothes.
24:36:25:Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24:36:26:Instead, the king ordered Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them.
24:36:27:After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
24:36:28:"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned up.
24:36:29:You are to say about Jehoiakim king of Judah: 'The Lord declares that you have burned this scroll and asked, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe out both its people and animals?"
24:36:30:Therefore, the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David's throne, and his dead body will be thrown out to be exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.
24:36:31:I will punish him, his children, and his officials for their wickedness; I will bring disaster on them and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as I promised but they did not listen.'"
24:36:32:So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch, son of Neriah, the scribe. Baruch wrote on it at Jeremiah's dictation all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire, and many similar words were added to them.
24:37:1:King Zedekiah, son of Josiah, reigned in Judah instead of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made him king over the land.
24:37:2:However, neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land paid attention to the words of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
24:37:3:Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to ask Jeremiah, "Please pray for us to the Lord our God."
24:37:4:At that time, Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, as they had not yet put him in prison.
24:37:5:Pharaoh's army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans besieging Jerusalem heard the news, they withdrew from the city.
24:37:6:Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:
24:37:7:"This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of me, 'Pharaoh's army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt, their own land.
24:37:8:The Chaldeans will come back and attack this city. They will capture it and burn it down.'
24:37:9:This is what the Lord says: 'Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, "The Chaldeans will surely leave us," for they will not.
24:37:10:Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men remained in their tents, they would still rise up and burn this city down.'"
24:37:11:When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's approaching forces,
24:37:12:Jeremiah started to leave the city and go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people.
24:37:13:But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin, a guard named Irijah, son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, arrested Jeremiah the prophet, accusing him, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!"
24:37:14:"That's not true!" Jeremiah said. "I am not deserting to the Babylonians." But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24:37:15:They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had converted into a prison.
24:37:16:So Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained for a long time.
24:37:17:Later, King Zedekiah sent for him and questioned him privately in his palace, asking, "Is there any word from the Lord?" Jeremiah replied, "There is." He then said, "You will be handed over to the king of Babylon."
24:37:18:Moreover, Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
24:37:19:Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, 'The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land?'
24:37:20:Now please hear me, my lord the king; let my plea come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there."
24:37:21:King Zedekiah then ordered that Jeremiah be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24:38:1:At that time, Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying:
24:38:2:"The Lord says, 'Those who stay in this city will die by the sword, famine, or disease. But whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. They'll escape with their lives and find safety.'
24:38:3:The Lord also says, 'This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'"
24:38:4:Then the officials approached the king, demanding, "This man must be put to death! His words are weakening the morale of the remaining soldiers and the people. He doesn't seek our well-being but our destruction."
24:38:5:King Zedekiah replied, "He is in your hands. I won't stand in your way."
24:38:6:So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered him down with ropes. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.
24:38:7:Ebed-Melech, a Cushite official in the royal palace, learned that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. As the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
24:38:8:Ebed-Melech went to the king and said, "Your Majesty, what these men have done to Jeremiah the prophet is wrong. They've thrown him into the cistern, where he'll starve to death since there's no more food in the city."
24:38:9:The king ordered Ebed-Melech the Cushite, "Take thirty men from here and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."
24:38:10:Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
24:38:11:Ebed-Melech said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did as instructed.
24:38:12:So they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24:38:13:Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the Lord. The king said to Jeremiah, "I have a question for you; don't hide anything from me."
24:38:14:Jeremiah replied, "If I tell you the truth, won't you have me killed? And even if I give you advice, you won't listen to me."
24:38:15:But King Zedekiah secretly swore an oath to Jeremiah, "As the Lord lives, who gave us life, I will not kill you or hand you over to those who want to take your life."
24:38:16:Then Jeremiah told Zedekiah, "The Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared, and this city won't be burned down. You and your family will live.
24:38:17:But if you refuse to surrender, this city will fall into the hands of the Babylonians, who will burn it down. You won't escape from them.'"
24:38:18:King Zedekiah responded to Jeremiah, "I'm afraid of the Judeans who have defected to the Babylonians. If they hand me over to them, they'll mistreat me."
24:38:19:Jeremiah reassured him, "They won't hand you over. Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you. Then everything will go well for you, and your life will be spared.
24:38:20:But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has shown me:
24:38:21:All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. They'll say to you, 'Your trusted friends misled and overpowered you. Your feet sank in the mud, and they deserted you.'
24:38:22:All your wives and children will be taken to the Babylonians, and you yourself will not escape from their hands. You'll be captured by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down."
24:38:23:Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Don't let anyone know about this conversation, or you'll die.
24:38:24:If the officials find out that I've talked to you and come to question you, tell them, 'I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.'"
24:38:25:When the officials came to Jeremiah, they asked him about his meeting with the king. He answered them exactly as the king had instructed him. So they stopped questioning him because they hadn't overheard the conversation.
24:38:26:Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
24:39:1:In the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, during the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army besieged Jerusalem.
24:39:2:In the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city walls were breached.
24:39:3:When Jerusalem was invaded, all the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate, including Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the chief officer, Nergal-sharezer the high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon.
24:39:4:Upon realizing the situation, King Zedekiah and his soldiers tried to escape during the night, leaving the city through the king's garden and the gate between the two walls. They headed toward the Arabah.
24:39:5:But the Chaldean army pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment upon him.
24:39:6:Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah's sons killed before his eyes at Riblah. He also killed all the nobles of Judah.
24:39:7:Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him in bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
24:39:8:The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24:39:9:Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, exiled the remaining people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to him, and the rest of the population.
24:39:10:However, Nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind to work the vineyards and fields.
24:39:11:Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, gave orders concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard:
24:39:12:"Find him, take care of him, and do not harm him. Grant him anything he asks for."
24:39:13:So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, Nebushazban the high official, Nergal-sharezer the chief officer, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon
24:39:14:sent for Jeremiah and had him taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home. Thus, Jeremiah stayed among his own people.
24:39:15:While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him:
24:39:16:"Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words of disaster, not prosperity. You will witness them firsthand.
24:39:17:But on that day, I will rescue you, declares the Lord. You will not be handed over to those you fear.
24:39:18:Indeed, I will save you. You will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life because you have trusted in me, declares the Lord.'"
24:40:1:In those days, after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had released Jeremiah from Ramah, he took him and said, "The Lord your God has pronounced this disaster on this place.
24:40:2:Now the Lord has brought it about, and has done just as He said. Because you people have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, this thing has come upon you.
24:40:3:But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come; I will look after you. But if you don't want to come, that's fine too. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it best and right for you to go."
24:40:4:Then Jeremiah said to him, "I won't go to Babylon. Instead, I will stay here in the land of Judah." So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a gift and let him go.
24:40:5:Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
24:40:6:When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women, and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried off to exile in Babylon,
24:40:7:They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
24:40:8:Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, reassured them and their men, saying, "Don't be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Settle down in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.
24:40:9:As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us. But you, gather wine, summer fruits, and oil, put them in your vessels, and live in the cities you have taken."
24:40:10:When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah as governor over them,
24:40:11:They returned from all the places where they had been scattered. They came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered a great harvest of wine and summer fruits.
24:40:12:Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24:40:13:and warned him, "Are you aware that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, to assassinate you?" But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, did not believe them.
24:40:14:Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, secretly spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, "Let me go and kill Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to be scattered, and the remnant of Judah to perish?"
24:40:15:But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, "Don't do this wicked thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true."
24:41:1:In the seventh month, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama from the royal family, came with ten men and attacked Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. They killed him along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
24:41:2:On the following day, before anyone knew about the murder of Gedaliah,
24:41:3:eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, with their beards shaved, clothes torn, and bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the Lord.
24:41:4:Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he encountered them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam."
24:41:5:As soon as they came into the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and his men slaughtered them and threw their bodies into a cistern.
24:41:6:But among them were ten men who pleaded with Ishmael, saying, "Don't kill us! We have hidden stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the fields." So he spared them and didn't kill them with the others.
24:41:7:The cistern where Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he had killed was a large one that King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha, king of Israel. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled it with the corpses.
24:41:8:Then Ishmael took captive all the remaining people in Mizpah, including the king's daughters and everyone else who had been left under the care of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, took them as prisoners and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
24:41:9:When Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the military leaders with him heard about the evil deeds of Ishmael, son of Nethaniah,
24:41:10:they gathered their men and went to fight against Ishmael, son of Nethaniah. They found him near the large pool at Gibeon.
24:41:11:When all the captives taken by Ishmael saw Johanan, son of Kareah, and the other military leaders, they were glad.
24:41:12:So all the people Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and joined Johanan, son of Kareah.
24:41:13:But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, managed to escape from Johanan with eight of his men and went to the Ammonites.
24:41:14:Afterward, Johanan, son of Kareah, and the other military leaders took all the people they had rescued from Ishmael, son of Nethaniah—the soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom Ishmael had captured after killing Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.
24:41:15:They went from Gibeon and stopped at the lodging place of Chimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt.
24:41:16:They intended to go to Egypt because they were afraid of the Chaldeans; for Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
24:42:1:When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people about everything the Lord their God had commanded him to say,
24:42:2:Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to tell us not to go to Egypt to live there.
24:42:3:Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians so they may kill us or exile us to Babylon."
24:42:4:So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and the people disobeyed the Lord's command to stay in the land of Judah.
24:42:5:Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
24:42:6:They also led away the men, women, children, and the king's daughters, as well as every person Nebuzaradan, commander of the imperial guard, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, including Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
24:42:7:They entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes.
24:42:8:Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
24:42:9:"Take some large stones in your hands and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes while the people of Judah watch.
24:42:10:Then say to them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them.
24:42:11:He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.
24:42:12:I will set fire to the temples of Egypt's gods; Nebuchadnezzar will burn those temples and take the gods captive. As a shepherd wraps his garment around him, so will he wrap Egypt around himself and depart from there unscathed.
24:42:13:There in the temple of the sun in Egypt, he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.'"
24:43:1:After Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people about everything the Lord their God had sent him to tell them,
24:43:2:Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men responded, "You're lying! The Lord our God didn't send you to say, 'Don't go to Egypt to live there.'
24:43:3:Instead, Baruch son of Neriah is stirring you up against us so that the Babylonians can kill us or take us captive to Babylon."
24:43:4:So Johanan son of Kareah, all the military leaders, and all the people refused to obey the Lord's command to stay in the land of Judah.
24:43:5:Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders took with them all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah after being scattered among the nations.
24:43:6:They took the men, women, children, king's daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
24:43:7:Ignoring the Lord's command, they entered Egypt and arrived at Tahpanhes.
24:43:8:Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
24:43:9:"Take some large stones in your hand and bury them in the clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes. Do this while the people of Judah are watching.
24:43:10:Then tell them, 'This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones that I have hidden. He will spread his royal canopy above them.
24:43:11:He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.
24:43:12:He will set fire to the temples of the Egyptian gods, and he will burn their idols and take them as plunder. He will wrap himself with Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself in his garment, and then he will leave unharmed.
24:43:13:He will also shatter the sacred pillars at the temple of the sun in Egypt and burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods.'"
24:44:1:This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah living in the land of Egypt, specifically those residing in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the region of Pathros:
24:44:2:"The Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen the disaster I brought upon Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Today they are in ruins, with no one living there.
24:44:3:This happened because of the evil they committed, provoking me by worshiping and serving other gods, which neither they nor their ancestors knew.
24:44:4:I repeatedly sent my servants, the prophets, to warn them, but they did not listen or pay attention.
24:44:5:Now I tell you again: Stop your wicked deeds and worship only me! If you obey, then you will live in the land I gave to you and your ancestors forever.
24:44:6:But you didn't listen or pay attention; instead, you followed the stubbornness of your own hearts and pursued other gods, leading to your own ruin.
24:44:7:So now, the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, asks: Why do you persist in harming yourselves by worshiping other gods, adding to the destruction of Judah and bringing more calamity upon yourselves?
24:44:8:You have provoked me with the offerings you make to other gods in Egypt. By doing this, you only bring destruction upon yourselves, making yourselves an object of scorn and cursing among all nations on earth.
24:44:9:Have you forgotten the wickedness of your ancestors, the sins of the kings and queens of Judah, and your own transgressions in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
24:44:10:To this day, they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence. They have not followed my instructions or obeyed the laws I set before them and their ancestors.
24:44:11:Therefore, the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, declares: I am determined to bring disaster upon you and to cut off all Judah.
24:44:12:I will take away the remnant of Judah who insisted on coming to Egypt to settle here, and they will perish. Only a few will escape death and return to the land of Judah.
24:44:13:Those who survive will know whose words stand - mine or theirs.
24:44:14:This will be the sign that I will punish you in this place so that you may know that my threats of disaster against you will surely come to pass:
24:44:15:Behold, I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, to his enemies, just as I handed over Zedekiah, king of Judah, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon."
24:44:16:Then the people living in Egypt, both men and women, answered Jeremiah, "We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord!
24:44:17:Instead, we will continue doing what we vowed - making offerings to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we and our ancestors, our kings and officials did in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Back then, we had plenty of food, were prosperous, and saw no misfortune.
24:44:18:But since we stopped making offerings to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by sword and famine."
24:44:19:The women added, "When we made offerings to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did our husbands not know what we were doing? We baked cakes bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her."
24:44:20:Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who had given him that answer:
24:44:21:"Do you think the Lord didn't know or see the offerings you made in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem to other gods?
24:44:22:The Lord could no longer bear your evil deeds and the detestable things you did; that is why your land became a desolation, an object of cursing, and a wasteland, with no one living there today.
24:44:23:It is because you burned incense and sinned against the Lord, not obeying his voice or following his law, his decrees, and his testimonies, that this disaster has befallen you, as it is today."
24:44:24:Jeremiah continued, "Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who are in Egypt:
24:44:25:This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have stated with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, 'We will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.' Go ahead, then, and fulfill your vows! Keep your promises!
24:44:26:But hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who are living in Egypt: I swear by my great name, says the Lord, that no one from Judah living in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or use it in an oath, saying, 'As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives.'
24:44:27:I am watching over them for harm, not for good; all the people of Judah who are in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are completely destroyed.
24:44:28:Those who escape the sword will return from Egypt to Judah, few in number. The whole remnant of Judah who went to live in Egypt will know whose words stand - mine or theirs.
24:44:29:And this will be the sign to you, declares the Lord, that I will punish you in this place so that you may know that my threats of disaster against you will surely come to pass:
24:44:30:Behold, I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed over Zedekiah, king of Judah, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who sought his life."
24:45:1:At that time, when Baruch, the son of Neriah, wrote these words in a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah the prophet, this message came from the Lord:
24:45:2:This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
24:45:3:You have been saying, "Woe is me now! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and can find no rest."
24:45:4:Tell him this, says the Lord: I am going to tear down what I have built and uproot what I have planted throughout the land.
24:45:5:But as for you, do not seek great things for yourself. Do not pursue them, for I will bring disaster upon all people, declares the Lord. But wherever you go, I will grant you your life as a reward.
24:46:1:This is the message that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
24:46:2:About Egypt: This message concerns the army of Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah.
24:46:3:Prepare your shields, both large and small, and advance into battle!
24:46:4:Horses are harnessed, riders mount up, they take their positions with helmets gleaming; the spears are brandished, the armor shines.
24:46:5:What do I see? They're terrified, they're retreating, their warriors are defeated! They flee in haste without looking back, and there's terror all around," declares the Lord.
24:46:6:The swift cannot escape, nor the strong find refuge; in the north by the Euphrates River, they have stumbled and fallen.
24:46:7:Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters?
24:46:8:Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. It says, 'I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.'
24:46:9:Charge, O horses! Drive furiously, O charioteers! March on, O warriors—men of Cush and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia skilled in handling the bow!
24:46:10:But that day belongs to the Lord, the God of Hosts, a day of vengeance when He will take revenge on His foes. The sword will devour and be satisfied, drinking its fill of their blood, for the Lord, the God of Hosts, will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the Euphrates River.
24:46:11:Go up to Gilead and get balm, O Virgin Daughter of Egypt! In vain you try many remedies; there is no healing for you.
24:46:12:The nations have heard of your shame; your cries fill the earth. One warrior stumbles over another; both have fallen together.
24:46:13:This is the message that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt:
24:46:14:Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it in Memphis and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions and prepare, for the sword devours those around you.'
24:46:15:Why will your warriors be laid low? They cannot stand, for the Lord will push them down.
24:46:16:They will stumble repeatedly; they will fall over each other. They will say, 'Get up, let us go back to our own people and our native land, away from the sword of the oppressor.'
24:46:17:There they will exclaim, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has missed his opportunity.'
24:46:18:As surely as I live," declares the King, whose name is the Lord of Hosts, "one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains, like Carmel by the sea.
24:46:19:Pack your belongings for exile, you who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant.
24:46:20:Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly is coming against her from the north.
24:46:21:Even her mercenaries are like fattened calves. They too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of disaster is coming upon them, the time for them to be punished.
24:46:22:Egypt's voice will hiss like a fleeing serpent, for the enemy will advance in force; they will come against her with axes, like woodcutters.
24:46:23:They will cut down her forest," declares the Lord, "dense though it be. They are more numerous than locusts; they cannot be counted.
24:46:24:The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to the people of the north."
24:46:25:The Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes, on Pharaoh, on Egypt and her gods and her kings, and on those who rely on Pharaoh.
24:46:26:I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past," declares the Lord.
24:46:27:But do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.
24:46:28:Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, for I am with you," declares the Lord. "Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished."
24:47:1:This is the message from the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:
24:47:2:Thus says the Lord: "Behold, waters are rising out of the north, and they shall become an overflowing torrent. They will flood the land and everything in it, cities and their inhabitants. People will cry out, and all who dwell in the land will wail,
24:47:3:Hearing the thunderous noise of the stampeding hooves of his strong horses, the rumbling of his chariots, and the clatter of their wheels. Fathers, gripped by fear, won't turn back for their children, so weak will their hands be.
24:47:4:For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remains. Indeed, the Lord will destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the island of Caphtor.
24:47:5:Baldness will come upon Gaza, and Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourselves?
24:47:6:Alas, sword of the Lord, how long will you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath; rest and be still!
24:47:7:But how can it be quiet when the Lord has given it a command? Against Ashkelon and the seashore, there He has appointed it."
24:48:1:About Moab, this is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Woe to Nebo, for it is devastated! Kiriathaim is put to shame; it is captured. The fortress is disgraced and shattered.
24:48:2:Moab's glory is no more. In Heshbon they plot her downfall: 'Come, let's cut her off from being a nation!' You too, Madmen, will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.
24:48:3:A voice cries out from Horonaim, 'Devastation and great destruction!'
24:48:4:Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
24:48:5:As they climb up Luhith with tears streaming down their faces, on the way down to Horonaim, anguished cries over the destruction are heard.
24:48:6:Flee! Save your lives! Be like a bush in the desert.
24:48:7:Because you trusted in your strongholds and treasures, you will be captured. Chemosh will go into exile, along with his priests and officials.
24:48:8:The destroyer will come against every city, not one will escape. The valley will be ruined, and the high plateau will be devastated, as the Lord has said.
24:48:9:Give wings to Moab, for she will fly away. Her cities will become desolate, with no one living in them.
24:48:10:Cursed is the one who is lax in doing the Lord's work! Cursed is the one who keeps their sword from bloodshed!
24:48:11:Moab has been at ease since her youth; she has rested on her laurels and has never been emptied from vessel to vessel. She has never gone into exile, so her taste remains unchanged, and her aroma is undisturbed.
24:48:12:But the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will send men to pour her out; they will empty her vessels and shatter her jars.
24:48:13:Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
24:48:14:How can you say, 'We are warriors, valiant men ready for battle'?
24:48:15:Moab's destroyer will come, and her cities will rise up. Her finest young men will go down in the slaughter, declares the King, whose name is the Lord of Armies.
24:48:16:Calamity is near for Moab, and her doom is rushing swiftly.
24:48:17:Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, 'How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff!'
24:48:18:Come down from your glory, and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitant of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has destroyed your strongholds.
24:48:19:Stand by the road and watch, O inhabitant of Aroer! Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, 'What has happened?'
24:48:20:Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
24:48:21:Judgment has come upon the high plateau—upon Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,
24:48:22:Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim,
24:48:23:Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
24:48:24:Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.
24:48:25:The strength of Moab is shattered; her power is broken, declares the Lord.
24:48:26:Make her drunk, for she has defied the Lord. Let Moab wallow in her vomit, and let her be an object of ridicule.
24:48:27:Was not Israel an object of ridicule to you? Was she caught among thieves that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?
24:48:28:Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, O inhabitants of Moab! Be like a dove that nests at the mouth of a cave.
24:48:29:We have heard of Moab's pride—how very proud she is—of her arrogance, her insolence, and her unbridled heart.
24:48:30:I know her insolence well, declares the Lord, but her boasts are empty,
24:48:31:her deeds unworthy. Therefore, I will wail for Moab, and cry out for all of Moab; I will moan for the people of Kir-heres.
24:48:32:With more than the weeping of Jazer, I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches spread over the sea, reaching as far as Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripe fruit and grapes.
24:48:33:Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful land of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy.
24:48:34:The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.
24:48:35:In Moab, I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods, declares the Lord.
24:48:36:Therefore, my heart laments for Moab like a flute; it laments for the people of Kir-heres like a flute. For the wealth they acquired has perished.
24:48:37:Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off. On all the hands are gashes, and around the waist is sackcloth.
24:48:38:On all the housetops of Moab and in its public squares, there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants, declares the Lord.
24:48:39:How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, a horror to all those around her.
24:48:40:This is what the Lord says: Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.
24:48:41:Kerioth will be captured, and the strongholds will be seized. In that day, the hearts of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24:48:42:Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the Lord.
24:48:43:Terror, pit, and snare await you, O people of Moab, declares the Lord.
24:48:44:Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab, the year of their punishment, declares the Lord.
24:48:45:In the shadow of Heshbon, fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it consumes the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.
24:48:46:Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.
24:48:47:Yet, in days to come, I will restore the fortunes of Moab, declares the Lord. This is the judgment on Moab.
24:49:1:Concerning the Ammonites, this is what the Lord says: "Has Israel lost its children? Why has their king taken over Gad's territory and settled in its cities?
24:49:2:So listen, I, the Lord, declare that I will bring terror upon the city of Rabbah, turning it into a desolate ruin. Its neighboring villages will be set on fire, and Israel will reclaim its stolen land," says the Lord.
24:49:3:Weep, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! Cry out, inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run to and fro within your walls, for your god Milcom will be taken into exile, along with his priests and officials.
24:49:4:Why do you boast in your valleys, O faithless daughter? You trust in your riches, thinking, 'Who can come against me?'
24:49:5:I will bring fear upon you from every side," declares the Lord God of Hosts. "You will be scattered, each one fleeing before the enemy, and no one will gather the fugitives.
24:49:6:But afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites," says the Lord.
24:49:7:About Edom, this is what the Lord Almighty says: "Is there no more wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed?
24:49:8:Flee, turn back, hide in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan! For I will bring disaster upon Esau at the time when I punish him.
24:49:9:If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings? If thieves came by night, they would destroy only what they wanted.
24:49:10:But I have stripped Esau bare; I have uncovered his hiding places, and he is unable to conceal himself. His offspring, relatives, and neighbors are destroyed, and he is no more.
24:49:11:Leave your orphans behind, and I will keep them alive; let your widows trust in me."
24:49:12:For this is what the Lord says: "If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished but must drink it too.
24:49:13:I swear by myself," declares the Lord, "that Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse; and all its cities will be everlasting ruins."
24:49:14:I have heard a message from the Lord; an envoy has been sent among the nations: "Assemble! Attack Edom! Prepare for battle!"
24:49:15:I will make you small among the nations, despised by mankind.
24:49:16:The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, O dweller in the clefts of the rock, who occupies the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down," declares the Lord.
24:49:17:Edom will become an object of horror; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all its wounds.
24:49:18:It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns," says the Lord. "No one will live there; no one will dwell in it.
24:49:19:Look! An enemy swoops down like an eagle, spreading his wings over Bozrah. In that day, the hearts of Edom's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24:49:20:About Damascus: "Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, for they have heard bad news. They are disheartened, troubled like the restless sea.
24:49:21:Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee and panic has seized her. Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, like a woman in labor.
24:49:22:Her young men will fall in the streets, and all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," declares the Lord Almighty.
24:49:23:About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked: This is what the Lord says: "Arise, go up against Kedar and destroy the people of the east!
24:49:24:Take their tents and their flocks, their curtains and all their goods; carry off their camels for yourselves, and call out to them, 'Terror on every side!'
24:49:25:Flee quickly, stay in remote places
24:49:26:For this is what the Lord says: "Hazor will become a desolate place, a haunt for jackals; no one will live there, and no one will dwell in it."
24:49:27:A message came to Jeremiah from the Lord concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the Lord Almighty says:
24:49:28:"I will break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might.
24:49:29:I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens and scatter them to all those winds. There will be no nation where Elam's exiles do not go.
24:49:30:I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who want to kill them; I will bring disaster upon them, even my fierce anger," declares the Lord. "I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.
24:49:31:I will set my throne in Elam and destroy her king and officials," declares the Lord.
24:49:32:"Yet in the future, I will restore the fortunes of Elam," says the Lord.
24:50:1:The word that the LORD spoke about Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, came through Jeremiah the prophet.
24:50:2:Declare among the nations and announce it; raise a banner and proclaim it. Do not conceal anything, but say, 'Babylon has been captured; Bel is put to shame, and Marduk is shattered. Her idols are disgraced, and her images are broken.'
24:50:3:A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste to her land. No one will live there; both people and animals will flee.
24:50:4:In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, the people of Israel and the people of Judah will come together, weeping as they go, and they will seek the LORD their God.
24:50:5:They will ask the way to Zion, with their faces turned toward it, saying, 'Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.'
24:50:6:My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds led them astray, causing them to roam on the mountains. They wandered from mountain to hill; they forgot their resting place.
24:50:7:All who found them devoured them, and their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the hope of their ancestors.'
24:50:8:Flee from Babylon! Escape for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the LORD's vengeance; he will repay her what she deserves.
24:50:9:For I will stir up and bring against Babylon a company of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed.
24:50:10:Babylon will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill, declares the LORD.
24:50:11:Though you rejoice and are glad, O destroyer of my heritage, though you frolic like a heifer in the grass and neigh like stallions, your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who bore you will be disgraced.
24:50:12:See, your homeland will become a desolate waste, a desert where no one lives.
24:50:13:Because of the LORD's wrath, Babylon will be uninhabited; it will become a desolation, a wasteland. All who pass by Babylon will be horrified and scoff at its wounds.
24:50:14:Take up positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD.
24:50:15:Shout against her on every side! She surrenders; her towers fall, her walls are torn down. This is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.
24:50:16:Cut off from Babylon the sower and the reaper with his sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor's sword, everyone will turn to their own people and flee to their own land.
24:50:17:Israel is a scattered flock, driven away by lions. First, the king of Assyria devoured them; now, at last, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has crushed their bones.
24:50:18:Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.
24:50:19:But I will bring Israel back to their own pasture, and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan; their appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
24:50:20:In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare.
24:50:21:Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them, declares the LORD. Do everything I have commanded you.
24:50:22:The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction.
24:50:23:How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
24:50:24:I set a trap for you, Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were discovered and seized because you opposed the LORD.
24:50:25:The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
24:50:26:Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave nothing behind.
24:50:27:Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them, for their day has come, the time for them to be punished.
24:50:28:Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple.
24:50:29:Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
24:50:30:Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day, declares the LORD.
24:50:31:See, I am against you, arrogant one, declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
24:50:32:The arrogant one will stumble and fall, with no one to pick him up. I will kindle a fire in his cities that will consume everything around him.
24:50:33:This is what the LORD Almighty says: The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go.
24:50:34:Yet their Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon.
24:50:35:A sword against the Babylonians! declares the LORD—against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men!
24:50:36:A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.
24:50:37:A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become weaklings. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.
24:50:38:A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, and they are mad over terrifying images.
24:50:39:Therefore, desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.
24:50:40:As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns, declares the LORD, so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it.
24:50:41:Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24:50:42:They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Babylon.
24:50:43:The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
24:50:44:Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?
24:50:45:Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate.
24:50:46:At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.
24:51:1:The Lord says, "I will rise against Babylon and the people who live in Leb Kamai, bringing destruction upon them.
24:51:2:I will send foreigners to Babylon, like a wind blowing away chaff, turning her into a desolate ruin.
24:51:3:They will surround Babylon with their weapons, attacking from all sides, so no one can escape.
24:51:4:Her defenders will be overwhelmed, their bows broken; for the Lord is a God of vengeance, repaying what is due.
24:51:5:Babylon has reached up to the heavens, but her judgment has not been withheld; she will be repaid for her sins.
24:51:6:Flee from Babylon! Save your lives, so you won't be destroyed by her punishment, for this is the Lord's time of vengeance.
24:51:7:Babylon was once a golden cup in the Lord's hand, intoxicating the whole earth; nations drank her wine and went mad.
24:51:8:Suddenly, Babylon falls and is shattered. Mourn for her, and bring healing balm for her pain, if perhaps she can be healed.
24:51:9:We tried to heal Babylon, but she cannot be cured. Let us leave her and return to our own land, for her judgment reaches the skies.
24:51:10:The Lord has vindicated us; let's proclaim it in Zion, declaring that he has avenged the desecration of his temple.
24:51:11:Sharpen the arrows and fill the quivers! The Lord will stir up the spirit of the kings of Media, for his plan is against Babylon to destroy it, fulfilling his vengeance.
24:51:12:Set up a signal on the walls of Babylon, strengthen the guard, post sentries, and prepare ambushes; for the Lord has planned and will carry out his purpose against the people of Babylon.
24:51:13:You who live by great waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, and the thread of your life is cut.
24:51:14:The Lord Almighty has sworn by himself: "I will fill you with enemies like a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you."
24:51:15:He made the earth by his power, established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24:51:16:When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar, and he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
24:51:17:Every man is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are frauds, with no breath in them.
24:51:18:They are worthless, objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.
24:51:19:But the God of Israel is not like them; he is the Creator of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. The Lord Almighty is his name.
24:51:20:"You are my war club, my weapon for battle. With you, I shatter nations and destroy kingdoms.
24:51:21:With you, I shatter horse and rider, chariot and driver.
24:51:22:With you, I shatter man and woman, old and young, shepherd and flock.
24:51:23:With you, I shatter farmer and oxen, governor and official.
24:51:24:Before your eyes, I will repay Babylon and its people for all the wrong they have done in Zion," declares the Lord.
24:51:25:"I am against you, destroying mountain, that destroys the whole earth," declares the Lord. "I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain.
24:51:26:No one will use your stones for a cornerstone or lay a foundation, for you will be desolate forever," says the Lord.
24:51:27:Set up a signal in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her; summon kingdoms against her—Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her; bring up horses like a swarm of locusts.
24:51:28:Prepare the nations for battle against her—the kings of Media, their governors and officials, and all their people under their rule.
24:51:29:The earth trembles and writhes, for the Lord's purpose against Babylon stands: to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitants.
24:51:30:Babylon's warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become weak, for the Lord has brought judgment upon them.
24:51:31:Look! A messenger races to meet another, and a herald to meet another, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end.
24:51:32:The river crossings are seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers are terrified.
24:51:33:For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; yet a little while, and the time of her harvest will come."
24:51:34:Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has devoured us, crushed us, and left us an empty shell. He swallowed us like a monster, filled his belly with our riches, and then vomited us out.
24:51:35:May the violence done to our people and the plunder of our land be repaid to Babylon," say the inhabitants of Zion.
24:51:36:Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs run dry.
24:51:37:Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt for jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives.
24:51:38:Her people will roar together like young lions; they will growl like lion cubs.
24:51:39:While they are inflamed with wine, I will prepare a feast for them and make them drunk, so they may revel and sleep a perpetual sleep, never to awaken," declares the Lord.
24:51:40:"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats.
24:51:41:"How Sheshach is captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! How desolate is Babylon among the nations!
24:51:42:The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered by its tumultuous waves.
24:51:43:Her cities have become an object of horror, a dry and desert land, where no one lives, and through which no one travels.
24:51:44:I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him disgorge what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him, and the wall of Babylon will fall.
24:51:45:Come out of her, my people! Save yourselves from the fierce anger of the Lord.
24:51:46:Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.
24:51:47:For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced, and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
24:51:48:Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her," declares the Lord.
24:51:49:Babylon must fall because of the slain of Israel, just as the slain of all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
24:51:50:You who have escaped the sword, go and do not linger! Remember the Lord in a distant land, and call to mind Jerusalem.
24:51:51:We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the Lord's temple.
24:51:52:"But the days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
24:51:53:Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her," declares the Lord.
24:51:54:Listen! A cry comes from Babylon, a great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
24:51:55:The Lord will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound.
24:51:56:A destroyer will come upon Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the Lord is a God of retribution; he will repay in full.
24:51:57:I will make her officials and wise men drunk, along with her governors, officers, and warriors. They will sleep forever and not awake," declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.
24:51:58:This is what the Lord Almighty says: "Babylon's thick walls will be leveled, and her high gates set on fire. The people exhaust themselves for nothing; the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames."
24:51:59:This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign.
24:51:60:Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon.
24:51:61:He said to Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.
24:51:62:Then say, 'Lord, you have said you will destroy this place so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.'
24:51:63:When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates.
24:51:64:Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.'" The words of Jeremiah end here.
24:52:1:Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
24:52:2:He did what was evil in the Lord's sight, just as Jehoiakim had done.
24:52:3:Because of the Lord's anger, these terrible things happened to Jerusalem and Judah until he finally banished them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24:52:4:In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They surrounded the city and built siege ramps against its walls.
24:52:5:The city was under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year as king.
24:52:6:On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city became so severe that there was no food left for the people.
24:52:7:Then the Babylonians broke through the city walls, and all the soldiers fled. They left the city during the night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,
24:52:8:but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his troops were scattered.
24:52:9:They captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where a sentence was pronounced upon him.
24:52:10:There at Riblah, the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah's sons before his very eyes. He also killed all the officials of Judah.
24:52:11:Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him in bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon, where he remained a prisoner until his death.
24:52:12:On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, commander of the imperial guard, came to Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon.
24:52:13:He burned down the temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building was destroyed by fire.
24:52:14:The Babylonian troops broke down the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
24:52:15:Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, deported some of the poorest people, along with the rest of the population who had remained in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the remaining craftsmen.
24:52:16:But Nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind to work the vineyards and fields.
24:52:17:The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands, and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24:52:18:They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the other bronze articles used in the temple service.
24:52:19:The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes, and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
24:52:20:The two pillars, the one Sea, and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord, were of such great value that their weight could not be determined.
24:52:21:Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. They were hollow, with a thickness of four fingers.
24:52:22:The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its network, was similar.
24:52:23:There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, with a total of one hundred pomegranates above the surrounding network.
24:52:24:The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three doorkeepers.
24:52:25:He also took from the city a eunuch who was in charge of the fighting men, seven royal advisors, the secretary to the commander of the army who enlisted the people for military service, and sixty other citizens.
24:52:26:Nebuzaradan, the commander, took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24:52:27:There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its land.
24:52:28:This is the number of people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: In his seventh year, he took 3,023 Jews.
24:52:29:In his eighteenth year, Nebuchadnezzar took 832 people from Jerusalem.
24:52:30:In his twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, took 745 more Jews into exile. In total, there were 4,600 people taken into exile.
24:52:31:In the thirty-seventh year after King Jehoiachin of Judah had been taken prisoner, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Evil-Merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.
24:52:32:He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
24:52:33:Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and ate regularly at the king's table for the rest of his life.
24:52:34:The king of Babylon provided Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.
