54:1:1:From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus appointed by God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope.
54:1:2:To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
54:1:3:As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay in Ephesus to instruct certain individuals not to teach false doctrines,
54:1:4:nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which lead to pointless speculation rather than furthering God's work, which is based on faith.
54:1:5:The goal of this instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.
54:1:6:Some people have deviated from these principles and turned to meaningless talk,
54:1:7:wanting to be teachers of the law but not understanding what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
54:1:8:We know that the law is good if it is used properly,
54:1:9:recognizing that it is not meant for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, ungodly and sinful people, unholy and irreligious individuals, those who kill their parents, murderers,
54:1:10:sexually immoral, homosexuals, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and anyone else who opposes sound teaching,
54:1:11:in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which has been entrusted to me.
54:1:12:I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me trustworthy and appointed me to his service,
54:1:13:although I was once a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I received mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief,
54:1:14:and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
54:1:15:This is a trustworthy saying, deserving full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
54:1:16:But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
54:1:17:Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
54:1:18:Timothy, my child, I entrust you with this responsibility in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them, you may fight the good fight,
54:1:19:holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
54:1:20:Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
54:2:1:First of all, I encourage you to offer prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings on behalf of everyone,
54:2:2:especially for rulers and those in authority, so that we may live peaceful and quiet lives with godliness and dignity.
54:2:3:This is good and pleases our Savior God,
54:2:4:who wants everyone to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.
54:2:5:For there is one God and one mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus,
54:2:6:who gave himself as a ransom for all people—a testimony given at the right time.
54:2:7:I was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a faithful teacher of this truth among the Gentiles; I speak the truth in Christ and do not lie.
54:2:8:So, I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.
54:2:9:Similarly, women should dress modestly, with decency and self-control, not adorning themselves with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,
54:2:10:but with good deeds, which are fitting for women who profess devotion to God.
54:2:11:A woman should learn quietly and submissively,
54:2:12:not being allowed to teach or assume authority over a man; she must remain silent.
54:2:13:For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
54:2:14:And it wasn't Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
54:2:15:However, women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, along with self-control.
54:3:1:Here's a trustworthy saying: if someone aspires to be a leader in the church, they desire a noble task.
54:3:2:So, a church leader must be beyond reproach, faithful to their spouse, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, and able to teach.
54:3:3:They shouldn't be addicted to alcohol or prone to violence; instead, they should be gentle, peaceable, and not greedy for money.
54:3:4:A good leader manages their own household well, keeping their children under control with proper respect.
54:3:5:For if someone can't manage their own family, how can they take care of God's church?
54:3:6:New believers shouldn't be appointed as leaders, so they won't become conceited and fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
54:3:7:Moreover, a leader must have a good reputation among outsiders, so they won't be disgraced and fall into the devil's trap.
54:3:8:In the same way, deacons should be dignified, honest in speech, not addicted to much wine, and not greedy for dishonest gain.
54:3:9:They must hold firmly to the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
54:3:10:Deacons should first be tested and proven blameless before they serve.
54:3:11:Similarly, women serving in the church should be dignified, not slanderers, but self-controlled and faithful in everything.
54:3:12:Deacons must be faithful to their spouses and manage their children and households well.
54:3:13:Those who serve well as deacons gain an honorable standing and great confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.
54:3:14:I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon.
54:3:15:But if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
54:3:16:Without a doubt, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
54:4:1:In later times, some people will abandon the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons.
54:4:2:These false teachings come from liars whose consciences have been seared as if with a hot iron.
54:4:3:They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from certain foods, which God created to be enjoyed with thankfulness by those who believe and know the truth.
54:4:4:For everything created by God is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with gratitude,
54:4:5:because it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
54:4:6:By sharing these instructions with the believers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and the good teaching that you have followed.
54:4:7:Avoid godless myths and old wives' tales; instead, train yourself to be godly.
54:4:8:Physical exercise has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
54:4:9:This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.
54:4:10:For this reason we labor and strive, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
54:4:11:Command and teach these things.
54:4:12:Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
54:4:13:Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching, and to teaching.
54:4:14:Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
54:4:15:Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.
54:4:16:Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
54:5:1:Show respect to older men as you would to your own father, and treat younger men like your brothers.
54:5:2:Treat older women as you would your mother, and younger women as your sisters, with absolute purity.
54:5:3:Take care of widows who are truly in need.
54:5:4:But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to take care of their own family and repay their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
54:5:5:The widow who is truly alone, with no one to rely on, puts her hope in God and continues in prayer day and night.
54:5:6:However, a widow who lives for pleasure is spiritually dead even while she is still alive.
54:5:7:Give these instructions to the believers so that they may be above reproach.
54:5:8:If someone does not provide for their own relatives, especially those in their immediate family, they have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever.
54:5:9:Enroll a widow in the support list only if she is over sixty years old, has been the wife of one husband,
54:5:10:and is known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble, and devoting herself to all kinds of good works.
54:5:11:Do not enroll younger widows, for when their desires lead them away from Christ, they want to marry again,
54:5:12:and thus they bring judgment upon themselves because they have broken their first pledge.
54:5:13:Moreover, they become idle and get into the habit of going from house to house; and not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they should not.
54:5:14:So I advise younger widows to marry, have children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
54:5:15:For some have already turned away to follow Satan.
54:5:16:If any believing woman has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are truly in need.
54:5:17:Elders who lead well should be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
54:5:18:For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and "The worker deserves his wages."
54:5:19:Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
54:5:20:Those who sin should be rebuked publicly, so that others may take warning.
54:5:21:I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing out of favoritism.
54:5:22:Do not be hasty in laying on hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
54:5:23:Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent illnesses.
54:5:24:The sins of some people are obvious, leading them to judgment, but the sins of others trail behind them.
54:5:25:In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.
54:6:1:All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God's name and our teaching may not be slandered.
54:6:2:Those who have believing masters should not disrespect them because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves.
54:6:3:If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that promotes godliness,
54:6:4:they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,
54:6:5:and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
54:6:6:But true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth.
54:6:7:For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it.
54:6:8:So if we have food and clothing, let us be content with these.
54:6:9:But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a trap, and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
54:6:10:For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
54:6:11:But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
54:6:12:Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
54:6:13:I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
54:6:14:to keep this commandment without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
54:6:15:which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
54:6:16:who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
54:6:17:Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
54:6:18:Encourage them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.
54:6:19:In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
54:6:20:Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,
54:6:21:which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you all.
