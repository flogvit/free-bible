66:1:1:The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
66:1:2:who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
66:1:3:Blessed are those who read aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
66:1:4:John, to the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,
66:1:5:and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
66:1:6:and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
66:1:7:Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.
66:1:8:"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."
66:1:9:I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66:1:10:On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
66:1:11:saying, "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."
66:1:12:I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
66:1:13:and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
66:1:14:His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
66:1:15:His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
66:1:16:In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
66:1:17:When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
66:1:18:I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
66:1:19:Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.
66:1:20:The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
66:2:1:To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write this message: "The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things:
66:2:2:I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance. I also know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, and you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them to be false.
66:2:3:You have shown great endurance and have suffered for My name's sake without growing weary.
66:2:4:However, I have a concern about you: you have left your first love.
66:2:5:Remember how far you have fallen! Repent and return to the works you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
66:2:6:But you do have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also despise.
66:2:7:Let anyone with ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66:2:8:Now to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write this: "The First and the Last, who died and came back to life, says these things:
66:2:9:I know your afflictions and your poverty—though you are actually rich—and the slander of those who say they are Jews but are not, for they are a synagogue of Satan.
66:2:10:Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will face persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66:2:11:Let anyone with ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.
66:2:12:To the angel of the church in Pergamum, write this: "The One who has the sharp, double-edged sword says these things:
66:2:13:I know where you live—where Satan's throne is. Yet you remain true to My name. You did not renounce your faith in Me, even when Antipas, my faithful witness, was put to death in your city, where Satan lives.
66:2:14:Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have some people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to lead the Israelites into sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and committing sexual immorality.
66:2:15:In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teachings of the Nicolaitans.
66:2:16:Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth.
66:2:17:Let anyone with ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give hidden manna and a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.
66:2:18:And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write this: "The Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze, says these things:
66:2:19:I know your deeds, your love, your faith, your service, and your perseverance, and that your recent deeds are greater than your first ones.
66:2:20:However, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching, she leads My servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
66:2:21:I have given her time to repent, but she refuses to turn away from her immorality.
66:2:22:So I will cast her onto a bed of suffering, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent of their deeds.
66:2:23:I will also strike her followers with deadly disease, and then all the churches will know that I am the One who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
66:2:24:But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold to her teachings and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, I will not impose any other burden on you.
66:2:25:Just hold on to what you have until I come.
66:2:26:To the one who conquers and continues in My works until the end, I will give authority over the nations.
66:2:27:They will rule them with an iron scepter and shatter them like pottery, just as I have received authority from My Father.
66:2:28:I will also give them the morning star.
66:2:29:Let anyone with ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:1:Write to the angel of the church in Sardis: The One who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this: I know your deeds; you have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.
66:3:2:Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.
66:3:3:Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
66:3:4:Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
66:3:5:The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out their name from the book of life, but will acknowledge their name before my Father and his angels.
66:3:6:Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:7:To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, who holds the key of David. When he opens, no one can shut; when he shuts, no one can open.
66:3:8:I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. You have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66:3:9:I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are lying—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
66:3:10:Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
66:3:11:I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
66:3:12:The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.
66:3:13:Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:3:14:To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Originator of God’s creation, says this:
66:3:15:I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
66:3:16:So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66:3:17:You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
66:3:18:I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
66:3:19:Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
66:3:20:Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
66:3:21:To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66:3:22:Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66:4:1:After this, I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven. The voice that first spoke to me, like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things."
66:4:2:Instantly, I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
66:4:3:The One seated on the throne appeared like jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald.
66:4:4:Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white robes with golden crowns on their heads.
66:4:5:From the central throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing, which are the seven spirits of God.
66:4:6:Also in front of the throne, there appeared to be a sea of glass, clear as crystal. Around the throne, on each side, were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and behind.
66:4:7:The first creature resembled a lion, the second one looked like an ox, the third had a face like a human, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
66:4:8:Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."
66:4:9:Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
66:4:10:The twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say,
66:4:11:"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and power, for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created."
66:5:1:Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one seated on the throne. The scroll had writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals.
66:5:2:Next, I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?"
66:5:3:But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
66:5:4:I wept bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
66:5:5:However, one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."
66:5:6:In the center of the throne and the four living creatures, and among the elders, I saw a Lamb that appeared to have been slain. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66:5:7:The Lamb approached the one seated on the throne and took the scroll from his right hand.
66:5:8:When the Lamb took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before him. Each one had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, representing the prayers of God's people.
66:5:9:They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you purchased people for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
66:5:10:You have made them a kingdom and priests for our God, and they will reign on the earth."
66:5:11:Then I looked and heard the voices of many angels surrounding the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. Their number was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands upon thousands.
66:5:12:They proclaimed in a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!"
66:5:13:And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the sea, as well as all that is in them, saying, "To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be praise, honor, glory, and power forever and ever!"
66:5:14:The four living creatures responded, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66:6:1:The Lamb opened the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, "Come!"
66:6:2:Then I looked, and there before me was a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown; he rode out as a conqueror, determined to conquer.
66:6:3:When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
66:6:4:A fiery red horse appeared, and its rider was granted the power to take peace from the earth and cause people to kill each other. He was given a large sword.
66:6:5:As the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse. Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand.
66:6:6:Then I heard a voice among the four living creatures say, "A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and three quarts of barley for a day's wages, but do not damage the oil and the wine."
66:6:7:Afterward, when the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
66:6:8:I saw a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, with Hades following close behind. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and wild beasts.
66:6:9:As the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and their testimony.
66:6:10:They cried out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge those who live on the earth and avenge our blood?"
66:6:11:Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer until the full number of their fellow servants and brothers had been killed, just as they had been.
66:6:12:I watched as the Lamb opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake, the sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, and the whole moon became like blood.
66:6:13:The stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.
66:6:14:The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
66:6:15:The kings of the earth, the nobles, the commanders, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and free person hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66:6:16:They called to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!"
66:6:17:For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?
66:7:1:After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth, preventing any wind from blowing on the land or the sea or against any tree.
66:7:2:Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. He shouted to the four angels who had been given power to harm the earth and the sea,
66:7:3:saying, "Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
66:7:4:And I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel were sealed.
66:7:5:From the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed; from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000; from the tribe of Gad, 12,000;
66:7:6:from the tribe of Asher, 12,000; from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000; from the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000;
66:7:7:from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000; from the tribe of Levi, 12,000; from the tribe of Issachar, 12,000;
66:7:8:from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000; from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000; and from the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.
66:7:9:After this, I looked and saw a vast multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
66:7:10:They shouted with a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
66:7:11:All the angels were standing around the throne, along with the elders and the four living creatures. They fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God,
66:7:12:saying, "Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength be to our God forever and ever! Amen."
66:7:13:Then one of the elders asked me, "Who are these dressed in white robes, and where did they come from?"
66:7:14:I answered, "Sir, you know." He said to me, "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66:7:15:That's why they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and the one who sits on the throne will shelter them.
66:7:16:They will never again be hungry or thirsty; the sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.
66:7:17:For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66:8:1:When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66:8:2:Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
66:8:3:Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer. He was given a large amount of incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar in front of the throne.
66:8:4:The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the angel's hand.
66:8:5:After that, the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it onto the earth. There were rumblings, peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
66:8:6:Now the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
66:8:7:The first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were consumed, and all the green grass was destroyed.
66:8:8:Next, the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,
66:8:9:a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66:8:10:Following this, the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky onto a third of the rivers and the springs of water.
66:8:11:The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the poisoned waters.
66:8:12:Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, along with a third of the moon and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
66:8:13:As I looked, I heard an eagle flying overhead, calling out in a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!"
66:9:1:The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.
66:9:2:When the star opened the pit, smoke rose from it like the smoke of a huge furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.
66:9:3:Out of the smoke came locusts that spread over the earth. They were given power like scorpions have on earth.
66:9:4:These locusts were commanded not to harm the grass, plants, or trees, but only those people who didn't have God's seal on their foreheads.
66:9:5:They weren't allowed to kill them, just to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the sting of a scorpion.
66:9:6:During those days, people will seek death but won't find it; they'll long to die, but death will elude them.
66:9:7:The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads, they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
66:9:8:Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.
66:9:9:They had breastplates that seemed like iron, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many chariots rushing into battle.
66:9:10:They had tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails, they had the power to hurt people for five months.
66:9:11:They had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, he is called Apollyon.
66:9:12:The first woe has passed; behold, two more woes are still to come.
66:9:13:Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God.
66:9:14:The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66:9:15:So the four angels who had been prepared for this hour, day, month, and year were released to kill a third of humanity.
66:9:16:The number of mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand; I heard their count.
66:9:17:In my vision, I saw the horses and their riders: they wore fiery red, dark blue, and yellow breastplates. The horses' heads resembled lions', and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.
66:9:18:A third of humanity was killed by these three plagues—the fire, smoke, and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
66:9:19:The power of the horses was in their mouths and their tails, for their tails were like serpents with heads, and with them, they inflicted harm.
66:9:20:Despite these plagues, the rest of humanity who were not killed didn't repent of their deeds or stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—things that cannot see, hear, or walk.
66:9:21:They did not repent of their murders, sorceries, sexual immorality, or thefts.
66:10:1:Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.
66:10:2:He held a small open scroll in his hand, and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.
66:10:3:He shouted with a voice like a roaring lion, and when he did, seven thunders sounded their voices.
66:10:4:After the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write down what they said, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down."
66:10:5:The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand to the sky,
66:10:6:and swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens, earth, and everything in them, that there would be no more delay.
66:10:7:Instead, when the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God's hidden plan will be completed, as He announced to His servants the prophets.
66:10:8:Then the voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land."
66:10:9:I approached the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will taste sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will turn bitter in your stomach."
66:10:10:I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter.
66:10:11:Then the angel told me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66:11:1:Then I was given a measuring rod, similar to a staff, and I was told, "Go and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.
66:11:2:But leave out the outer courtyard; don't measure it, because it has been given to the non-believers. They will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
66:11:3:I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth."
66:11:4:These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66:11:5:If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
66:11:6:They have the power to shut the sky so that no rain falls during the time they are prophesying; they also have power over waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
66:11:7:When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will wage war against them, overpower, and kill them.
66:11:8:Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66:11:9:People from every tribe, language, and nation will gaze at their dead bodies for three and a half days, refusing to let them be buried.
66:11:10:The inhabitants of the earth will rejoice over them, celebrate, and exchange gifts, because these two prophets had tormented them.
66:11:11:But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell upon those who saw them.
66:11:12:Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Come up here." They ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
66:11:13:At that moment, there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66:11:14:The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming soon.
66:11:15:The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."
66:11:16:The twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped Him,
66:11:17:saying, "We give thanks to You, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and begun to reign.
66:11:18:The nations were angry, but Your wrath has come, along with the time to judge the dead, reward Your servants the prophets and saints, and those who fear Your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
66:11:19:Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.
66:12:1:A great sign appeared in the sky: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
66:12:2:She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
66:12:3:Then another sign appeared in the sky: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on each head a diadem.
66:12:4:Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, ready to devour her child as soon as it was born.
66:12:5:She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. Her child was snatched up to God and his throne.
66:12:6:The woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her to be nourished for 1,260 days.
66:12:7:War broke out in heaven, with Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back,
66:12:8:but they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
66:12:9:The great dragon, that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray, was hurled down to the earth, along with its angels.
66:12:10:Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been thrown down.
66:12:11:They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
66:12:12:Therefore, rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, knowing that his time is short."
66:12:13:When the dragon saw that it had been hurled to the earth, it pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66:12:14:But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so she could fly to her place in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time, safe from the serpent.
66:12:15:Then from its mouth, the serpent spewed water like a river, trying to overtake the woman and sweep her away in the torrent.
66:12:16:But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out.
66:12:17:Enraged at this, the dragon went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God's commands and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus.
66:13:1:Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, each with a blasphemous name on it.
66:13:2:This creature resembled a leopard, but had feet like a bear's and a mouth like a lion's. The dragon gave the beast its power, throne, and great authority.
66:13:3:One of its heads seemed fatally wounded, but the deadly wound was healed. The whole world marveled at this and followed the beast.
66:13:4:People worshiped the dragon for giving power to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast, asking, "Who is as mighty as the beast? Who can fight against it?"
66:13:5:The beast was given a mouth that spoke arrogant and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.
66:13:6:It opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God, cursing His name, His dwelling place, and those who live in heaven.
66:13:7:It was granted power to wage war against the saints and conquer them, and it received authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.
66:13:8:All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast, except those whose names have been written in the Lamb's Book of Life since the creation of the world.
66:13:9:If anyone has ears, let them hear:
66:13:10:Those destined for captivity will go into captivity; those destined to die by the sword will die by the sword. This calls for endurance and faithfulness from the saints.
66:13:11:Next, I saw another beast coming up from the earth. It had two horns like a lamb but spoke like a dragon.
66:13:12:It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, making the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose deadly wound had been healed.
66:13:13:It performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of the people.
66:13:14:Through these signs, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth, telling them to make an image in honor of the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
66:13:15:It was given power to breathe life into the image of the beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed.
66:13:16:It forced everyone—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to receive a mark on their right hand or forehead.
66:13:17:No one could buy or sell anything unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
66:13:18:This calls for wisdom. Let those with understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
66:14:1:Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66:14:2:I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
66:14:3:And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66:14:4:These are the ones who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
66:14:5:No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
66:14:6:Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people.
66:14:7:He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water."
66:14:8:A second angel followed and said, "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries."
66:14:9:A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,
66:14:10:they, too, will drink the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
66:14:11:And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name."
66:14:12:This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
66:14:13:Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them."
66:14:14:I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
66:14:15:Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66:14:16:So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
66:14:17:Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
66:14:18:Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe."
66:14:19:The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.
66:14:20:They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
66:15:1:Then I saw another great and amazing sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues, which bring an end to God's wrath.
66:15:2:And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had triumphed over the beast, its image, and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass, holding harps given to them by God.
66:15:3:They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations!
66:15:4:Who will not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."
66:15:5:After this, I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened.
66:15:6:The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple, dressed in clean, shining linen, and wearing golden sashes around their chests.
66:15:7:Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
66:15:8:The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
66:16:1:The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, causing terrible and painful sores to break out on those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
66:16:2:Next, the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, turning it to blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.
66:16:3:Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they also turned to blood.
66:16:4:I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are just in your judgments, O Holy One, who is and who was, because you have judged these things."
66:16:5:They shed the blood of saints and prophets, so you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.
66:16:6:I heard another voice from the altar say, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."
66:16:7:Afterward, the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, which was allowed to scorch people with fire.
66:16:8:People were scorched by intense heat, yet they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues. They did not repent or give him glory.
66:16:9:Following this, the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, plunging its kingdom into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony
66:16:10:and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. But they still refused to repent of their deeds.
66:16:11:Subsequently, the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, drying up its water to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66:16:12:I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come from the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.
66:16:13:These demonic spirits perform signs and gather the kings of the whole world for battle on the great day of God Almighty.
66:16:14:"Look, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed."
66:16:15:Then the spirits gathered the kings together at the place called in Hebrew Armageddon.
66:16:16:Finally, the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came from the throne in the temple saying, "It is done!"
66:16:17:There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a severe earthquake unlike any since humanity began, so great was its magnitude.
66:16:18:The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of his fierce wrath.
66:16:19:Every island fled away, and the mountains could not be found.
66:16:20:Enormous hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell from the sky on people, who cursed God because of the hail's extreme severity.
66:17:1:One day, an angel came to me and said, "Come with me, and I'll show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters.
66:17:2:The kings of the earth have committed immoral acts with her, and the people who live on earth have been intoxicated by the wine of her immorality."
66:17:3:So the angel took me away in the Spirit to a desolate place. There, I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns, covered with blasphemous names.
66:17:4:The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand, she held a golden cup filled with abominations and the filth of her immorality.
66:17:5:On her forehead, a mysterious name was written: "Babylon the Great, Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth."
66:17:6:I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I was utterly astonished.
66:17:7:Then the angel asked me, "Why are you so amazed? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
66:17:8:The beast, which you saw, once existed but now does not. It is about to come up from the abyss and go to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names haven't been written in the Book of Life since the creation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast because it once existed, now does not, but will come again.
66:17:9:Here's wisdom for those who have understanding: The seven heads represent seven hills on which the woman sits.
66:17:10:They also represent seven kings. Five of them have fallen, one is currently reigning, and the other has not yet come. When he does come, he must remain for only a short time.
66:17:11:As for the beast that once existed but now does not, it is an eighth king. It belongs to the seven and is heading for destruction.
66:17:12:The ten horns you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour, along with the beast.
66:17:13:These kings have one purpose: to give their power and authority to the beast.
66:17:14:Together, they will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful will stand with him."
66:17:15:Then the angel said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
66:17:16:The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will strip her naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
66:17:17:For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.
66:17:18:As for the woman you saw, she represents the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."
66:18:1:After these things, I saw another angel descending from heaven, possessing great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
66:18:2:He cried out powerfully with a loud voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a home for every unclean and detestable beast.
66:18:3:For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed adultery with her. The merchants of the earth have grown wealthy through the extravagance of her luxury."
66:18:4:Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, so you will not share in her sins or receive any of her plagues.
66:18:5:Her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
66:18:6:Pay her back just as she has paid others, and repay her double according to her deeds. In the cup she has mixed, mix a double portion for her.
66:18:7:To the degree that she glorified herself and lived in luxury, give her the same measure of torment and grief. For she says in her heart, 'I sit as a queen; I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.'
66:18:8:Therefore, her plagues will come in a single day—death, mourning, and famine—and she will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."
66:18:9:The kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning.
66:18:10:Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry, "Woe, woe to the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come."
66:18:11:And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—
66:18:12:cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, every article of ivory, every article made from costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble,
66:18:13:cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and the bodies and souls of humans.
66:18:14:"The fruit you longed for has left you, and all your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be found again."
66:18:15:The merchants who sold these things and grew rich from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn,
66:18:16:saying, "Woe, woe to the great city, clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls!
66:18:17:For in a single hour such fabulous wealth has been laid waste!" And every shipmaster, seafarer, sailor, and all who make their living from the sea will stand far off
66:18:18:and cry out as they see the smoke of her burning, "What city was ever like this great city?"
66:18:19:They will throw dust on their heads and weep and mourn, crying out, "Woe, woe to the great city, where all who had ships on the sea grew rich through her wealth! For in a single hour she has been destroyed."
66:18:20:Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has pronounced judgment against her on your behalf."
66:18:21:Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "With such violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, never to be found again.
66:18:22:The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again. No craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again, and the sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.
66:18:23:The light of a lamp will never shine in you again, and the voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's important people, and by your sorcery all nations were deceived.
66:18:24:In her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who have been slaughtered on the earth."
66:19:1:After this, I heard the roar of a vast crowd in heaven shouting, "Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God!
66:19:2:For his judgments are true and just; he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged the blood of his servants."
66:19:3:Again they shouted, "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever!"
66:19:4:Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. They cried, "Amen, Hallelujah!"
66:19:5:A voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!"
66:19:6:And I heard what sounded like a multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
66:19:7:Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb, and his bride has made herself ready.
66:19:8:She was given fine linen, bright and pure to wear." (The fine linen represents the righteous acts of God's holy people.)
66:19:9:Then the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!" And he added, "These are the true words of God."
66:19:10:I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus."
66:19:11:I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.
66:19:12:His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
66:19:13:He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
66:19:14:The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and pure.
66:19:15:Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter." He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
66:19:16:On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
66:19:17:And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
66:19:18:so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small."
66:19:19:Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
66:19:20:But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
66:19:21:The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
66:20:1:Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
66:20:2:He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
66:20:3:Afterward, he threw him into the abyss, locked it, and sealed it over him, preventing him from deceiving the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.
66:20:4:I also saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received the mark on their foreheads or hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
66:20:5:The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
66:20:6:Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them; they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
66:20:7:When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
66:20:8:and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand on the seashore.
66:20:9:They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
66:20:10:And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66:20:11:Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
66:20:12:I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
66:20:13:The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to their deeds.
66:20:14:Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
66:20:15:If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, they were thrown into the lake of fire.
66:21:1:Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared, and there was no more sea.
66:21:2:I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
66:21:3:I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
66:21:4:He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
66:21:5:The One who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
66:21:6:He also said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty, I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.
66:21:7:Those who overcome will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.
66:21:8:But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters, and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."
66:21:9:One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66:21:10:He carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
66:21:11:It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal.
66:21:12:It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
66:21:13:There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.
66:21:14:The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66:21:15:The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.
66:21:16:The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.
66:21:17:The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick.
66:21:18:The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
66:21:19:The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66:21:20:the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
66:21:21:The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
66:21:22:I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
66:21:23:The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
66:21:24:The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.
66:21:25:On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
66:21:26:The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
66:21:27:Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66:22:1:Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
66:22:2:In the middle of the city's street and on either side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
66:22:3:There will be no more curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.
66:22:4:They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66:22:5:There will be no night, and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. They will reign forever and ever.
66:22:6:The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place."
66:22:7:"Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll."
66:22:8:I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.
66:22:9:But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!"
66:22:10:Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near.
66:22:11:Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person remain vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy."
66:22:12:"Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done.
66:22:13:I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
66:22:14:Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
66:22:15:Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66:22:16:I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."
66:22:17:The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" Let the one who hears say, "Come!" Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.
66:22:18:I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll.
66:22:19:And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.
66:22:20:He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
66:22:21:The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen.
