61:1:1:From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received the same precious faith as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
61:1:2:May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
61:1:3:As His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence,
61:1:4:through these He has granted us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world because of evil desires.
61:1:5:For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge;
61:1:6:to knowledge, self-control; to self-control, perseverance; to perseverance, godliness;
61:1:7:to godliness, brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection, love.
61:1:8:For if these qualities are yours and continually increasing, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
61:1:9:But whoever lacks these qualities is shortsighted, even blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins.
61:1:10:Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these things, you will never stumble.
61:1:11:In this way, you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
61:1:12:So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you now have.
61:1:13:I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in this earthly tent,
61:1:14:knowing that the time for me to put aside my tent is near, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
61:1:15:And I will make every effort to ensure that after my departure, you will always be able to remember these things.
61:1:16:For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
61:1:17:He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
61:1:18:We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
61:1:19:We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
61:1:20:Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation.
61:1:21:For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
61:2:1:In the past, there were false prophets among God's people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.
61:2:2:Many will follow their shameful ways and bring the truth into disrepute because of them.
61:2:3:In their greed, these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their judgment has been hanging over them for a long time, and their destruction will not be delayed.
61:2:4:For if God didn't spare the angels who sinned but cast them down to hell, delivering them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;
61:2:5:And if He didn't spare the ancient world but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, along with seven others when He brought the flood upon the ungodly;
61:2:6:And if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes as an example for the ungodly in the future;
61:2:7:Yet rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless men;
61:2:8:For as he lived among them, that righteous man was tormented day after day by their lawless deeds;
61:2:9:The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.
61:2:10:This is especially true for those who indulge in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to slander celestial beings.
61:2:11:Even angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings before the Lord.
61:2:12:But these people, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct born to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of things they don't understand and will be utterly ruined in their destruction.
61:2:13:They will suffer harm as the wages of their wickedness. They consider it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight; they are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.
61:2:14:With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed—an accursed brood!
61:2:15:They have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.
61:2:16:But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
61:2:17:These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
61:2:18:For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.
61:2:19:They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.
61:2:20:If they have escaped the corruption of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.
61:2:21:It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then turn away from the sacred command that was passed on to them.
61:2:22:What has happened to them is like the true proverb says: "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to wallowing in the mud."
61:3:1:Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I've written both of them as reminders to stimulate your sincere minds by recalling the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
61:3:2:You must remember that in the last days, scoffers will come, mocking and following their own evil desires.
61:3:3:They'll say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."
61:3:4:But they deliberately forget that long ago, by God's word, the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
61:3:5:By these waters also, the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
61:3:6:Now, by the same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
61:3:7:Don't forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
61:3:8:The Lord isn't slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, he's patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
61:3:9:However, the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
61:3:10:Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You should live holy and godly lives,
61:3:11:as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.
61:3:12:But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
61:3:13:So then, dear friends, since you're looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
61:3:14:Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.
61:3:15:He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
61:3:16:Therefore, dear friends, since you've been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position.
61:3:17:Instead, grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.
