18:1:1:In the land of Uz, there was a man named Job. This man was honest, God-fearing, and avoided evil.
18:1:2:Job had seven sons and three daughters.
18:1:3:He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and employed a large number of servants. Job was the most prominent man in the East.
18:1:4:His sons would take turns hosting feasts in their homes, inviting their sisters to join them in eating and drinking.
18:1:5:When these celebrations concluded, Job would send for his children to purify them. He would wake up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job did this regularly.
18:1:6:One day, the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also joined them.
18:1:7:The Lord asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered, "From roaming throughout the earth and going back and forth on it."
18:1:8:Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, an honest and God-fearing man who avoids evil."
18:1:9:Satan replied to the Lord, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18:1:10:Haven't you protected him, his family, and everything he owns? You've blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18:1:11:But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18:1:12:The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, everything he has is in your power, but do not lay a finger on Job himself." Then Satan left the Lord's presence.
18:1:13:One day, when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
18:1:14:a messenger arrived at Job's home with the news, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
18:1:15:when Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18:1:16:While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18:1:17:Before he had finished speaking, yet another messenger arrived, reporting, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties, swooped down on your camels, and carried them away. They killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18:1:18:While he was still speaking, another messenger entered and announced, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at their oldest brother's house,
18:1:19:when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them, and they are all dead. I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18:1:20:Upon hearing this, Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground in worship,
18:1:21:saying, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will return. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."
18:1:22:In all this, Job did not sin or blame God for any wrongdoing.
18:2:1:One day, when the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also arrived among them.
18:2:2:The Lord asked Satan, "Where have you been?" Satan replied, "I've been roaming around the earth, going back and forth on it."
18:2:3:Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil. He still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
18:2:4:Satan answered the Lord, "Skin for skin! A man will give all he has for his own life.
18:2:5:But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18:2:6:The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, he is in your hands; but spare his life."
18:2:7:So Satan left the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
18:2:8:Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while sitting among the ashes.
18:2:9:His wife said to him, "Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!"
18:2:10:Job replied, "You're talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
18:2:11:When Job's three friends heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They agreed to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
18:2:12:When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him. They began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
18:2:13:Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw how great his suffering was.
18:3:1:After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18:3:2:Job spoke up and said:
18:3:3:"May the day I was born be erased, and also the night when it was said, 'A boy is conceived.'
18:3:4:Let that day turn to darkness; may God above not care about it, nor light shine upon it.
18:3:5:Let darkness and deep shadows claim it; let a cloud settle on it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
18:3:6:As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year or be counted in the months.
18:3:7:Yes, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come into it.
18:3:8:Let those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
18:3:9:Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning.
18:3:10:Because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
18:3:11:"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
18:3:12:Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts for me to nurse?
18:3:13:For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
18:3:14:With kings and counselors of the earth, who built ruins for themselves,
18:3:15:Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18:3:16:Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like infants who never see the light?
18:3:17:There, the wicked cease from turmoil, and there, the weary are at rest.
18:3:18:Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
18:3:19:The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
18:3:20:"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
18:3:21:To those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
18:3:22:Who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave?
18:3:23:Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18:3:24:For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.
18:3:25:What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
18:3:26:I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
18:4:1:Eliphaz from Teman began to speak, saying:
18:4:2:If someone dares to talk with you, would you be upset? But who can hold back from speaking?
18:4:3:Look, you've instructed many people and strengthened weak hands.
18:4:4:Your words have supported those who stumbled, and you've made feeble knees firm.
18:4:5:But now that trouble has come upon you, you're discouraged; when it touches you, you're dismayed.
18:4:6:Isn't your reverence for God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?
18:4:7:Think about it: has any innocent person ever perished, or have the upright been destroyed?
18:4:8:As I've observed, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
18:4:9:By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they're consumed.
18:4:10:The roar of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion are silenced; the teeth of young lions are broken.
18:4:11:The strong lion dies without prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18:4:12:A word was secretly brought to me, and my ear caught a whisper of it.
18:4:13:In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on people,
18:4:14:Fear and trembling seized me, making all my bones shake.
18:4:15:A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood up.
18:4:16:It stopped, but I couldn't discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, and then I heard a voice:
18:4:17:"Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a human being more pure than their Creator?"
18:4:18:If God doesn't trust his own servants and charges his angels with error,
18:4:19:How much less will he trust those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, and who can be crushed like a moth?
18:4:20:Between morning and evening they're broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
18:4:21:The cords of their tent are pulled up, and they die without wisdom.
18:5:1:Listen carefully to my words, Job; pay attention to what I have to say.
18:5:2:Look, the children of God will testify, and their wisdom will teach you.
18:5:3:I have seen it myself; I've observed it and can confirm it's true.
18:5:4:There's a saying that goes, "Man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward."
18:5:5:But don't worry, for I would seek God's help and present my case before Him,
18:5:6:He who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.
18:5:7:He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields,
18:5:8:He sets the lowly on high, lifting them from their affliction.
18:5:9:He confounds the plans of the crafty, so their hands achieve no success.
18:5:10:He catches the wise in their own cunning, and the schemes of the wily are thwarted.
18:5:11:By day they meet with darkness, and at noon they grope as if it were night.
18:5:12:God saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
18:5:13:So the poor have hope, while injustice is silenced.
18:5:14:Blessed is the one whom God corrects; do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18:5:15:For He wounds, but He also binds up; He injures, but His hands also heal.
18:5:16:From six calamities He will rescue you; in seven, no harm will touch you.
18:5:17:In famine, He will redeem you from death, and in battle, from the stroke of the sword.
18:5:18:You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
18:5:19:You will laugh at destruction and famine, and not fear the wild animals.
18:5:20:For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18:5:21:You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
18:5:22:You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
18:5:23:You will come to your grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
18:5:24:We have examined this, and it's true. So listen to it and apply it to yourself.
18:6:1:Then Job responded and said,
18:6:2:Oh, if only my grief could be accurately weighed, and my misery laid alongside it on the scales!
18:6:3:For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; this is why my words are so rash.
18:6:4:The arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; their poison seeps into my spirit. The terrors of God surround me.
18:6:5:Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass? Or does an ox bellow when it has fodder?
18:6:6:Can tasteless food be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
18:6:7:My soul refuses to touch such things; they are like loathsome food to me.
18:6:8:If only my request would come true, and that God would grant what I long for,
18:6:9:That He would decide to crush me, releasing His hand to cut me off!
18:6:10:This would still bring me comfort, and I would rejoice in unrelenting pain, knowing that I haven't denied the words of the Holy One.
18:6:11:What strength do I have left, that I should continue to hope? What future awaits me, that I should prolong my life?
18:6:12:Is my strength like that of stone? Is my body made of bronze?
18:6:13:No, I am utterly helpless, and there's no relief in sight.
18:6:14:A friend should show kindness to one who's afflicted, even if they've forsaken the fear of the Almighty.
18:6:15:But my brothers have been as undependable as a seasonal stream, like torrents that vanish when needed,
18:6:16:Which are darkened by ice and where snow hides.
18:6:17:When the heat comes, they disappear; when it's hot, they vanish from their place.
18:6:18:The paths of their course wind along, they evaporate into the wasteland and perish.
18:6:19:Caravans from Tema search for water; travelers from Sheba hope to find it.
18:6:20:They're disappointed because they were confident; they arrive there only to be confounded.
18:6:21:Now you've become like them; you see my affliction and are afraid.
18:6:22:Did I ever ask you for help? Did I plead for you to rescue me?
18:6:23:Did I request your aid or the strength of your hand? No, not at all!
18:6:24:Teach me, and I will be silent. Show me where I have gone astray.
18:6:25:Honest words are powerful, but what do your criticisms prove?
18:6:26:Do you think your words are mere wind? Why must you attack a desperate man?
18:6:27:You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend.
18:6:28:Look at me closely! Would I lie to your face?
18:6:29:Reconsider, don't be unjust; reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.
18:6:30:Is there any falsehood on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern evil?
18:7:1: "Do not human beings have a hard service on earth? Are not their days like those of a hired laborer?
18:7:2: Like a slave who longs for the evening shadow, or a worker who eagerly awaits his wages,
18:7:3: so I am given months of futility, and nights of misery are assigned to me.
18:7:4: When I lie down, I think, 'When will I get up?' But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
18:7:5: My body is covered with maggots and scabs; my skin is broken and festering.
18:7:6: My days pass swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
18:7:7: Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never again see happiness.
18:7:8: The eye that now sees me will no longer behold me; when you look for me, I will be gone.
18:7:9: As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so one who goes down to the grave does not return.
18:7:10: He will never come back to his house; his place will know him no more.
18:7:11: Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, and complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18:7:12: Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me?
18:7:13: When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
18:7:14: then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18:7:15: so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
18:7:16: I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
18:7:17: What is mankind that you make so much of them, and that you pay attention to them?
18:7:18: You examine them every morning and test them every moment.
18:7:19: Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
18:7:20: If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of humanity? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
18:7:21: Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For soon I will lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."
18:8:1:Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:
18:8:2:How long will you keep talking like this? Your words are like a strong wind.
18:8:3:Does God twist justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18:8:4:If your children have sinned against Him, He has allowed them to suffer the consequences of their wrongdoing.
18:8:5:But if you earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,
18:8:6:If you are pure and upright, surely He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous home.
18:8:7:Your beginnings might be modest, but your future will be prosperous.
18:8:8:Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their ancestors.
18:8:9:For we were born only yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.
18:8:10:Won't they teach you and tell you, speaking from their understanding?
18:8:11:Can papyrus grow tall where there's no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
18:8:12:While still green and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
18:8:13:Such is the destiny of all who forget God; the hope of the godless will perish.
18:8:14:Their confidence is fragile; their trust is a spider's web.
18:8:15:They lean on their web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold.
18:8:16:They are like well-watered plants in the sunshine, spreading their shoots over the garden.
18:8:17:Their roots wrap around the rock heap; they look for a foothold among the stones.
18:8:18:But when they are pulled up from their spot, that place disowns them, saying, 'I never saw you.'
18:8:19:Surely this is the joy of their way; yet others will spring up from the dust.
18:8:20:Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor does He support evildoers.
18:8:21:He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
18:8:22:Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more.
18:9:1:Job replied:
18:9:2:I truly know this is the case, but how can a person be righteous before God?
18:9:3:If one wanted to argue with Him, they couldn't win against Him even once in a thousand times.
18:9:4:He is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has ever defied Him and come out unharmed?
18:9:5:He moves mountains without them knowing it and overturns them in His anger.
18:9:6:He shakes the earth from its place, making its pillars tremble.
18:9:7:He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars.
18:9:8:He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
18:9:9:He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky.
18:9:10:He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that are beyond count.
18:9:11:When He passes by me, I don't see Him; when He moves, I don't perceive Him.
18:9:12:He snatches up what He wants, and no one can stop Him; no one can ask Him, "What are You doing?"
18:9:13:God doesn't restrain His anger; even the helpers of the sea monster bow beneath Him.
18:9:14:So how could I possibly argue with Him? I can only plead for mercy.
18:9:15:Even if I were right, I couldn't answer Him; I would have to beg my Judge for mercy.
18:9:16:If I called and He answered, I wouldn't believe He was listening to me.
18:9:17:He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds without cause.
18:9:18:He wouldn't let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
18:9:19:If it's a matter of strength, He is mighty; if it's about justice, who can challenge Him?
18:9:20:Even if I were innocent, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.
18:9:21:I am blameless, but I don't care about myself; I despise my life.
18:9:22:It's all the same, so I say, "He destroys both the blameless and the wicked."
18:9:23:When disaster brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
18:9:24:The earth is handed over to the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it's not Him, then who is it?
18:9:25:My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without seeing any good.
18:9:26:They glide past like reed boats, like an eagle swooping on its prey.
18:9:27:If I say, "I'll forget my complaint and change my expression and be cheerful,"
18:9:28:I still dread all my sufferings, for I know You won't hold me innocent.
18:9:29:I will be found guilty, so why should I struggle in vain?
18:9:30:Even if I washed myself with soap and cleansed my hands with lye,
18:9:31:You would plunge me into a muddy pit, and my clothes would detest me.
18:9:32:God is not a mortal like me that I might answer Him, that we might confront each other in court.
18:9:33:If only there were a mediator between us, someone who could bring us together,
18:9:34:who could remove God's rod from me, so that His terror wouldn't frighten me anymore.
18:9:35:Then I would speak up without fear of Him, but as it stands now, I cannot.
18:10:1:I cry out to you, God, 'Why do you persecute me? Why do you treat me harshly?'
18:10:2:'Have I not done enough good to satisfy you? Or is it that you are searching for my faults?'
18:10:3:'It feels like your hand is heavy upon me, and you scrutinize my every move.'
18:10:4:'You know that I am not wicked, but there is no one to rescue me from your grasp.'
18:10:5:'Your hands have shaped and crafted me, yet now you seek to destroy me.'
18:10:6:'Remember that you made me from clay, and will return me to dust.'
18:10:7:'You gave me life and showed me kindness, but now you watch over my sins.'
18:10:8:'Though you formed me in secret, you still have a plan to bring me down.'
18:10:9:'Please remember that you made me like yourself, so why would you want to destroy me?'
18:10:10:'Do you not see how my skin and flesh cling to my bones, a testament to your work?'
18:10:11:'You granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit.'
18:10:12:'Yet you hid these troubles in your heart, knowing that they would come upon me.'
18:10:13:'If I sin, you take note, and don't let my wrongdoings go unpunished.'
18:10:14:'If I'm guilty, woe to me! But if I'm innocent, I can't lift my head, for I am filled with shame and misery.'
18:10:15:'Should I hold my head high, you hunt me like a lion, displaying your power against me.'
18:10:16:'You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.'
18:10:17:'Why did you let me be born? I wish I had died before anyone saw me.'
18:10:18:'I long for the time when I was not, as if I had never been born, carried from the womb to the grave.'
18:10:19:'My life is so short; leave me alone, let me find a moment of peace.'
18:10:20:'Before I go to the place of no return, the land of darkness and deep shadow,'
18:10:21:'The land where all is gloom and chaos, where even the light is like darkness.'
18:11:1:Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:
18:11:2:Shouldn't someone answer this abundance of words? Should a talkative person be considered right?
18:11:3:Should your empty chatter silence others? Will you scoff without anyone putting you in your place?
18:11:4:You've claimed, "My beliefs are pure, and I'm innocent in your eyes."
18:11:5:But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,
18:11:6:He would reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, for true understanding has two sides. Know that God forgets some of your sin.
18:11:7:Can you fathom the depths of God? Can you grasp the limits of the Almighty?
18:11:8:They're higher than the heavens—what can you do? They're deeper than the underworld—what can you know?
18:11:9:Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18:11:10:If He comes along and imprisons or convenes a court, who can oppose Him?
18:11:11:For He knows deceitful people; He sees wickedness and doesn't ignore it.
18:11:12:An empty-headed person won't suddenly become wise any more than a wild donkey's colt can be born a human.
18:11:13:If you direct your heart rightly and spread out your hands toward Him,
18:11:14:If there's iniquity in your hand, remove it, and don't allow injustice to dwell in your tents—
18:11:15:Then you'll be able to lift your face without shame, and you'll stand firm without fear.
18:11:16:You'll forget your misery, recalling it only as water that has flowed by.
18:11:17:Your life will be brighter than noon; even darkness will be like the morning.
18:11:18:You'll have confidence because there's hope, and you'll look around and rest securely.
18:11:19:You'll lie down without anyone to make you afraid, and many will seek your favor.
18:11:20:But the eyes of the wicked will fail, their escape route will be cut off, and their only hope will be the last breath they take.
18:12:1:Job then responded, "No doubt you all think you're the wisest of people.
18:12:2:But I'm not inferior to you; who doesn't know these things?
18:12:3:I've become a laughingstock to my friends, even though I called on God and He answered me. A man of integrity, now ridiculed!
18:12:4:In times of ease, the untroubled mock those whose steps falter.
18:12:5:Contempt is reserved for those facing misfortune, for those whose feet slip.
18:12:6:The tents of robbers prosper, and those who provoke God live securely, as if they have God in their hands.
18:12:7:But ask the animals, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
18:12:8:Speak to the earth, and it will instruct you; let the fish of the sea inform you.
18:12:9:Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?
18:12:10:In His hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
18:12:11:Doesn't the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
18:12:12:Wisdom belongs to the aged, and understanding comes with years.
18:12:13:True wisdom and power are found in God; counsel and understanding are His.
18:12:14:If He tears down, no one can rebuild; if He imprisons, no one can release.
18:12:15:If He withholds water, everything dries up; if He releases it, it overwhelms the land.
18:12:16:Strength and success belong to Him; both the deceived and the deceiver are in His control.
18:12:17:He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.
18:12:18:He removes the authority of kings and ties a belt around their waists.
18:12:19:He leads priests away in disgrace and overthrows the established.
18:12:20:He silences the trusted voices and takes away the discernment of elders.
18:12:21:He pours out contempt on nobles and loosens the belts of the strong.
18:12:22:He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings utter darkness into light.
18:12:23:He makes nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges nations, then leads them away.
18:12:24:He deprives the leaders of their understanding and sends them wandering through a trackless wasteland.
18:12:25:They grope in darkness with no light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.
18:13:1:In this chapter, Job continues speaking, saying that he has seen all of this before and understands it well.
18:13:2:He insists that he is not inferior to his friends and that they are not superior in wisdom to him.
18:13:3:Job asks them to listen carefully to his arguments and consider what he has to say.
18:13:4:He asserts that he will present his case before God with confidence, knowing that he has spoken the truth.
18:13:5:Job challenges his friends to prove him wrong, but warns them that God will ultimately judge their arguments.
18:13:6:He pleads with them to listen to his reasoning, so they can understand why he believes he is innocent.
18:13:7:Job questions whether they will speak falsely on God's behalf and be deceitful in their arguments.
18:13:8:He wonders if they will show partiality toward God and try to defend Him without considering the evidence.
18:13:9:Job warns them that it would be better for them to be silent than to speak dishonestly in defense of God.
18:13:10:He advises them to keep quiet so that wisdom can emerge from their silence.
18:13:11:Job acknowledges that he will continue to hold onto his integrity despite the suffering he is experiencing.
18:13:12:He declares that his life is in God's hands, and he is ready to face whatever judgment God has in store for him.
18:13:13:Job encourages his friends to reconsider their position, as he is confident in his own innocence.
18:13:14:He is willing to take any risk necessary to defend his innocence, even if it means putting his life on the line.
18:13:15:Job expresses his faith that God will eventually vindicate him, even if he has to die in the process.
18:13:16:He calls on his friends to witness his declaration of innocence and to see that he is not afraid to stand before God.
18:13:17:Job asks them to consider his words carefully, as they may hold the key to understanding his situation.
18:13:18:He concludes by stating that he has presented his case and now awaits their response.
18:14:1:Man, born of woman, has a short life and is full of trouble.
18:14:2:He grows like a flower and withers away; he flees like a shadow and does not remain.
18:14:3:Do you open your eyes on such a one and bring him into judgment with you?
18:14:4:Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!
18:14:5:Since his days are determined, the number of his months is with you; you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass.
18:14:6:Look away from him, so he may rest, until he enjoys his day like a hired hand.
18:14:7:For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and its shoots will not cease.
18:14:8:Though its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil,
18:14:9:Yet at the scent of water, it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.
18:14:10:But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and where is he?
18:14:11:As waters evaporate from the sea, and a river wastes away and dries up,
18:14:12:So a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep.
18:14:13:Oh, that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time and then remember me!
18:14:14:If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my release should come.
18:14:15:You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands.
18:14:16:For then you would count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
18:14:17:My transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity.
18:14:18:But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, and a rock is removed from its place,
18:14:19:As waters wear away stones, and torrents wash away the soil of the earth, so you destroy the hope of man.
18:14:20:You overpower him forever, and he departs; you change his appearance and send him away.
18:14:21:His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he is unaware of it.
18:14:22:He feels only the pain of his own body, and his soul mourns over himself.
18:15:1:Eliphaz the Temanite responded:
18:15:2:"Should a wise person speak with empty knowledge, and fill their belly with the east wind?
18:15:3:Should they argue with useless words, or give speeches that have no value?
18:15:4:Indeed, you are undermining reverence for God, and hindering meditation before Him.
18:15:5:Your sin dictates your speech; you've chosen the language of the cunning.
18:15:6:Your own mouth condemns you, not me; your lips testify against you.
18:15:7:Were you the first person born? Or were you created before the hills?
18:15:8:Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
18:15:9:What do you know that we don't? What understanding do you possess that isn't among us?
18:15:10:Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men far older than your father.
18:15:11:Are God's consolations not enough for you, even the gentle words spoken to you?
18:15:12:Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18:15:13:so that you turn your spirit against God and let such words escape your mouth?
18:15:14:What is man, that he can be pure? Or how can one born of a woman be righteous?
18:15:15:If God places no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,
18:15:16:how much less is man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is only a worm?"
18:16:1:Then Job spoke up and said,
18:16:2:I've heard many such things; you all are miserable comforters!
18:16:3:Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to keep on arguing?
18:16:4:I too could speak like you if I were in your place. I could come up with clever arguments against you and shake my head at you.
18:16:5:But instead, I would strengthen you with my words and offer comfort with my speech.
18:16:6:Even though I speak, my pain remains; if I stay silent, does it go away?
18:16:7:Now God has worn me out; He has destroyed my entire family.
18:16:8:You have shriveled me up, and it serves as a witness against me; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.
18:16:9:God's anger tears at me and hates me; He grinds His teeth at me. My enemy stares at me with piercing eyes.
18:16:10:People open their mouths wide against me; they strike my cheek in contempt and unite against me.
18:16:11:God hands me over to the ungodly and throws me into the clutches of the wicked.
18:16:12:I was once at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me His target;
18:16:13:His archers surround me. He pierces my heart without mercy and pours out my gall on the ground.
18:16:14:He breaks through my defenses again and again; He charges at me like a warrior.
18:16:15:I have sewn sackcloth over my skin and buried my dignity in the dust.
18:16:16:My face is red with weeping, and dark shadows encircle my eyes;
18:16:17:Yet there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
18:16:18:Earth, don't cover my blood; let my cry for help find no resting place!
18:16:19:Even now, my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
18:16:20:My friends mock me as I weep before God; I plead with Him for a human to plead with Him as one pleads for a friend.
18:16:21:Only a few years remain before I take the path of no return.
18:17:1:My spirit is broken, my days are cut short; the grave awaits me.
18:17:2:Surely, mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze upon their hostility.
18:17:3:Put up a pledge for me with Yourself, O God; who else will be my guarantor?
18:17:4:You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore, do not let them triumph.
18:17:5:Those who betray friends for personal gain—their children's eyes will fail.
18:17:6:You have made me an object of scorn to others; I have become a laughingstock.
18:17:7:My eyes have grown dim from grief, and my whole body is like a shadow.
18:17:8:The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the ungodly.
18:17:9:Yet the righteous hold on to their ways, and those with clean hands grow stronger.
18:17:10:But as for all of you, come back and try again! I won't find a wise person among you.
18:17:11:My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and my heart's desires.
18:17:12:They turn night into day, claiming that light is near in the face of darkness.
18:17:13:If I hope only for the grave as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,
18:17:14:And say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother and sister,'
18:17:15:Where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
18:17:16:Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?
18:18:1:Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18:18:2:How long will you keep speaking like this? Consider your words carefully.
18:18:3:Why do you view us as if we were cattle, as if we're unwise in your eyes?
18:18:4:You tear yourself apart in anger. Will the earth be abandoned for your sake, or the rocks be moved from their place?
18:18:5:Indeed, the light of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not shine.
18:18:6:The light in his tent grows dim, and the lamp above him is put out.
18:18:7:His confident stride is shortened, and his own schemes bring him down.
18:18:8:He's caught in a net by his own feet and walks into a trap.
18:18:9:A snare seizes him by the heel, and a trap holds him fast.
18:18:10:Hidden cords lie on the ground for him, and ropes are spread across his path.
18:18:11:Terrors frighten him on every side and chase him at every step.
18:18:12:Calamity hungers for him, and disaster stands ready at his side.
18:18:13:It devours parts of his skin; death's firstborn consumes his limbs.
18:18:14:He's torn from the safety of his tent and marched before the king of terrors.
18:18:15:Nothing he owned remains in his tent; sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
18:18:16:His roots below dry up, and his branches above wither away.
18:18:17:His memory fades from the earth, and he has no name in the land.
18:18:18:He's driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world.
18:18:19:He leaves no offspring or descendants among his people, and no survivor where he once lived.
18:18:20:People in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east are seized with horror.
18:18:21:Indeed, such is the dwelling of the wicked, and this is the place of those who don't know God.
18:19:1: Job responded:
18:19:2: "How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?
18:19:3: You have insulted me ten times already; aren't you ashamed to mistreat me?
18:19:4: Even if I am truly at fault, my mistake remains with me.
18:19:5: If you really want to exalt yourselves over me and use my humiliation as evidence against me,
18:19:6: know this: God has wronged me and surrounded me with his net.
18:19:7: "If I cry out for help, there's no response; I call for justice, but it doesn't come.
18:19:8: He has blocked my path, so I can't move forward; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
18:19:9: He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18:19:10: He tears me down on every side, and I am ruined; he uproots my hope like a tree.
18:19:11: His anger burns against me, and he treats me like an enemy.
18:19:12: "His troops advance together; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
18:19:13: He has alienated my family from me; my acquaintances are now estranged.
18:19:14: My relatives have abandoned me, and my close friends have forgotten me.
18:19:15: Guests in my house and my maidservants consider me a stranger; I am a foreigner in their eyes.
18:19:16: I call to my servant, but he does not answer, even when I plead with him personally.
18:19:17: "My breath is offensive to my wife, and I am repulsive to my own family.
18:19:18: Even young children despise me; when I stand up, they ridicule me.
18:19:19: All my close friends detest me; those I loved have turned against me.
18:19:20: I am skin and bones, barely escaping death by the skin of my teeth.
18:19:21: "Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
18:19:22: Why do you pursue me like God does? Aren't you satisfied with my flesh?
18:19:23: "If only my words were written down! If only they were inscribed in a book!
18:19:24: If they were engraved with an iron pen on lead or etched permanently into rock!
18:19:25: But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end, he will stand upon the earth.
18:19:26: After my skin has been destroyed, in my flesh, I will see God.
18:19:27: I will see him for myself; my eyes will behold him, and not as a stranger. My heart longs within me.
18:19:28: "If you say, 'Let's persecute him since we've found the root of the matter in him,'
18:19:29: be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings punishment by the sword, so you may know there is a judgment."
18:20:1:Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said:
18:20:2:Truly, my thoughts urge me to respond, because I am greatly disturbed.
18:20:3:I've heard a rebuke that insults me, so now I'll answer with my understanding.
18:20:4:Do you not know this from ancient times, since humanity was placed on earth,
18:20:5:That the triumph of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless lasts only a moment?
18:20:6:Though their pride reaches the heavens and their heads touch the clouds,
18:20:7:They will vanish forever like their own dung; those who saw them will ask, "Where have they gone?"
18:20:8:Like a dream, they will fly away, never to be found; they will be chased away like a vision in the night.
18:20:9:The eye that saw them will see them no more, and their place will know them no longer.
18:20:10:Their children must pay back the poor, and their hands return their wealth.
18:20:11:Their bones were full of youthful vigor, but it will lie down with them in the dust.
18:20:12:Evil tastes sweet in their mouths; they hide it under their tongues.
18:20:13:They savor it, unwilling to let it go, holding it in their mouths.
18:20:14:But in their stomachs, it turns sour, becoming the venom of serpents within them.
18:20:15:They swallow wealth, but vomit it out; God will force it from their stomachs.
18:20:16:They suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an asp kill them.
18:20:17:They will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18:20:18:They must return what they worked for without consuming it; they won't enjoy the profits of their trade.
18:20:19:For they oppressed the poor and left them destitute; they seized houses they did not build.
18:20:20:Surely, they will not feel secure in their wealth, nor find lasting success.
18:20:21:Nothing will be left for them to devour; their prosperity will not endure.
18:20:22:In the midst of their plenty, they will face distress; the full force of misery will come upon them.
18:20:23:When they have filled their bellies, God will send His burning anger against them, raining it down on them as they eat.
18:20:24:If they escape an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce them.
18:20:25:It is drawn out of their bodies, the gleaming point from their liver; terrors come over them.
18:20:26:Total darkness awaits their treasures; a fire unfanned by human hands will consume them, destroying all who remain in their tents.
18:20:27:The heavens will reveal their guilt, and the earth will rise up against them.
18:20:28:The possessions of their house will be carried away, washed off in the day of God's wrath.
18:20:29:This is the wicked person's fate from God, the inheritance decreed for them by the Almighty.
18:21:1:Job replied, "Pay attention to my words, all of you, and let this be your comfort.
18:21:2:Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there's more to say on God's behalf.
18:21:3:I'll gather my knowledge from afar, and I'll attribute righteousness to my Maker.
18:21:4:For truly, my words are not false; one who has perfect understanding is with you.
18:21:5:Look at the heavens and see; observe the clouds high above you.
18:21:6:If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If your transgressions multiply, what do you do to Him?
18:21:7:If you're righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
18:21:8:Your wickedness affects only someone like yourself, and your righteousness benefits only a fellow human.
18:21:9:Because of the multitude of oppressions, people cry out; they call for help due to the arm of the mighty.
18:21:10:But no one says, 'Where is God, my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
18:21:11:who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?'
18:21:12:Then they cry out, but He doesn't answer, because of the pride of evil people.
18:21:13:Surely, God will not listen to empty pleas; the Almighty won't regard them.
18:21:14:How much less when you say you don't see Him, that your case is before Him, and you're waiting for Him!
18:21:15:And now, since His anger doesn't punish, and He doesn't take much notice of wickedness,
18:21:16:Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."
18:22:1:Eliphaz the Temanite began speaking again, saying:
18:22:2:Can a person really be of any help to God? Even the wise are only useful to themselves.
18:22:3:Does it matter to the Almighty if you're righteous? Does He gain anything if your ways are perfect?
18:22:4:Do you think He's correcting you and bringing charges against you because of your reverence for Him?
18:22:5:Isn't it actually because your wickedness is great and your iniquities have no end?
18:22:6:You've taken pledges from your relatives without cause, leaving them stripped of their clothing.
18:22:7:You haven't given water to the weary or fed the hungry.
18:22:8:You've used your power to claim land, but only the influential live there.
18:22:9:You've sent widows away empty-handed and crushed the arms of the fatherless.
18:22:10:That's why snares surround you, and sudden fear terrifies you.
18:22:11:You can't see the darkness that covers you, and you're swept away by a flood of troubles.
18:22:12:God is so high up in the heavens; just look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!
18:22:13:And you say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?'
18:22:14:Clouds hide Him so He can't see, and He walks on the vault of heaven.
18:22:15:Will you follow the ancient path trodden by wicked people?
18:22:16:They were snatched away before their time, their foundations washed away by a river.
18:22:17:They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'
18:22:18:Yet He filled their houses with good things. The plans of the wicked are far from me!
18:22:19:The righteous see and rejoice; the innocent laugh at them, saying,
18:22:20:'Surely our enemies have been destroyed, and fire has consumed their wealth.'
18:22:21:So, be reconciled with God and find peace. In this way, prosperity will come to you.
18:22:22:Accept instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.
18:22:23:If you return to the Almighty, you'll be restored. Remove wrongdoing from your tent.
18:22:24:Throw your gold into the dust, and your precious metal among the stones of the brooks.
18:22:25:Then the Almighty will be your gold, your finest treasure.
18:22:26:You'll delight in the Almighty and lift your face to God.
18:22:27:You'll pray to Him, and He'll hear you, and you'll fulfill your vows.
18:22:28:When you decide on a course, it will succeed, and light will shine on your path.
18:22:29:When people are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then He will save the humble.
18:22:30:He will even rescue those who are not innocent, for they will be saved by the purity of your hands.
18:23:1:Then Job spoke up and said:
18:23:2:I wish I knew where to find God; I'd go to His place of judgment.
18:23:3:I would present my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18:23:4:I want to know the words He would use to answer me, and understand what He would tell me.
18:23:5:Would He argue forcefully against me? No, He would listen to me closely.
18:23:6:There, an honest person could reason with Him, and I would be acquitted forever by my Judge.
18:23:7:But if I go east, He is not there; if I head west, I cannot perceive Him.
18:23:8:When He works in the north, I cannot see Him; when He turns south, I catch no glimpse of Him.
18:23:9:Yet He knows the path I have taken; when He has tested me, I will emerge as pure gold.
18:23:10:My feet have followed His steps closely; I have kept to His way without turning aside.
18:23:11:I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.
18:23:12:But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does whatever He desires.
18:23:13:He carries out His decree against me, and many such plans He still has in store.
18:23:14:That is why I am terrified before Him; when I think of all this, I fear Him.
18:23:15:God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
18:23:16:Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, nor by the thick darkness that covers my face.
18:24:1:Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why can't those who know Him see His days?
18:24:2:Some people move boundary stones; they steal flocks and pasture them.
18:24:3:They take away the donkeys of the fatherless, and they seize the widow's ox as collateral.
18:24:4:The poor are pushed off the path; the needy must hide together for safety.
18:24:5:Like wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to work, searching for food. The wasteland provides food for their children.
18:24:6:They gather their fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
18:24:7:Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold.
18:24:8:They are drenched by mountain rains and huddle against the rocks for shelter.
18:24:9:The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is taken as collateral.
18:24:10:Without clothes, they wander about; hungry, they carry the sheaves.
18:24:11:Between the terraces, they press out the oil; they tread the winepresses but go thirsty.
18:24:12:From the city, the dying groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. Yet God pays no attention to their prayers.
18:24:13:There are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.
18:24:14:At dawn, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; at night, he becomes a thief.
18:24:15:The adulterer's eye watches for twilight, thinking, 'No one will see me,' and he disguises his face.
18:24:16:In the dark, they break into houses; by day, they lock themselves in, not wanting to experience the light.
18:24:17:For they dread the terrors of darkness and fear the blackest darkness.
18:24:18:They are like foam on the surface of the water; their portion is cursed in the land. They do not go toward the vineyards.
18:24:19:Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned.
18:24:20:The womb forgets them; worms feast on them. They are remembered no more; like a tree, wickedness is broken off.
18:24:21:They prey on the barren and childless woman, showing no kindness to the widow.
18:24:22:God, in His power, drags away the mighty; though they rise up, they have no assurance of life.
18:24:23:He provides them with security, but His eyes are on their ways.
18:24:24:They are exalted for a little while, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
18:24:25:If this is not true, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?
18:25:1:Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said:
18:25:2:God's dominion is vast, and his power is immense. Who can challenge him in his high place?
18:25:3:Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise?
18:25:4:How can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of a woman be pure?
18:25:5:If even the moon lacks brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight,
18:25:6:how much less is man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is only a worm?
18:26:1:Job responded:
18:26:2:"How have you helped the powerless and saved the weak?
18:26:3:What wisdom have you provided to the ignorant? What insights have you revealed?
18:26:4:Whose spirit spoke through you, and whose breath gave you these words?
18:26:5:Even the spirits of the dead tremble beneath the waters and their inhabitants.
18:26:6:Naked is the realm of the dead before God; the place of destruction lies uncovered.
18:26:7:He stretches out the northern skies over empty space; He suspends the earth upon nothing.
18:26:8:He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
18:26:9:He conceals the face of the full moon, spreading His cloud over it.
18:26:10:He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
18:26:11:The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at His rebuke.
18:26:12:By His power, He stirs up the sea; by His understanding, He shatters the monster Rahab.
18:26:13:With His breath, He clears the skies; His hand pierces the fleeing serpent.
18:26:14:These are but glimpses of His work; only a whisper of Him do we hear. Who can comprehend the thunder of His power?"
18:27:1:Job continued his discourse, saying:
18:27:2:As long as I live, and the breath of God is in me,
18:27:3:My lips will not speak falsehood, nor my tongue utter deceit.
18:27:4:Never will I declare you to be right; until my dying day, I'll maintain my integrity.
18:27:5:God forbid that I should justify your claims; till the end, I'll never abandon my innocence.
18:27:6:I hold fast to my righteousness and won't let it go; my conscience is clear for all my days.
18:27:7:Let my enemy be like the wicked, and the one who rises against me like the unrighteous.
18:27:8:For what hope does the godless have when they are cut off, when God takes away their life?
18:27:9:Will God listen to their cry when trouble comes upon them?
18:27:10:Can they find joy in the Almighty or call on God at any time?
18:27:11:I'll teach you about God's power; I won't conceal the ways of the Almighty.
18:27:12:You've all seen this for yourselves, so why do you keep up this empty talk?
18:27:13:This is the fate God reserves for the wicked, the inheritance the ruthless receive from the Almighty:
18:27:14:If their children multiply, it's for the sword; their offspring will never have enough to eat.
18:27:15:Those who survive will die by plague, and their widows will not weep for them.
18:27:16:Though they heap up silver like dust and pile up clothing like clay,
18:27:17:The righteous will wear what they piled up, and the innocent will divide their silver.
18:27:18:They build their houses like a spider's web, like a hut made by a watchman.
18:27:19:They lie down wealthy, but for the last time; when they open their eyes, it's all gone.
18:27:20:Terrors overtake them like a flood; in the night, a storm snatches them away.
18:27:21:The east wind carries them off, and they're gone; it sweeps them from their place.
18:27:22:God hurls his fury at them without pity, as they try to flee from his power.
18:27:23:He claps his hands at them and hisses them out of their place.
18:28:1:In search of silver, people dig deep into the earth, and they refine gold from ore.
18:28:2:Iron is taken from the ground, and copper is smelted from rock.
18:28:3:Humans explore the darkness, searching to the farthest depths for rocks hidden in gloom and shadow.
18:28:4:They open up shafts far from civilization, where others have never set foot, hanging and swinging on ropes.
18:28:5:From the earth comes food, but beneath it is turned up as if by fire.
18:28:6:Sapphires are found in its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
18:28:7:No bird of prey knows that hidden path; no falcon's eye has seen it.
18:28:8:Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.
18:28:9:People attack the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains.
18:28:10:They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures.
18:28:11:They search the sources of rivers and bring hidden things to light.
18:28:12:But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
18:28:13:No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
18:28:14:The deep says, "It is not in me"; the sea says, "It is not with me."
18:28:15:It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
18:28:16:It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
18:28:17:Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
18:28:18:Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
18:28:19:The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.
18:28:20:So where does wisdom come from? Where is the place of understanding?
18:28:21:It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky.
18:28:22:Destruction and Death say, "Only a rumor of it has reached our ears."
18:28:23:God understands the way to it, and he alone knows where it dwells,
18:28:24:For he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18:28:25:When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,
18:28:26:When he set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,
18:28:27:Then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.
18:28:28:And he said to the human race, "The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding."
18:29:1:Job began to speak again, saying:
18:29:2:In the past, during my prime, when God watched over me,
18:29:3:His light shone on my path, and I walked through darkness.
18:29:4:I long for the days of my youth, when the friendship of God filled my home.
18:29:5:The Almighty was with me then, and my children surrounded me.
18:29:6:My steps were bathed in cream, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me.
18:29:7:When I went to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,
18:29:8:The young men saw me and stepped aside, while the old men stood up in respect.
18:29:9:Princes stopped speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.
18:29:10:Nobles fell silent, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
18:29:11:People who heard me praised my words, and those who saw me spoke well of me.
18:29:12:I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had no one to assist them.
18:29:13:The dying blessed me, and I made widows' hearts sing for joy.
18:29:14:I put on righteousness like a coat, and justice was my robe and turban.
18:29:15:I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
18:29:16:I was a father to the needy, and I championed the cause of strangers.
18:29:17:I broke the jaws of wicked people and snatched their prey from their teeth.
18:29:18:Back then, I thought, "I will die in my own house, and my days will be as numerous as the grains of sand.
18:29:19:My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will rest on my branches all night.
18:29:20:My honor will remain fresh with me, and my bow will stay strong in my hand."
18:29:21:People listened to me expectantly, waiting for my counsel.
18:29:22:After I spoke, they had nothing more to say; my words fell gently on their ears.
18:29:23:They waited for my advice like rain and opened their mouths wide for it.
18:29:24:When I smiled at them, they couldn't believe it; they never saw a cloud darken my face.
18:29:25:I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelled as a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.
18:30:1:In my prime, people respected me; now they ridicule me.
18:30:2:Indeed, I am mocked by those younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to place with my sheep dogs.
18:30:3:What good was their strength to me? Their vigor had long since vanished.
18:30:4:They scavenged the arid wasteland for food, gnawing on roots of broom bushes.
18:30:5:They were driven out from society, people shouted at them as if they were thieves.
18:30:6:They lived in the desolate valleys, in caves and among the rocks.
18:30:7:They howled like animals among the bushes, huddling together under the nettles.
18:30:8:A worthless and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.
18:30:9:Now, I am the object of their songs, a laughingstock to them.
18:30:10:They despise me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
18:30:11:Because God has broken me and left me helpless, they have thrown off restraint in my presence.
18:30:12:On my right, the rabble rises up; they push me aside and set traps for my feet.
18:30:13:They tear up my path, adding to my destruction without anyone to help me.
18:30:14:As through a wide breach, they advance; amid the ruins, they come rolling in.
18:30:15:Terrors overwhelm me; they chase away my dignity like the wind and my prosperity vanishes like a cloud.
18:30:16:Now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.
18:30:17:Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.
18:30:18:With great force, God seizes my garment; he grasps me by the collar of my tunic.
18:30:19:He hurls me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
18:30:20:I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.
18:30:21:You have turned cruel toward me; with your strong hand, you attack me.
18:30:22:You lift me up on the wind and make me ride it; you toss me about in the storm.
18:30:23:For I know you will bring me to death, to the dwelling place appointed for all the living.
18:30:24:Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
18:30:25:Did I not weep for those in trouble? Was my soul not grieved for the needy?
18:30:26:Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness arrived.
18:30:27:My insides churn without ceasing; days of suffering confront me.
18:30:28:I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
18:30:29:I have become a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches.
18:30:30:My skin turns black and peels; my body burns with fever.
18:30:31:My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing.
18:31:1:In this chapter, Job makes a solemn declaration of his innocence. He swears that he has not looked lustfully at a woman,
18:31:2:or walked secretly with deceit in his heart.
18:31:3:He prays for God's punishment if he has done wrong, knowing that it would be a calamity from the Almighty.
18:31:4:Job is confident that his actions have been just and his steps have not strayed from the path.
18:31:5:He asserts that he has never lied or acted deceitfully,
18:31:6:nor has he ever coveted another man's land or wealth.
18:31:7:His heart has always been pure, and his hands have remained innocent.
18:31:8:He knows that if he had sinned, he would have reaped the consequences, and his descendants would have suffered as well.
18:31:9:Job has never been unfaithful to his wife, nor desired another woman.
18:31:10:He understands that adultery is a sin deserving punishment,
18:31:11:and that it destroys families and communities.
18:31:12:He has always treated his servants fairly and with respect,
18:31:13:recognizing that they too were created by God and deserve justice.
18:31:14:Job has cared for the poor and needy, providing them with food and clothing.
18:31:15:He has not ignored the plight of widows or turned away orphans,
18:31:16:but has shared his resources with them since his youth.
18:31:17:He has shown kindness to strangers, offering them shelter and protection.
18:31:18:Job has not hidden his sins out of fear of public disgrace,
18:31:19:but has always been open and honest in his actions.
18:31:20:He has not worshiped false gods or put his trust in wealth,
18:31:21:knowing that such things cannot truly satisfy the soul.
18:31:22:Job has not rejoiced at the misfortune of others, nor cursed his enemies,
18:31:23:but has prayed for them and sought their well-being.
18:31:24:He has always shared his food with the hungry and opened his home to travelers.
18:31:25:In all these things, Job has remained blameless and upright.
18:31:26:Now, he calls on God to answer him and prove his innocence.
18:31:27:He presents his case before the Almighty, confident that he will be vindicated.
18:31:28:Job longs for the days when he was prosperous and respected by all,
18:31:29:when his words were heeded and his counsel sought after.
18:31:30:He remembers the joy of helping others and the satisfaction of a life well-lived.
18:31:31:Despite his current suffering, Job maintains his integrity and holds fast to his faith in God.
18:31:32:He knows that one day, he will stand before his Creator and be declared righteous.
18:31:33:Until then, he will continue to proclaim his innocence and trust in the Lord's justice.
18:31:34:Job concludes his speech, having made his case before God and man.
18:32:1:So these three men stopped answering Job because he considered himself righteous.
18:32:2:But then, a young man named Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, from the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
18:32:3:Elihu's anger also burned against Job's three friends, because they had not found an answer and yet had condemned Job.
18:32:4:Since Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than him,
18:32:5:when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger flared up.
18:32:6:So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, began to speak, saying, "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore, I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you.
18:32:7:I thought, 'Age should speak, and advanced years should teach wisdom.'
18:32:8:But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
18:32:9:It is not only the old who are wise or the aged who understand what is right.
18:32:10:Therefore, I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.'
18:32:11:Look, I waited for your words; I listened to your reasonings while you searched for what to say.
18:32:12:Yes, I paid close attention to you, but none of you refuted Job or answered his arguments.
18:32:13:Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not a human.'
18:32:14:Job has not directed his words at me, and I will not use your arguments to answer him.
18:32:15:These men are dismayed; they have no more to say; their words have failed them.
18:32:16:Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
18:32:17:I too will have my say; I too will declare what I know.
18:32:18:For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me.
18:32:19:My belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
18:32:20:I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.
18:32:21:I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any person.
18:32:22:For if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.
18:33:1:Listen up, Job! Pay attention to my words and hear me out.
18:33:2:Now, I'm opening my mouth, and my tongue is ready to speak.
18:33:3:My words come from an honest heart, and my lips will speak the truth clearly.
18:33:4:The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
18:33:5:If you can, respond to me; prepare your case and stand before me.
18:33:6:Look, we're both in God's presence; I too was formed from clay.
18:33:7:Don't be afraid of me; my pressure on you won't be too heavy.
18:33:8:You've said it yourself, I heard your words:
18:33:9:'I am pure, without sin; I am innocent and have no guilt.'
18:33:10:But God finds fault with you and considers you his enemy.
18:33:11:He puts chains on your feet and keeps a close watch on all your paths.
18:33:12:However, I must disagree with you, for God is greater than any human.
18:33:13:Why do you argue with him, saying, 'He never answers my questions'?
18:33:14:God speaks in various ways, but people often don't recognize it.
18:33:15:He may speak through dreams or visions in the night when deep sleep falls upon us.
18:33:16:In this way, he opens our ears and gives us warnings to change our ways.
18:33:17:He does this to keep us from pride and protect us from destruction.
18:33:18:He also saves us from death and helps us avoid the grave.
18:33:19:Sometimes he disciplines us with pain on our beds, and we suffer constant distress.
18:33:20:We lose our appetite for food, even the most delicious dishes.
18:33:21:Our bodies waste away, and our bones become visible.
18:33:22:We draw near to the grave, and death's messengers are close at hand.
18:33:23:But if there's an angel to intercede—one out of a thousand—to declare a person's righteousness,
18:33:24:God will have mercy and say, 'Release them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.'
18:33:25:Their bodies will be renewed like a child's; they'll regain their youth.
18:33:26:They'll pray to God, who will accept them, and they'll rejoice in his presence.
18:33:27:They'll confess their sins to others and say, 'I sinned and twisted the truth, but God didn't punish me as I deserved.'
18:33:28:He saved my soul from going to the pit, and now I can enjoy the light of life.'
18:33:29:God does all these things, time and again, to bring people back from the brink.
18:33:30:He wants to show them the light of life and fill them with his love.
18:33:31:Pay attention, Job! Listen to me; be quiet, and let me speak.
18:33:32:If you have something to say, respond; otherwise, listen, and I'll teach you wisdom. 
18:34:1: Elihu continued speaking, saying:
18:34:2: "Listen carefully, you wise men; let me share my knowledge with you all.
18:34:3: We seek to understand what is right and fair, for our hearts long for wisdom.
18:34:4: Job claims he is innocent, but in his own words, he accuses God of injustice.
18:34:5: He says, 'I am without fault, yet I am not considered just; God has taken away my rights.'
18:34:6: Despite being blameless, Job insists that his wounds were inflicted without cause.
18:34:7: Who else speaks like Job, drinking scorn like water?
18:34:8: He associates with evildoers and keeps company with wicked people.
18:34:9: For he claims, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'
18:34:10: So listen to me, you men of understanding: it is unthinkable that God would do wrong or act unjustly.
18:34:11: He repays everyone according to their deeds; he rewards each person as they deserve.
18:34:12: Truly, God will never do evil, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
18:34:13: Who placed the earth under his care? Who created the entire world?
18:34:14: If he were to take back his spirit and gather his breath,
18:34:15: All flesh would perish together, and humanity would return to dust.
18:34:16: If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
18:34:17: Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the righteous and mighty One?
18:34:18: Is it fitting to say to a king, 'You're worthless!' or to nobles, 'You're wicked!'?
18:34:19: God doesn't show favoritism to princes nor does he prefer the rich over the poor, for they are all his creations.
18:34:20: In a moment, they die; at midnight, people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are removed without human intervention.
18:34:21: For God's eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps.
18:34:22: There is no darkness or deep shadow where evildoers can hide themselves.
18:34:23: For God has no need to consider a person further, that they should come before him for judgment.
18:34:24: He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.
18:34:25: Because he knows their deeds, he overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.
18:34:26: He strikes them down as wicked in the open sight of others,
18:34:27: Because they turned aside from following him and did not consider any of his ways,
18:34:28: So that they caused the cry of the poor to reach him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.
18:34:29: When he remains silent, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he watches over both individuals and nations,
18:34:30: So that godless people should not rule, nor lay snares for the people.
18:34:31: Suppose someone says to God, 'I have borne my punishment; I will not offend anymore.
18:34:32: Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will do it no more.'
18:34:33: Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.
18:34:34: Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will declare:
18:34:35: 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'
18:34:36: Oh, that Job would be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!
18:34:37: To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
18:35:1: Elihu continued, saying:
18:35:2: "Do you think it's right when you say, 'I am more righteous than God?'
18:35:3: But you ask, 'What advantage is it to me, and what benefit do I gain by not sinning?'
18:35:4: I will answer you and your friends as well.
18:35:5: Look up at the sky and see; consider the clouds that are higher than you.
18:35:6: If you sin, how does it affect Him? If your transgressions are many, what impact does it have on Him?
18:35:7: If you're righteous, what do you give to Him, or what does He receive from your hand?
18:35:8: Your wickedness affects only people like yourself, and your righteousness benefits only other humans.
18:35:9: People cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
18:35:10: But no one asks, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
18:35:11: who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?'
18:35:12: Then they cry out, but He doesn't answer, because of their pride and arrogance.
18:35:13: Surely God won't listen to empty pleas; the Almighty pays no attention to them.
18:35:14: How much less will He respond when you say you don't see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,
18:35:15: and further, that His anger never punishes, and He doesn't take notice of wickedness.
18:35:16: So Job, you're speaking empty words; your arguments lack knowledge."
18:36:1:Elihu continued, saying:
18:36:2:Be patient with me for a moment, and I will show you wisdom, for I have more to say on God's behalf.
18:36:3:I'll draw from my vast knowledge, and give credit to my Creator for his justice.
18:36:4:You can be sure that my words are true; one who has perfect knowledge is speaking with you.
18:36:5:God is mighty, but he doesn't despise anyone; he is mighty in strength and understanding.
18:36:6:He doesn't let the wicked live, but gives justice to the oppressed.
18:36:7:He never takes his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
18:36:8:If people are bound in chains, caught in cords of affliction,
18:36:9:He tells them what they've done wrong and how arrogantly they've behaved.
18:36:10:He opens their ears to correction and commands them to turn away from evil.
18:36:11:If they listen and obey, they'll spend their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
18:36:12:But if they don't listen, they'll perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
18:36:13:The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he binds them, they don't cry for help.
18:36:14:They die young, like those living a life without purpose.
18:36:15:But God saves the afflicted through their suffering, and opens their ears through adversity.
18:36:16:Indeed, he wanted to lead you out of distress into a spacious place, free from restriction, and set your table with the best food.
18:36:17:But now you're weighed down with the judgment due the wicked; justice and fairness have seized you.
18:36:18:Beware that wrath doesn't entice you into scoffing, and don't let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
18:36:19:Would your wealth or even your endless resources keep you from distress?
18:36:20:Don't long for the night, when people vanish in their place.
18:36:21:Be careful not to turn to evil, for this is why you've been tested by affliction.
18:36:22:God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
18:36:23:Who has prescribed his course for him, or said, 'You've done wrong'?
18:36:24:Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song.
18:36:25:All humanity has seen it; mortals gaze on it from afar.
18:36:26:Yes, God is great, beyond our understanding; the number of his years is past finding out.
18:36:27:He draws up drops of water, which distill as rain from the mist,
18:36:28:Which the clouds pour down and shower abundantly on humankind.
18:36:29:Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, or how he thunders from his dwelling?
18:36:30:See how he scatters his lightning around him, bathing the depths of the sea.
18:36:31:This is how he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.
18:36:32:He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its target.
18:36:33:His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.
18:37:1:Listen carefully to the thunder of God's voice as it echoes around us.
18:37:2:Hear the rumble that comes from His mouth, resounding throughout the sky.
18:37:3:He sends lightning across the heavens, and it reaches the ends of the earth.
18:37:4:Afterward, a roaring sound follows; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not hold back the lightning when His voice is heard.
18:37:5:God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; He does great things beyond our understanding.
18:37:6:He commands the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and the downpour of rain, His mighty shower.
18:37:7:He puts a halt to human activity so that everyone may recognize His work.
18:37:8:The animals retreat to their dens and remain in their lairs.
18:37:9:The storm emerges from its chamber, and the cold from the driving winds.
18:37:10:By God's breath, ice forms, and the expanse of water becomes frozen.
18:37:11:He fills the clouds with moisture, and they scatter His lightning.
18:37:12:They swirl about, directed by His guidance, to fulfill His commands over the face of the whole earth.
18:37:13:Whether for punishment or mercy, He causes these things to happen.
18:37:14:Pay attention to this, Job; stop and consider the wonders of God.
18:37:15:Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes His lightning flash?
18:37:16:Can you understand the layers of the clouds, the wonders of the One who has perfect knowledge?
18:37:17:You, whose garments become hot when the earth lies still under the south wind,
18:37:18:Can you help God stretch out the sky, as hard as a mirror of cast metal?
18:37:19:Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot prepare our case because of our ignorance.
18:37:20:Should He be informed that I want to speak? If someone wishes to converse with Him, what then?
18:37:21:At present, we cannot look at the sun, for it is bright in the sky when the wind has cleared away the clouds.
18:37:22:Out of the north comes golden splendor; around God is awesome majesty.
18:37:23:The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power. In His justice and great righteousness, He does not oppress.
18:37:24:Therefore, people revere Him, for He does not favor the wise in heart.
18:38:1:Then the Lord spoke to Job out of a storm and said:
18:38:2:"Who is this that questions my wisdom with ignorant words?
18:38:3:Get ready to face me; I will question you, and you must answer.
18:38:4:Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.
18:38:5:Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the measuring line across it?
18:38:6:On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone—
18:38:7:while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
18:38:8:Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
18:38:9:when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,
18:38:10:when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,
18:38:11:when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?
18:38:12:Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,
18:38:13:that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
18:38:14:The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
18:38:15:The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.
18:38:16:Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18:38:17:Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
18:38:18:Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.
18:38:19:What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
18:38:20:Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
18:38:21:Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!
18:38:22:Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,
18:38:23:which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?
18:38:24:What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
18:38:25:Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
18:38:26:to water a land where no one lives, an uninhabited desert,
18:38:27:to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
18:38:28:Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
18:38:29:From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
18:38:30:when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?
18:38:31:Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades? Can you loosen Orion's belt?
18:38:32:Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
18:38:33:Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up their dominion over the earth?
18:38:34:Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
18:38:35:Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?
18:38:36:Who gives the ibis wisdom or gives the rooster understanding?
18:38:37:Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
18:38:38:when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
18:38:39:Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions
18:38:40:when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
18:38:41:Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
18:39:1:Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Are you aware of the calving of the wild deer?
18:39:2:Can you count the months they carry their young, or do you know the time when they deliver?
18:39:3:They crouch down and bring forth their offspring; their labor pains are over.
18:39:4:Their young ones grow strong in the open field; they leave and never return to their mothers.
18:39:5:Who set the wild donkey free? Who untied its ropes?
18:39:6:I assigned the wilderness as its home and the salt flats as its dwelling place.
18:39:7:It laughs at the commotion of the city and doesn't hear the driver's shouts.
18:39:8:It roams the hills for pasture, searching for any green thing.
18:39:9:Will the wild ox agree to serve you, or will it spend the night by your manger?
18:39:10:Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to plow the furrows? Or will it harrow the valleys behind you?
18:39:11:Can you rely on its great strength and entrust your heavy work to it?
18:39:12:Can you trust it to bring home your grain and gather it into your threshing floor?
18:39:13:The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but are they the pinions and plumage of a stork?
18:39:14:For she leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust.
18:39:15:She forgets that a foot may crush them, or that a wild animal may trample them.
18:39:16:She treats her young harshly, as if they were not her own, unconcerned that her labor was in vain.
18:39:17:For God has not given her wisdom or understanding.
18:39:18:Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
18:39:19:Do you give the horse its strength or clothe its neck with a flowing mane?
18:39:20:Do you make it leap like a locust, with its majestic snorting striking terror?
18:39:21:It paws fiercely in the valley and rejoices in its strength; it charges into battle.
18:39:22:It laughs at fear, unafraid; it does not shy away from the sword.
18:39:23:The quiver rattles against its side, along with the flashing spear and lance.
18:39:24:In frenzied excitement, it devours the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
18:39:25:At the blast of the trumpet, it snorts, 'Aha!' It catches the scent of battle from afar, the shouts of commanders and the battle cry.
18:39:26:Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread its wings toward the south?
18:39:27:Does the eagle soar at your command and build its nest on high?
18:39:28:It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; its stronghold is on a rocky crag.
18:39:29:From there it searches for food; its eyes detect it from far away.
18:39:30:Its young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there it is.
18:40:1:Moreover, the Lord addressed Job and said,
18:40:2:"Is it right for a critic to argue with the Almighty? Let the one who corrects God answer this."
18:40:3:Then Job replied to the Lord,
18:40:4:"I am insignificant; what can I say in response? I will put my hand over my mouth.
18:40:5:I have spoken once, but I won't do it again; twice, but I will go no further."
18:40:6:Again, the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm, saying,
18:40:7:"Stand up like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18:40:8:Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
18:40:9:Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like His?
18:40:10:Now adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor.
18:40:11:Unleash the fury of your wrath; look at all who are proud and bring them low.
18:40:12:Look at all who are proud and humble them; crush the wicked where they stand.
18:40:13:Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
18:40:14:Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
18:40:15:Consider now the behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox.
18:40:16:See the strength in his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.
18:40:17:His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
18:40:18:His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.
18:40:19:He is the foremost of God's works; only his Maker can approach him with a sword.
18:40:20:The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.
18:40:21:He lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
18:40:22:The lotus plants cover him with their shade; the willows by the stream surround him.
18:40:23:When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
18:40:24:Can anyone capture him by the eyes or pierce his nose with a snare?
18:41:1:Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down its tongue with a rope?
18:41:2:Can you put a cord through its nose or pierce its jaw with a hook?
18:41:3:Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words?
18:41:4:Will it make an agreement with you for you to take it as your servant forever?
18:41:5:Can you play with it like a bird, or put it on a leash for your young girls?
18:41:6:Will traders barter for it? Will they divide it among the merchants?
18:41:7:Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?
18:41:8:Lay your hand on it; remember the battle—you won't do it again!
18:41:9:Indeed, any hope of overcoming it is false; the mere sight of it is overpowering.
18:41:10:No one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then dares to stand against me?
18:41:11:Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
18:41:12:I will not fail to speak of Leviathan's limbs, its strength, and its graceful form.
18:41:13:Who can strip off its outer coat? Who can approach it with a bridle?
18:41:14:Who dares open the doors of its mouth, ringed about with fearsome teeth?
18:41:15:Its back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
18:41:16:Each is so close to the next that no air can pass between them.
18:41:17:They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
18:41:18:Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the rays of dawn.
18:41:19:Flames stream from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
18:41:20:Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
18:41:21:Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth.
18:41:22:Strength resides in its neck; dismay goes before it.
18:41:23:The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
18:41:24:Its chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
18:41:25:When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before its thrashing.
18:41:26:The sword that reaches it has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
18:41:27:Iron it treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
18:41:28:Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones are like chaff to it.
18:41:29:A club seems to it but a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
18:41:30:Its undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
18:41:31:It makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
18:41:32:It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had white hair.
18:41:33:Nothing on earth is its equal—a creature without fear.
18:41:34:It looks down on all that are haughty; it is king over all that are proud.
18:42:1:Then Job responded to the Lord, saying:
18:42:2:I now understand that you can do all things and no plan of yours can be thwarted.
18:42:3:You asked, 'Who is this who darkens counsel without knowledge?' Indeed, I spoke of things I didn't understand, matters too wonderful for me to know.
18:42:4:You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'
18:42:5:Before, I had only heard about you, but now my eyes have seen you.
18:42:6:Therefore, I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.
18:42:7:After the Lord had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My anger burns against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.
18:42:8:Now, take seven bulls and seven rams, go to my servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has."
18:42:9:So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did as the Lord commanded them, and the Lord accepted Job's prayer.
18:42:10:When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes, giving him twice as much as he had before.
18:42:11:All his brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances came to visit him and feasted with him in his house. They consoled and comforted him for all the trouble the Lord had brought upon him, and each gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
18:42:12:The Lord blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
18:42:13:He also had seven sons and three daughters.
18:42:14:He named the first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-Happuch.
18:42:15:In all the land, there were no women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers.
18:42:16:After this, Job lived 140 years, and he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
18:42:17:And so, Job died, old and full of years.
