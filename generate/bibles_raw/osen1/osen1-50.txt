50:1:1:From Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy ones in Philippi who follow Christ Jesus, along with the overseers and deacons:
50:1:2:May you experience grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50:1:3:I always thank my God when I remember you in my prayers,
50:1:4:because I continually hear about your love and faithfulness towards the Lord Jesus and all his people.
50:1:5:Your partnership in spreading the good news from the first day until now has been a great encouragement.
50:1:6:I am confident that the one who began a good work in you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ.
50:1:7:It's right for me to feel this way about you because I hold you dear in my heart. We share in God's grace, whether I'm in chains or defending and confirming the gospel.
50:1:8:God is my witness how much I long for you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50:1:9:My prayer is that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,
50:1:10:so you can discern what is best and be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,
50:1:11:filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
50:1:12:I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.
50:1:13:As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
50:1:14:Because of my chains, most of the believers have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
50:1:15:Some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, while others do so out of goodwill.
50:1:16:The latter do so in love, knowing that I am here for the defense of the gospel.
50:1:17:But the former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, intending to stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
50:1:18:But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this, I rejoice.
50:1:19:For I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my situation will turn out for my deliverance.
50:1:20:My eager expectation and hope are that I will not be ashamed but will have sufficient courage to honor Christ, whether by life or by death.
50:1:21:For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better.
50:1:22:If I continue to live in this world, I can do fruitful work for Christ. Yet what I choose, I cannot decide.
50:1:23:I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better;
50:1:24:but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the flesh.
50:1:25:Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
50:1:26:so that through my being with you again, your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.
50:1:27:Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel.
50:1:28:Do not be frightened by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God.
50:1:29:For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him,
50:1:30:having the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
50:2:1:So, if there's any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, and any fellowship in the Spirit, or any affection and sympathy,
50:2:2:then complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, and being united in spirit and purpose.
50:2:3:Don't do anything out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.
50:2:4:Each of you should not only look out for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.
50:2:5:Adopt the same attitude that Christ Jesus had:
50:2:6:Though he was God, he didn't cling to his divine status; instead, he emptied himself, taking on the form of a servant and being born as a human.
50:2:7:He humbled himself further by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!
50:2:8:Because of this, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name above all names,
50:2:9:so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow—in heaven, on earth, and under the earth—
50:2:10:and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50:2:11:Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
50:2:12:for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.
50:2:13:Do everything without complaining or arguing,
50:2:14:so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe
50:2:15:as you hold firmly to the word of life. Then I can boast on the day of Christ that I didn't run or labor for nothing.
50:2:16:Even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
50:2:17:In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
50:2:18:I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be encouraged by news about you.
50:2:19:I have no one else like him, who genuinely cares for your well-being.
50:2:20:For everyone else looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50:2:21:But you know Timothy's proven character, that he has served with me in spreading the gospel like a son with his father.
50:2:22:Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
50:2:23:And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon as well.
50:2:24:But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.
50:2:25:He has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
50:2:26:Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
50:2:27:So I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
50:2:28:Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,
50:2:29:because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.
50:3:1:Finally, my friends, rejoice in the Lord. It's no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it's a safeguard for you.
50:3:2:Beware of those who do evil, the so-called "circumcision group."
50:3:3:For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
50:3:4:Though I could also put confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks they have reason to trust in the flesh, I have more:
50:3:5:Circumcised on the eighth day, from the people of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
50:3:6:Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding righteousness under the law, blameless.
50:3:7:But whatever was an advantage to me, I now consider loss because of Christ.
50:3:8:Yes, I count everything as loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake, I've lost all things and consider them rubbish, so that I may gain Christ
50:3:9:And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ—the righteousness from God based on faith.
50:3:10:My goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection, and to share in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
50:3:11:Hoping that I might attain the resurrection from the dead.
50:3:12:Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
50:3:13:Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it yet. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
50:3:14:I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
50:3:15:So let all of us who are mature think this way, and if you think differently about anything, God will reveal that to you as well.
50:3:16:However, let us live up to what we have already attained.
50:3:17:Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and pay attention to those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
50:3:18:For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ, as I have often told you and now say again with tears.
50:3:19:Their end is destruction, their god is their appetite, they glory in their shame, and their minds are set on earthly things.
50:3:20:But our citizenship is in heaven, from which we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
50:3:21:Who will transform our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself.
50:4:1:So, my dear brothers and sisters, whom I long for, you are my joy and crown; stand firm in the Lord this way, loved ones.
50:4:2:I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.
50:4:3:Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.
50:4:4:Always be joyful in the Lord; I'll say it again, rejoice!
50:4:5:Let your gentle spirit be evident to all people. The Lord is near.
50:4:6:Don't worry about anything; instead, in every situation, through prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
50:4:7:And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
50:4:8:Finally, friends, whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
50:4:9:Put into practice what you have learned and received from me, both by word and example, and the God of peace will be with you.
50:4:10:I am grateful to the Lord that you have renewed your concern for me. You were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.
50:4:11:Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance.
50:4:12:I know how to live humbly, and I know how to enjoy abundance. In every situation, I have learned the secret of being well-fed and going hungry, having plenty and lacking.
50:4:13:I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
50:4:14:Nevertheless, you did well to share in my hardship.
50:4:15:You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone.
50:4:16:Even in Thessalonica, you sent help more than once for my needs.
50:4:17:Not that I seek gifts, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.
50:4:18:I have received everything in full and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
50:4:19:And my God will supply all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.
50:4:20:To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
50:4:21:Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.
50:4:22:All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
50:4:23:The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
