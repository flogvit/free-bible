22:1:1:Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine.
22:1:2:Your fragrance is like fine perfume; that's why the young women adore you.
22:1:3:Take me away with you; let us hurry! The king has brought me into his chambers.
22:1:4:We rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!
22:1:5:I am dark but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
22:1:6:Don't stare at me because I am dark, for the sun has tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me take care of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have neglected.
22:1:7:Tell me, you whom I love, where do you graze your flock? Where do you rest your sheep at midday? Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions?
22:1:8:If you don't know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
22:1:9:To me, my love, you are like a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22:1:10:Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
22:1:11:We will make you gold ornaments studded with silver.
22:1:12:While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
22:1:13:My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
22:1:14:My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
22:1:15:How beautiful you are, my love! How very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.
22:1:16:How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.
22:1:17:The beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are made of fir.
22:2:1:I am the spring crocus of Sharon, a lily among the valleys.
22:2:2:Like a lily among thorns, so is my love among the young women.
22:2:3:As an apple tree stands out among the trees of the forest, so does my beloved among the young men. I delight in sitting in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
22:2:4:He brings me into the banquet hall; his banner over me is love.
22:2:5:Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
22:2:6:His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
22:2:7:Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: do not awaken or stir up love until it pleases.
22:2:8:Listen! My beloved! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22:2:9:My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
22:2:10:My beloved spoke and said to me, "Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, come with me.
22:2:11:For see, the winter has passed, the rains are over and gone.
22:2:12:Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
22:2:13:The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me."
22:2:14:My dove, hidden in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22:2:15:Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.
22:2:16:My beloved is mine, and I am his; he browses among the lilies.
22:2:17:Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.
22:3:1:In my bed at night, I searched for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but couldn't find him.
22:3:2:I'll get up now and roam the city, through the streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but couldn't find him.
22:3:3:The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?" I asked them.
22:3:4:Just as I passed by them, I found the one my heart loves. I held on to him and wouldn't let him go until I brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who conceived me.
22:3:5:Promise me, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and the wild deer, not to awaken or stir up love until it desires to arise.
22:3:6:Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, and all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
22:3:7:Look, it is Solomon's carriage, surrounded by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel.
22:3:8:All of them wear swords and are experts in war; each has his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night.
22:3:9:King Solomon made a palanquin for himself out of the wood of Lebanon.
22:3:10:He made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric, and its interior lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Jerusalem.
22:3:11:Go out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon, wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.
22:4:1:You are so beautiful, my love! Your eyes behind your veil are like doves. Your hair cascades down like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.
22:4:2:Your teeth are as white as newly shorn sheep freshly washed, each one perfectly matched with its twin.
22:4:3:Your lips are like scarlet ribbon, and your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22:4:4:Your neck is as elegant as the tower of David, built with layers of stones, hung with shields of a thousand warriors.
22:4:5:Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, grazing among the lilies.
22:4:6:Before the day breaks and shadows flee, I will hurry to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
22:4:7:You are absolutely stunning, my love, flawless in every way.
22:4:8:Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the peak of Amana, from the heights of Senir and Hermon, where lions dwell and leopards roam.
22:4:9:You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with just one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22:4:10:How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! Your love is far more pleasing than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume surpasses all spices.
22:4:11:Your lips, my bride, drip honey; honey and milk are under your tongue, and the scent of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22:4:12:A garden locked is my sister, my bride; a spring sealed up, a fountain enclosed.
22:4:13:Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, henna and nard.
22:4:14:Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, along with every finest spice.
22:4:15:A garden fountain, a well of living water, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
22:4:16:Awaken, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
22:5:1:I have come to my garden, my sister and bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
22:5:2:While I slept, my heart was awake. A sound! My love is knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night."
22:5:3:I have taken off my robe—how can I put it on again? I have washed my feet—how can I dirty them again?
22:5:4:My love thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart pounded for him.
22:5:5:I rose up to open for my love, and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.
22:5:6:I opened the door for my love, but he had turned away and was gone. My soul failed when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave no answer.
22:5:7:The watchmen found me as they went about the city; they struck me, they wounded me; the guards of the walls took away my veil from me.
22:5:8:I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my love, tell him that I am lovesick.
22:5:9:What makes your love so special, most beautiful among women? What makes your love so special, that you charge us like this?
22:5:10:My love is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
22:5:11:His head is pure gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
22:5:12:His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, perched over a pool.
22:5:13:His cheeks are like beds of spices, towers of perfume. His lips are like lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh.
22:5:14:His arms are rods of gold set with jewels. His body is polished ivory, adorned with sapphires.
22:5:15:His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
22:5:16:His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my love, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
22:6:1:Where has your beloved gone, most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, so we may help you look for him?
22:6:2:My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and gather lilies.
22:6:3:I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; he feeds among the lilies.
22:6:4:You are as stunning, my love, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as awe-inspiring as bannered armies.
22:6:5:Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.
22:6:6:Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that have come up from the washing; each one has its twin, and none among them is missing.
22:6:7:Like a slice of pomegranate, your temples glow behind your veil.
22:6:8:There may be sixty queens and eighty concubines, and countless young women,
22:6:9:but my dove, my perfect one, is unique—she is her mother's only daughter, her mother's favorite. The young women see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.
22:6:10:Who is this who appears like the dawn, as beautiful as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?
22:6:11:I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.
22:6:12:Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
22:6:13:Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may gaze upon you! What will you see in the Shulammite? As it were, a dance of two camps.
22:7:1:Your graceful steps are like those of a noble princess, my love. Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a skilled craftsman.
22:7:2:Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
22:7:3:Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22:7:4:Your neck is as elegant as an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
22:7:5:Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, and the flowing locks of your hair are like royal tapestries; the king is held captive by its tresses.
22:7:6:How beautiful and pleasant you are, my love, with your delightful charms!
22:7:7:Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of fruit.
22:7:8:I said, "I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.
22:7:9:Your mouth is like the finest wine, flowing smoothly for my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth.
22:7:10:I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.
22:7:11:Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night among the henna blossoms.
22:7:12:Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
22:7:13:The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my beloved.
22:8:1:We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?
22:8:2:If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver; but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
22:8:3:I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. In this way, I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace.
22:8:4:Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
22:8:5:My own vineyard is before me. You, Solomon, may have the thousand, and those who tend the fruit, two hundred.
22:8:6:Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion as unyielding as the grave. Its flames are a blazing fire, the very flame of the Lord.
22:8:7:Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it. If someone were to offer all the wealth of their house for love, they would be utterly scorned.
22:8:8:We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?
22:8:9:If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver; but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
22:8:10:I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. In this way, I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace.
22:8:11:Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
22:8:12:My own vineyard is before me. You, Solomon, may have the thousand, and those who tend the fruit, two hundred.
22:8:13:You who dwell in the gardens, friends are listening for your voice; let me hear it.
22:8:14:Hurry, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
