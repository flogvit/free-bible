41:1:1:This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
41:1:2:As it was written in the prophet Isaiah, "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
41:1:3:"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight.'"
41:1:4:John appeared, baptizing people in the desert and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41:1:5:People from all over Judea and Jerusalem went out to him, confessing their sins and being baptized by him in the Jordan River.
41:1:6:John wore clothing made of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41:1:7:He preached, saying, "After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
41:1:8:I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41:1:9:At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41:1:10:Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
41:1:11:A voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son; in you, I am well pleased."
41:1:12:The Spirit immediately drove Jesus into the wilderness.
41:1:13:He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended to him.
41:1:14:After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
41:1:15:"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"
41:1:16:As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
41:1:17:"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of people."
41:1:18:At once, they left their nets and followed him.
41:1:19:Going a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
41:1:20:Jesus called them, and immediately they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
41:1:21:They went to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
41:1:22:The people were amazed at his teaching because he taught them as one who had authority, not like the teachers of the law.
41:1:23:In their synagogue, there was a man with an impure spirit.
41:1:24:He cried out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
41:1:25:Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet! Come out of him!"
41:1:26:The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
41:1:27:The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits, and they obey him."
41:1:28:News about Jesus spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
41:1:29:After leaving the synagogue, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
41:1:30:Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
41:1:31:He went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to wait on them.
41:1:32:That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed.
41:1:33:The whole town gathered at the door.
41:1:34:Jesus healed many who had various diseases and drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
41:1:35:Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a solitary place where he prayed.
41:1:36:Simon and his companions went to look for him.
41:1:37:When they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you!"
41:1:38:Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
41:1:39:So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
41:1:40:A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
41:1:41:Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched the man, and said, "I am willing; be clean!"
41:1:42:Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
41:1:43:Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
41:1:44:"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
41:1:45:Instead, the man went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
41:2:1:One day, Jesus went back to Capernaum, and soon people heard that he was at home.
41:2:2:Many gathered there, filling the house, and there wasn't any room left, not even outside the door. Jesus spoke God's word to them.
41:2:3:Four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat.
41:2:4:Because of the crowd, they couldn't get him inside to see Jesus, so they climbed onto the roof and removed some tiles. Then they lowered the man on his mat through the opening.
41:2:5:Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "My friend, your sins are forgiven."
41:2:6:Some teachers of the Law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
41:2:7:"Why does he speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41:2:8:Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why do you have such thoughts in your hearts?
41:2:9:Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
41:2:10:But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
41:2:11:"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
41:2:12:The man got up immediately, took his mat, and walked out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, "We've never seen anything like this before!"
41:2:13:Afterward, Jesus went out beside the lake, where a large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
41:2:14:As he walked along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And Levi got up and followed him.
41:2:15:Later, Jesus had dinner at Levi's house, and many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd following Jesus.
41:2:16:When the teachers of the Law who were Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
41:2:17:Hearing this, Jesus said, "It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I've come to call not the righteous, but sinners."
41:2:18:One day, when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples fast like John's disciples and the Pharisees do?"
41:2:19:Jesus replied, "Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
41:2:20:But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
41:2:21:"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
41:2:22:And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins."
41:2:23:One Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. As they walked along, his disciples began to pick some heads of grain.
41:2:24:The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
41:2:25:Jesus answered, "Haven't you ever read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
41:2:26:He entered the house of God during the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests were allowed to eat. He also gave some to his companions."
41:2:27:Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.
41:2:28:So, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
41:3:1:Jesus went into the synagogue again, and there was a man with a paralyzed hand.
41:3:2:Some people were watching Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath, so they could accuse him of breaking the law.
41:3:3:He said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
41:3:4:Then Jesus asked them, "Is it lawful to do good or harm on the Sabbath, to save life or kill?" But they remained silent.
41:3:5:Looking around at them with anger and sorrow at their stubborn hearts, he told the man, "Stretch out your hand." The man did as he was told, and his hand was completely restored.
41:3:6:The Pharisees left the synagogue and immediately began plotting with the Herodians how they might destroy Jesus.
41:3:7:Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him. People also came from Judea,
41:3:8:Jerusalem, Idumea, the region across the Jordan, and the area around Tyre and Sidon. These crowds came to him because they had heard about all he was doing.
41:3:9:To avoid being crushed by the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him.
41:3:10:He had healed many people, and as a result, those who were sick were pushing forward to touch him.
41:3:11:Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
41:3:12:But Jesus sternly warned them not to reveal who he was.
41:3:13:He went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
41:3:14:He appointed twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles, to be with him, to be sent out to preach,
41:3:15:and to have authority to drive out demons.
41:3:16:These are the twelve he chose: Simon (whom he named Peter),
41:3:17:James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, meaning "Sons of Thunder"),
41:3:18:Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
41:3:19:and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray him.
41:3:20:Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples could not even eat.
41:3:21:When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, saying, "He's lost his mind."
41:3:22:The teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He's possessed by Beelzebul! He drives out demons by the prince of demons."
41:3:23:Calling them over, Jesus spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?
41:3:24:If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
41:3:25:And if a house is divided against itself, it will not be able to stand.
41:3:26:So if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
41:3:27:In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.
41:3:28:Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,
41:3:29:but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin."
41:3:30:He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."
41:3:31:Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
41:3:32:A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."
41:3:33:"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.
41:3:34:Looking at those seated in a circle around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
41:3:35:For whoever does the will of God is my brother, sister, and mother."
41:4:1:Once, Jesus started teaching by the lakeside. A large crowd gathered around him, so he climbed into a boat and sat down while the people remained on the shore.
41:4:2:He used parables to teach them many things, and in his instruction, he said:
41:4:3:"Listen up! A farmer went out to sow seeds.
41:4:4:As he scattered the seeds, some fell along the path, where birds came and ate them up.
41:4:5:Other seeds landed on rocky ground, where they had little soil. They sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.
41:4:6:But when the sun rose, the plants were scorched, and since they had no deep roots, they withered away.
41:4:7:Some seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so they didn't produce any grain.
41:4:8:Still, other seeds fell on good soil, where they grew, multiplied, and produced a crop—some thirty, some sixty, and some even a hundred times what was sown."
41:4:9:Then Jesus added, "If you have ears, pay attention."
41:4:10:When he was alone with his followers, they asked him about the meaning of the parables.
41:4:11:He replied, "You are given the secret of God's kingdom, but for those on the outside, everything is expressed in parables.
41:4:12:This way, they may see but not perceive, and hear but not understand; otherwise, they might turn and be forgiven."
41:4:13:Jesus then explained the parable of the sower to them:
41:4:14:"The seed represents the word. When it falls along the path, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
41:4:15:Similarly, when seeds land on rocky ground, people hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no deep roots.
41:4:16:They endure for a while, but when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
41:4:17:The seeds among thorns represent those who hear the word,
41:4:18:but life's worries, the deceitfulness of wealth, and other desires choke the word, making it unfruitful.
41:4:19:Lastly, the seeds sown on good soil symbolize those who hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times what was sown."
41:4:20:He continued, "Is a lamp brought in to be hidden under a basket or put under a bed? Shouldn't it be placed on a stand?
41:4:21:Nothing is hidden that won't be revealed, and nothing is concealed that won't be brought to light.
41:4:22:If you have ears, listen carefully.
41:4:23:Consider carefully what you hear. The measure you give will determine the measure you receive, and even more will be added.
41:4:24:For whoever has, more will be given; but whoever doesn't have, even what little they possess will be taken away."
41:4:25:Jesus shared another parable: "The kingdom of God is like a man scattering seed on the ground.
41:4:26:Night and day, whether he's awake or asleep, the seed sprouts and grows, but he doesn't know how.
41:4:27:The earth produces the crop by itself—first the stalk, then the head, and finally the full grain in the head.
41:4:28:When the grain is ripe, the man harvests it with a sickle because it's time."
41:4:29:He also said, "What can we compare the kingdom of God to? What parable can we use?
41:4:30:It's like a mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds on earth.
41:4:31:Yet when planted, it grows into the largest of all garden plants, with branches so big that birds can perch in its shade."
41:4:32:Jesus used many similar parables to teach the people as much as they could understand.
41:4:33:He always used parables when speaking to them, but he explained everything to his disciples in private.
41:4:34:That day, evening came, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's cross over to the other side of the lake."
41:4:35:They left the crowd behind, took Jesus along in the boat just as he was, and set sail. Other boats followed.
41:4:36:As they sailed, a fierce storm arose. Waves broke over the boat, filling it with water.
41:4:37:Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, "Teacher, don't you care that we're about to drown?"
41:4:38:He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down, and there was complete calm.
41:4:39:He asked them, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41:4:40:Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, "Who is this man, that even the wind and the waves obey him?"
41:5:1:They arrived on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gerasenes.
41:5:2:As Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
41:5:3:This man lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him, not even with chains.
41:5:4:He had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he broke them apart and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
41:5:5:Night and day in the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
41:5:6:Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell at his feet.
41:5:7:In a loud voice, he shouted, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!"
41:5:8:For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
41:5:9:Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, for we are many."
41:5:10:And he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the area.
41:5:11:A large herd of pigs was feeding nearby on the hillside.
41:5:12:The demons pleaded with Jesus, "Send us into the pigs, so we can enter them."
41:5:13:Jesus gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.
41:5:14:Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and people went out to see what had happened.
41:5:15:They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
41:5:16:Those who had seen it told the others what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.
41:5:17:Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
41:5:18:As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
41:5:19:Jesus did not let him but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
41:5:20:So the man went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.
41:5:21:When Jesus had crossed back over by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
41:5:22:Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.
41:5:23:He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."
41:5:24:So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.
41:5:25:In the crowd was a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
41:5:26:She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, but instead of getting better, she grew worse.
41:5:27:When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.
41:5:28:For she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
41:5:29:Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
41:5:30:At once, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
41:5:31:His disciples replied, "You see the people crowding against you, and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"
41:5:32:But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
41:5:33:Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
41:5:34:He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
41:5:35:While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"
41:5:36:Hearing this, Jesus told them, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
41:5:37:He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
41:5:38:When they arrived at the house of Jairus, he saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
41:5:39:He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."
41:5:40:They laughed at him, but he put them all out. He took the child's father and mother and his three disciples and went in where the child was.
41:5:41:Taking her by the hand, Jesus said to her, "Talitha koum!" which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"
41:5:42:Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this, they were utterly astonished.
41:5:43:Jesus gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
41:6:1:Jesus left that place and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
41:6:2:When the Sabbath came, he started teaching in the synagogue. Many who heard him were amazed, asking, "Where did this man get these things? What's this wisdom given to him? And how can he perform such miracles?
41:6:3:Isn't this the carpenter, Mary's son, and brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren't his sisters living here with us?" They took offense at him.
41:6:4:But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own family."
41:6:5:Because of their unbelief, he couldn't do any significant miracles there, except for laying his hands on a few sick people and healing them.
41:6:6:He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then he went around to other villages, teaching.
41:6:7:He called the twelve disciples together and sent them out two by two, giving them authority over evil spirits.
41:6:8:He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts.
41:6:9:They were to wear sandals but not take an extra shirt.
41:6:10:He told them, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
41:6:11:If any place doesn't welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet as you leave, as a testimony against them."
41:6:12:So they went out and preached that people should repent.
41:6:13:They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil, healing them.
41:6:14:King Herod heard about Jesus, because his fame had spread. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that's why he can perform miracles."
41:6:15:Others said, "He's Elijah." Still others claimed, "He's a prophet, like one of the prophets from long ago."
41:6:16:But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"
41:6:17:For Herod himself had ordered John's arrest and imprisonment, to please his wife Herodias, who had been the wife of his brother Philip.
41:6:18:John had told Herod, "It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41:6:19:So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't,
41:6:20:because Herod feared John, knowing he was a righteous and holy man, and protected him. When he heard John speak, he was greatly perplexed, yet he liked listening to him.
41:6:21:Finally, an opportune time came. On Herod's birthday, he gave a banquet for his high officials, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
41:6:22:When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."
41:6:23:He promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask, I'll give it to you, up to half my kingdom."
41:6:24:She went out and asked her mother, "What should I request?" Her mother answered, "The head of John the Baptist."
41:6:25:The girl hurried back to the king and said, "I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter right now."
41:6:26:The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and his guests, he didn't want to refuse her.
41:6:27:So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,
41:6:28:brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl, who then presented it to her mother.
41:6:29:When John's disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
41:6:30:The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
41:6:31:He said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest." For many were coming and going, and they had no time even to eat.
41:6:32:So they went away in a boat to a remote place by themselves.
41:6:33:But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.
41:6:34:When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
41:6:35:By this time it was getting late, and his disciples approached him, saying, "This is a remote place, and it's already very late.
41:6:36:Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat."
41:6:37:But Jesus answered, "You give them something to eat." They said, "Should we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give it to them to eat?"
41:6:38:He asked them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five loaves and two fish."
41:6:39:Then Jesus directed them to seat everyone in groups on the green grass.
41:6:40:So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41:6:41:Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, gave thanks, and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41:6:42:Everyone ate and was satisfied,
41:6:43:and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
41:6:44:The number of men who had eaten was five thousand.
41:6:45:Immediately afterward, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
41:6:46:After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
41:6:47:When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
41:6:48:He saw the disciples straining at the oars because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn, he went out to them, walking on the lake. He intended to pass by them,
41:6:49:but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost and cried out,
41:6:50:for they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It's me. Don't be afraid."
41:6:51:Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,
41:6:52:for they had not understood the significance of the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
41:6:53:When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
41:6:54:As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus
41:6:55:and ran throughout the whole region, bringing the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
41:6:56:And wherever he went—into villages, towns, or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
41:7:1:One day, the Pharisees and some teachers of the law gathered around Jesus. They had come from Jerusalem.
41:7:2:They saw that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, meaning they hadn't washed them.
41:7:3:The Pharisees and all the Jews follow the traditions of their elders, which include washing their hands before eating to stay ritually clean.
41:7:4:When they return from the marketplace, they also wash themselves and observe many other traditions like washing cups, pitchers, and kettles.
41:7:5:So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of the elders? They eat with unclean hands."
41:7:6:Jesus replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
41:7:7:Their worship is in vain, for they teach human rules as if they were my commandments.'
41:7:8:You have let go of God's commands and hold on to human traditions."
41:7:9:He continued, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to uphold your own traditions!
41:7:10:For example, Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'
41:7:11:But you say that if someone declares what might have been used to help their parents as 'Corban' (meaning a gift dedicated to God),
41:7:12:then they no longer need to do anything for their parents.
41:7:13:In this way, you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this."
41:7:14:Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this:
41:7:15:Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it's what comes out of a person that defiles them."
41:7:16:(If there were any who had ears to hear, let them hear.)
41:7:17:When Jesus left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.
41:7:18:He said, "Are you so dull? Don't you see that nothing entering a person from the outside can defile them?
41:7:19:For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)
41:7:20:He continued, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them.
41:7:21:For from within, out of people's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,
41:7:22:adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.
41:7:23:All these evils come from inside and defile a person."
41:7:24:Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He didn't want anyone to know he was there, but he couldn't keep his presence a secret.
41:7:25:Soon a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit heard about him. She came and fell at his feet.
41:7:26:The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41:7:27:He told her, "First let the children eat all they want, for it's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
41:7:28:"Lord," she replied, "even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
41:7:29:Then he said to her, "Because of your reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."
41:7:30:She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.
41:7:31:Jesus left Tyre and went through Sidon, then down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
41:7:32:Some people brought a man who was deaf and could hardly speak. They begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
41:7:33:Jesus took the man aside, away from the crowd, put his fingers into the man's ears, and spit and touched the man's tongue.
41:7:34:Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to the man, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!")
41:7:35:At once, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly.
41:7:36:Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.
41:7:37:People were overwhelmed with amazement, saying, "He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
41:8:1:During that time, there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said to them,
41:8:2:"I feel compassion for these people because they've been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat.
41:8:3:If I send them away hungry, they'll become weak on their journey home. Some of them have come from far away."
41:8:4:His disciples replied, "How can we find enough food here in this remote place to feed such a large crowd?"
41:8:5:Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven."
41:8:6:He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute. They then shared the bread with the crowd.
41:8:7:They also had a few small fish. Jesus blessed them and told the disciples to distribute the fish as well.
41:8:8:Everyone ate and was satisfied. Afterward, the disciples collected seven baskets full of leftover pieces.
41:8:9:About four thousand people were present. After feeding them, Jesus sent them away.
41:8:10:Immediately, he boarded a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
41:8:11:The Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, demanding a sign from heaven to test him.
41:8:12:Deeply sighing, Jesus said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I tell you, no sign will be given to it."
41:8:13:Leaving them behind, he got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
41:8:14:The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
41:8:15:Jesus warned them, "Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Herod."
41:8:16:The disciples discussed this among themselves, saying, "He must be saying this because we have no bread."
41:8:17:Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus asked, "Why are you talking about not having any bread? Do you still not understand or perceive? Are your hearts hardened?
41:8:18:Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? Don't you remember
41:8:19:when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of leftovers did you collect?" They answered, "Twelve."
41:8:20:"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of leftovers did you collect?" They replied, "Seven."
41:8:21:Then Jesus said to them, "How can you still not understand?"
41:8:22:They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to Jesus, begging him to touch him.
41:8:23:Taking the blind man by the hand, Jesus led him outside the village. After spitting on the man's eyes and placing his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"
41:8:24:The man looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees walking around."
41:8:25:Once more, Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes. The man's sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
41:8:26:Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go back into the village or tell anyone there."
41:8:27:Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
41:8:28:They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
41:8:29:Then Jesus asked, "But what about you? Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."
41:8:30:Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
41:8:31:He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, be killed, and after three days rise again.
41:8:32:He spoke openly about this. Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him.
41:8:33:But Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, then rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind me, Satan! You don't have your mind set on God's interests, but on human interests."
41:8:34:Calling the crowd along with his disciples, Jesus said, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
41:8:35:For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.
41:8:36:What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
41:8:37:Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
41:8:38:If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."
41:9:1:One day, Jesus said to them, "I assure you that some standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power."
41:9:2:After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain where they were alone. There, he was transformed in front of them.
41:9:3:His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone could bleach them on earth.
41:9:4:Elijah and Moses appeared, talking with Jesus.
41:9:5:Peter spoke up, saying, "Teacher, it's great for us to be here! Let's make three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41:9:6:He didn't know what to say because they were all so frightened.
41:9:7:A cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him!"
41:9:8:Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one else but Jesus alone with them.
41:9:9:As they descended the mountain, Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41:9:10:They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
41:9:11:They asked Jesus, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
41:9:12:He replied, "Elijah does come first and restores everything. But why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?
41:9:13:I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written about him."
41:9:14:When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them and scribes arguing with them.
41:9:15:As soon as the crowd saw Jesus, they were astonished and ran to greet him.
41:9:16:He asked, "What are you arguing about?"
41:9:17:A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought my son to you because he has a spirit that makes him mute.
41:9:18:Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they couldn't."
41:9:19:Jesus replied, "You faithless generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
41:9:20:They brought the boy to Jesus, and when the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth.
41:9:21:Jesus asked the father, "How long has this been happening?" The father replied, "Since he was a child.
41:9:22:It has often tried to kill him by throwing him into fire or water. But if you can do anything, please have compassion and help us."
41:9:23:Jesus said, "If you can believe, all things are possible for the one who believes."
41:9:24:The boy's father cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
41:9:25:Seeing that the crowd was quickly gathering, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again."
41:9:26:The spirit cried out, convulsed the boy violently, and came out. The boy looked so lifeless that many said, "He's dead."
41:9:27:But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he stood up.
41:9:28:When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
41:9:29:He replied, "This kind can only come out through prayer."
41:9:30:Leaving that place, they passed through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know,
41:9:31:for he was teaching his disciples, saying, "The Son of Man will be betrayed into human hands, and they will kill him. But after three days, he will rise."
41:9:32:They didn't understand what he meant but were afraid to ask him about it.
41:9:33:They arrived in Capernaum, and when they were inside the house, Jesus asked them, "What were you arguing about on the way?"
41:9:34:They remained silent, for on the way they had argued about who was the greatest among them.
41:9:35:Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, they must be last of all and servant of all."
41:9:36:He took a child, placed him among them, and embraced him. Then he said,
41:9:37:"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me doesn't welcome just me but also the one who sent me."
41:9:38:John said, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, but he wasn't one of us, so we told him to stop."
41:9:39:Jesus replied, "Don't stop him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me.
41:9:40:Whoever is not against us is for us.
41:9:41:I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.
41:9:42:But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.
41:9:43:If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It's better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
41:9:44:[omitted]
41:9:45:And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It's better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
41:9:46:[omitted]
41:9:47:If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It's better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41:9:48:where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
41:9:49:Everyone will be salted with fire.
41:9:50:Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves and be at peace with each other."
41:10:1:One day, Jesus set out and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River. Crowds gathered around him again, and he continued his practice of teaching them.
41:10:2:Some Pharisees approached Jesus and asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" They wanted to test him.
41:10:3:Jesus replied, "What did Moses command you?"
41:10:4:They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
41:10:5:Jesus told them, "It was because of your hard hearts that Moses wrote this rule for you.
41:10:6:But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.
41:10:7:For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,
41:10:8:and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41:10:9:Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
41:10:10:Later, when they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.
41:10:11:He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
41:10:12:And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
41:10:13:People were bringing little children to Jesus so that he could touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
41:10:14:When Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said, "Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41:10:15:Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
41:10:16:He took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.
41:10:17:As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to him, knelt before him, and asked, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
41:10:18:Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.
41:10:19:You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"
41:10:20:The man replied, "Teacher, I have kept all these since I was a boy."
41:10:21:Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said, "One thing you lack: Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
41:10:22:At this, the man's face fell, and he went away sad because he had great wealth.
41:10:23:Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
41:10:24:The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
41:10:25:It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
41:10:26:The disciples were even more astonished and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"
41:10:27:Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
41:10:28:Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!"
41:10:29:"Truly I tell you," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
41:10:30:will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.
41:10:31:But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
41:10:32:They were on their way up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
41:10:33:"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
41:10:34:who will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him. Three days later, he will rise."
41:10:35:James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
41:10:36:He replied, "What do you want me to do for you?"
41:10:37:They answered, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."
41:10:38:Jesus told them, "You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
41:10:39:"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
41:10:40:but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
41:10:41:When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
41:10:42:Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
41:10:43:Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41:10:44:and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
41:10:45:For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
41:10:46:They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging.
41:10:47:When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41:10:48:Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41:10:49:Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called the blind man, saying, "Take heart, get up; he is calling you."
41:10:50:Bartimaeus threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus.
41:10:51:Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied, "Rabbi, I want to see."
41:10:52:"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
41:11:1:As they approached Jerusalem, near the towns of Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.
41:11:2:He instructed them, "Go to the village you see up ahead; as soon as you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied up. No one has ever ridden it. Untie it and bring it here.
41:11:3:If anyone asks you why you're doing this, just say, 'The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.'"
41:11:4:The disciples went off and found the donkey exactly as Jesus had described.
41:11:5:As they untied it, some bystanders asked, "Why are you untying that donkey?"
41:11:6:The disciples replied as Jesus had told them, and the people let them go.
41:11:7:They brought the donkey to Jesus, put their cloaks on it, and he sat down.
41:11:8:Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others laid branches cut from nearby fields.
41:11:9:Those who led the way and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
41:11:10:Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!"
41:11:11:Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. After looking around at everything, since it was already late, he returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples.
41:11:12:The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus felt hungry.
41:11:13:Seeing a fig tree in the distance covered with leaves, he went to see if it bore any fruit. But when he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, for it wasn't the season for figs.
41:11:14:Jesus said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say this.
41:11:15:They arrived in Jerusalem, and Jesus entered the temple courts. He began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
41:11:16:He wouldn't allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
41:11:17:Jesus taught them, saying, "Isn't it written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have turned it into a den of robbers."
41:11:18:The chief priests and teachers of the law heard this and started looking for a way to kill Jesus, for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
41:11:19:When evening came, Jesus and his disciples left the city.
41:11:20:In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
41:11:21:Peter remembered what had happened and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered."
41:11:22:Jesus replied, "Have faith in God.
41:11:23:Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.
41:11:24:So I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
41:11:25:And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
41:11:26:
41:11:27:They returned to Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders approached him.
41:11:28:"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you the authority to do them?"
41:11:29:Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41:11:30:John's baptism—was it from heaven or of human origin? Tell me!"
41:11:31:They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
41:11:32:But if we say, 'Of human origin'…" They feared the people, for everyone held that John was a prophet.
41:11:33:So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
41:12:1:Jesus started teaching them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it out to some farmers and went on a journey.
41:12:2:At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit from the vineyard.
41:12:3:But they grabbed the servant, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.
41:12:4:So the owner sent another servant to them. This one they hit on the head and treated shamefully.
41:12:5:He sent yet another servant, but they killed him. He sent many others, some they beat, and others they killed.
41:12:6:Finally, he had only one person left to send, his beloved son. He said to himself, 'They will respect my son.'
41:12:7:However, the tenants said to each other, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
41:12:8:So they took the son, killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.
41:12:9:What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
41:12:10:Haven't you read this Scripture: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
41:12:11:this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'"
41:12:12:They tried to arrest Jesus because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away.
41:12:13:Later, they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
41:12:14:They said, "Teacher, we know you are honest and don't favor anyone. You teach the way of God truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
41:12:15:Should we pay them, or shouldn't we?" But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."
41:12:16:They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?" They replied, "Caesar's."
41:12:17:Then Jesus said, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God." And they were amazed at him.
41:12:18:Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
41:12:19:"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
41:12:20:There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
41:12:21:The second one married the widow, but he also died childless. Then the third one married her, and so on through all seven, and they left no children.
41:12:22:Finally, the woman died too.
41:12:23:Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since all seven had married her?"
41:12:24:Jesus replied, "Aren't you mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God?
41:12:25:When people rise from the dead, they won't marry or be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
41:12:26:As for the dead being raised, haven't you read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
41:12:27:He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken."
41:12:28:One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"
41:12:29:Jesus answered, "The most important one is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
41:12:30:Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
41:12:31:The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There
41:12:32:is no commandment greater than these."
41:12:33:The teacher of the law said to him, "Well said, teacher. You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
41:12:34:To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41:12:35:When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
41:12:36:As Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?
41:12:37:David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'
41:12:38:If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41:12:39:In his teaching, Jesus also said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,
41:12:40:and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
41:12:41:They devour widows' houses and, for a show, make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."
41:12:42:Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
41:12:43:But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.
41:12:44:Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
41:12:45:They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on."
41:13:1:As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings and stones!"
41:13:2:Jesus responded, "Do you see all this? I tell you, not one stone will be left on another; everything will be torn down."
41:13:3:Later, as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
41:13:4:"Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign that they're about to take place?"
41:13:5:Jesus began to say, "Be careful that no one deceives you.
41:13:6:Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the one,' and they'll lead many people astray.
41:13:7:When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be alarmed. These things must happen, but it's not the end yet.
41:13:8:Nations will rise against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are just the beginning of birth pains.
41:13:9:Watch out for yourselves. People will hand you over to councils, and you'll be beaten in synagogues. You'll stand before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them.
41:13:10:The good news must first be preached to all nations.
41:13:11:When you're arrested and brought to trial, don't worry beforehand about what to say. Just speak whatever is given to you at that time, for it won't be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41:13:12:Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
41:13:13:Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
41:13:14:When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it shouldn't be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea should flee to the mountains.
41:13:15:If you're on your rooftop, don't go down or enter your house to take anything.
41:13:16:And if you're in the field, don't turn back to get your cloak.
41:13:17:How terrible it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
41:13:18:Pray that this won't happen in winter,
41:13:19:because those days will bring distress unlike any from the beginning of creation until now—and never to be equaled again.
41:13:20:If the Lord hadn't shortened those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
41:13:21:At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look, here's the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' don't believe it.
41:13:22:False messiahs and false prophets will appear, performing signs and wonders to deceive the elect, if possible.
41:13:23:So be on your guard; I've told you everything ahead of time.
41:13:24:But after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon won't give its light,
41:13:25:the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
41:13:26:Then they'll see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
41:13:27:He'll send his angels to gather the elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
41:13:28:Learn this lesson from the fig tree: When its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near.
41:13:29:In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, right at the door.
41:13:30:Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
41:13:31:Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
41:13:32:However, no one knows the day or hour—not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
41:13:33:Be on your guard, stay alert, and pray, for you don't know when the time will come.
41:13:34:It's like a man going away on a journey. He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the doorkeeper to stay alert.
41:13:35:So keep watch, because you don't know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn.
41:13:36:If he comes suddenly, don't let him find you sleeping.
41:13:37:What I say to you, I say to everyone: Stay awake!"
41:14:1:It was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
41:14:2:"We shouldn't do it during the festival," they said, "or there might be a riot among the people."
41:14:3:While Jesus was in Bethany at Simon the leper's house, reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
41:14:4:Some of those present were indignant. "Why waste this perfume?" they asked.
41:14:5:"It could have been sold for over a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they scolded her harshly.
41:14:6:But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
41:14:7:You will always have the poor with you, and you can help them whenever you want, but you won't always have me.
41:14:8:She did what she could; she anointed my body beforehand for burial.
41:14:9:Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
41:14:10:Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
41:14:11:They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he began looking for an opportunity to hand Jesus over.
41:14:12:On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
41:14:13:He sent two of his disciples, instructing them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
41:14:14:When he enters a house, say to the owner, 'The Teacher asks, "Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
41:14:15:He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
41:14:16:The disciples left, went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal.
41:14:17:In the evening, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
41:14:18:While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me."
41:14:19:They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"
41:14:20:"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
41:14:21:The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
41:14:22:While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
41:14:23:Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.
41:14:24:"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.
41:14:25:"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41:14:26:After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41:14:27:Jesus told them, "You will all fall away, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
41:14:28:But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
41:14:29:Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
41:14:30:"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny me three times."
41:14:31:But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you." And all the others said the same.
41:14:32:They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
41:14:33:He took Peter, James, and John along with him and began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
41:14:34:"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."
41:14:35:Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him.
41:14:36:"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
41:14:37:Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour?
41:14:38:Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41:14:39:Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
41:14:40:When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
41:14:41:Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
41:14:42:Get up! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
41:14:43:Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
41:14:44:Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
41:14:45:Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
41:14:46:The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
41:14:47:Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
41:14:48:"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
41:14:49:Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
41:14:50:Then everyone deserted him and fled.
41:14:51:A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,
41:14:52:he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
41:14:53:They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law came together.
41:14:54:Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
41:14:55:The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
41:14:56:Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
41:14:57:Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
41:14:58:"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made by human hands.'"
41:14:59:Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
41:14:60:The high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
41:14:61:But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41:14:62:"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
41:14:63:The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.
41:14:64:"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.
41:14:65:Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.
41:14:66:While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
41:14:67:When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.
41:14:68:But he denied it, saying, "I don't know or understand what you're talking about." He went out into the entryway, and a rooster crowed.
41:14:69:When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."
41:14:70:Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
41:14:71:He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."
41:14:72:Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.
41:15:1:Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole council held a meeting. They tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
41:15:2:Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You've said it."
41:15:3:The chief priests accused Jesus of many things.
41:15:4:So Pilate questioned Jesus again, asking, "Aren't you going to respond? Look at all these accusations against you!" 
41:15:5:But Jesus remained silent and didn't answer anything, which surprised Pilate.
41:15:6:During the festival, Pilate would release one prisoner chosen by the people.
41:15:7:There was a man named Barabbas who had been imprisoned with rebels for committing murder during an uprising.
41:15:8:The crowd approached Pilate, asking him to do what he usually did.
41:15:9:Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?"
41:15:10:He knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over because they were envious.
41:15:11:However, the chief priests stirred up the crowd to demand that Pilate release Barabbas instead.
41:15:12:Then Pilate asked them, "What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?"
41:15:13:They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
41:15:14:Pilate responded, "Why? What has he done wrong?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
41:15:15:Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. He had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.
41:15:16:The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor's palace and called together the whole company of soldiers.
41:15:17:They dressed Jesus in a purple robe and twisted together a crown of thorns, placing it on his head.
41:15:18:They began to salute him, mockingly saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
41:15:19:They struck his head with a staff, spit on him, and knelt down in fake homage.
41:15:20:When they finished mocking him, they removed the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to be crucified.
41:15:21:A man named Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the countryside, was forced to carry Jesus' cross. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus.
41:15:22:They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means "Place of the Skull."
41:15:23:There, they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he didn't take it.
41:15:24:They crucified him, dividing his clothes among themselves by casting lots to see who would get what.
41:15:25:It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
41:15:26:The written notice of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."
41:15:27:Two rebels were also crucified with Jesus, one on his right and one on his left.
41:15:28:This fulfilled the Scripture that says, "He was counted among the lawless."
41:15:29:People passing by hurled insults at Jesus, shaking their heads and saying, "Ha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
41:15:30:save yourself and come down from the cross!"
41:15:31:The chief priests and scribes also mocked him, saying to each other, "He saved others, but he can't save himself!
41:15:32:Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe." Even those who were crucified with Jesus insulted him.
41:15:33:At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
41:15:34:At three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
41:15:35:Some of those standing nearby heard this and said, "Listen, he's calling for Elijah."
41:15:36:One person ran, filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. They said, "Wait, let's see if Elijah comes to take
41:15:37:Jesus down from the cross." With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
41:15:38:The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
41:15:39:When the centurion standing there saw how Jesus died, he said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"
41:15:40:Some women were watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41:15:41:These women had followed and cared for Jesus when he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
41:15:42:It was Preparation Day, the day before the Sabbath. As evening approached,
41:15:43:Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
41:15:44:Pilate was surprised that Jesus was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked if Jesus had been dead for some time.
41:15:45:When he learned from the centurion that Jesus was indeed dead, he granted Joseph permission to take the body.
41:15:46:Joseph bought linen cloth, took Jesus down from the cross, wrapped him in the linen, and placed him in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
41:15:47:Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where Jesus was laid.
41:16:1:After the Sabbath was over, as Sunday began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
41:16:2:Unexpectedly, there was a powerful earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolling away the stone that sealed the tomb and sitting on it.
41:16:3:His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.
41:16:4:The guards trembled in fear and became like dead men.
41:16:5:But the angel said to the women, "Don't be afraid; I know you're looking for Jesus who was crucified.
41:16:6:He isn't here, for he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
41:16:7:Now go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he's going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him. Remember what I've told you."
41:16:8:So they left the tomb quickly, filled with both fear and great joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
41:16:9:As they were on their way, Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him.
41:16:10:Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there."
41:16:11:While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
41:16:12:After meeting with the elders and devising a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
41:16:13:Instructing them to say, "His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep."
41:16:14:They assured them, "If this comes to the governor's ears, we'll smooth things over with him and keep you out of trouble."
41:16:15:So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
41:16:16:Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
41:16:17:When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some still doubted.
41:16:18:Jesus approached them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
41:16:19:Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
41:16:20:Teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
