42:1:1:Many have undertaken to compile an account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,
42:1:2:just as they were handed down to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
42:1:3:So, I too have decided, after carefully investigating everything from the beginning, to write a well-ordered account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
42:1:4:so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
42:1:5:In the time of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, named Elizabeth.
42:1:6:Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the Lord's commandments and regulations.
42:1:7:But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.
42:1:8:One day, while Zechariah was performing his priestly duties before God, as his division was on duty,
42:1:9:he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
42:1:10:And the whole assembly of the people was praying outside at the time of the incense offering.
42:1:11:Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
42:1:12:Zechariah was startled and filled with fear upon seeing the angel.
42:1:13:But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John.
42:1:14:You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,
42:1:15:for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.
42:1:16:He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,
42:1:17:and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42:1:18:Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years."
42:1:19:The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and bring you this good news.
42:1:20:Now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will become mute, unable to speak until the day these things occur."
42:1:21:Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, wondering why he was taking so long in the temple.
42:1:22:When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
42:1:23:When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
42:1:24:After this, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion, saying,
42:1:25:"The Lord has done this for me; in these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."
42:1:26:In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
42:1:27:to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
42:1:28:The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."
42:1:29:Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
42:1:30:But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.
42:1:31:You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall name him Jesus.
42:1:32:He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
42:1:33:and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."
42:1:34:Mary asked the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
42:1:35:The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
42:1:36:And now, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.
42:1:37:For nothing is impossible with God."
42:1:38:Mary replied, "I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me according to your word." Then the angel left her.
42:1:39:Soon after, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
42:1:40:where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
42:1:41:When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42:1:42:In a loud voice she exclaimed, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
42:1:43:But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42:1:44:As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
42:1:45:Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"
42:1:46:Mary said, "My soul glorifies the Lord,
42:1:47:and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
42:1:48:for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42:1:49:for the Mighty One has done great things for me—holy is his name.
42:1:50:His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42:1:51:He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42:1:52:He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42:1:53:He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42:1:54:He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42:1:55:to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."
42:1:56:Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
42:1:57:When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a son.
42:1:58:Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
42:1:59:On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,
42:1:60:but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."
42:1:61:They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
42:1:62:Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
42:1:63:He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."
42:1:64:Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.
42:1:65:All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
42:1:66:Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.
42:1:67:His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
42:1:68:"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
42:1:69:He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42:1:70:(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42:1:71:salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—
42:1:72:to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
42:1:73:the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
42:1:74:to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42:1:75:in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42:1:76:And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42:1:77:to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42:1:78:because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42:1:79:to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."
42:1:80:And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.
42:2:1:During those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that everyone in the Roman Empire should be registered.
42:2:2:This census was the first to take place while Quirinius governed Syria.
42:2:3:So, everybody went to their hometowns to be registered.
42:2:4:Joseph also traveled from Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he belonged to the house and family line of David.
42:2:5:He went there with Mary, his fiancée, who was pregnant.
42:2:6:While they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to give birth.
42:2:7:She delivered her firstborn son, wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them at the inn.
42:2:8:In the nearby fields, shepherds were watching over their flocks at night.
42:2:9:An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, making them very afraid.
42:2:10:But the angel reassured them, saying, "Don't be afraid! I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.
42:2:11:Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord.
42:2:12:You'll recognize him by this sign: You'll find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."
42:2:13:Suddenly, a multitude of heavenly beings joined the angel, praising God and saying,
42:2:14:"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!"
42:2:15:When the angels left and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this event that the Lord has made known to us."
42:2:16:They hurried off and found Mary, Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
42:2:17:After seeing them, they shared what the angel had told them about the child.
42:2:18:Everyone who heard their story was amazed at what the shepherds said.
42:2:19:Mary treasured these things and pondered them in her heart.
42:2:20:The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had seen and heard, just as it had been told to them.
42:2:21:Eight days later, when it was time to circumcise the baby, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived.
42:2:22:When the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
42:2:23:As it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord."
42:2:24:They also offered a sacrifice in keeping with the law: "a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."
42:2:25:In Jerusalem, there was a man named Simeon who was righteous and devout. He eagerly awaited the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
42:2:26:The Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Lord's Messiah.
42:2:27:Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the baby Jesus to fulfill the customary rituals,
42:2:28:Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
42:2:29:"Sovereign Lord, as you promised, now I can die in peace.
42:2:30:For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42:2:31:which you prepared for all people to see,
42:2:32:a light to reveal you to the nations and the glory of your people Israel."
42:2:33:Jesus' parents were amazed at what Simeon said about him.
42:2:34:Simeon blessed them and told Mary, his mother, "This child is destined to cause the rise and fall of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
42:2:35:so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
42:2:36:There was also a prophetess named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
42:2:37:and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple, worshiping night and day with fasting and prayer.
42:2:38:At that very moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
42:2:39:When Joseph and Mary had completed everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
42:2:40:The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
42:2:41:Every year, Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.
42:2:42:When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival according to the custom.
42:2:43:After the celebration was over, they started back home, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it.
42:2:44:Assuming he was with their group, they traveled for a day before searching for him among their relatives and friends.
42:2:45:When they didn't find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
42:2:46:After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions.
42:2:47:Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
42:2:48:When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."
42:2:49:He replied, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"
42:2:50:But they didn't understand what he was saying to them.
42:2:51:Then he went down with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.
42:2:52:And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and people.
42:3:1:In the fifteenth year of Emperor Tiberius' reign, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod was the ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip ruled Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias governed Abilene,
42:3:2:the word of God came to John, son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.
42:3:3:He traveled throughout the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
42:3:4:As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "A voice crying out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight.
42:3:5:Every valley shall be filled, every mountain and hill made low; the crooked roads will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.
42:3:6:And all people will see God's salvation.'"
42:3:7:John would say to the crowds coming to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
42:3:8:Produce fruit that shows you have repented. Don't start saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' because I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
42:3:9:The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
42:3:10:The people asked him, "What should we do then?"
42:3:11:John replied, "If you have two shirts, share with someone who has none. If you have food, do the same."
42:3:12:Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?"
42:3:13:He told them, "Collect no more than you are authorized to."
42:3:14:Soldiers questioned him as well, "What about us? What should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money, don't accuse people falsely, and be content with your pay."
42:3:15:The people were filled with expectation, wondering in their hearts if John might be the Messiah.
42:3:16:John answered them all, "I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I is coming, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42:3:17:His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."
42:3:18:With many other exhortations, John preached the good news to the people.
42:3:19:But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch for his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things he had done,
42:3:20:Herod added this to everything else—he locked John up in prison.
42:3:21:When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also baptized. As he was praying, heaven opened,
42:3:22:and the Holy Spirit descended on him in a physical form like a dove. A voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
42:3:23:Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was thought to be the son of Joseph, son of Heli,
42:3:24:son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melki, son of Jannai, son of Joseph,
42:3:25:son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,
42:3:26:son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josek, son of Joda,
42:3:27:son of Joanan, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,
42:3:28:son of Melki, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er,
42:3:29:son of Joshua, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi,
42:3:30:son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim,
42:3:31:son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,
42:3:32:son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,
42:3:33:son of Amminadab, son of Ram, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah,
42:3:34:son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,
42:3:35:son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,
42:3:36:son of Cainan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,
42:3:37:son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan,
42:3:38:son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, who was the son of God.
42:4:1:Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
42:4:2:For forty days, he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were over, he was famished.
42:4:3:The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
42:4:4:Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
42:4:5:Then the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.
42:4:6:And the devil said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
42:4:7:If you worship me, it will all be yours."
42:4:8:Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"
42:4:9:Next, the devil took him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.
42:4:10:For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;
42:4:11:they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
42:4:12:Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
42:4:13:When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until an opportune time.
42:4:14:Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
42:4:15:He taught in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.
42:4:16:He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
42:4:17:and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:
42:4:18:"The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,
42:4:19:to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
42:4:20:Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.
42:4:21:He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
42:4:22:All spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.
42:4:23:Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"
42:4:24:"Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
42:4:25:I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
42:4:26:Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.
42:4:27:And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian."
42:4:28:All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
42:4:29:They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, intending to throw him off the cliff.
42:4:30:But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
42:4:31:Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and began teaching the people on the Sabbath.
42:4:32:They were amazed at his teaching because his words had authority.
42:4:33:In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,
42:4:34:"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
42:4:35:Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet! Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
42:4:36:All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he commands the impure spirits, and they come out!"
42:4:37:And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
42:4:38:Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
42:4:39:So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.
42:4:40:At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
42:4:41:Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew he was the Messiah.
42:4:42:At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
42:4:43:But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."
42:4:44:And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
42:5:1:One day, as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, people were pressing around him to hear the word of God.
42:5:2:He saw two boats at the water's edge. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
42:5:3:Getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, he asked him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
42:5:4:When he finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Head out into deeper water and let down your nets for a catch."
42:5:5:Simon replied, "Master, we've worked hard all night and caught nothing. But because you say so, I'll let down the nets."
42:5:6:When they did this, they caught a huge number of fish, so many that their nets began to tear.
42:5:7:They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
42:5:8:Seeing this, Simon Peter fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!"
42:5:9:He and everyone with him were amazed at the catch of fish they had taken,
42:5:10:as were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on, you will catch people instead of fish."
42:5:11:So they pulled their boats up on the shore, left everything, and followed him.
42:5:12:In another instance, Jesus was in a town when he encountered a man covered with leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed down and begged him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
42:5:13:Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately, the leprosy left him.
42:5:14:Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone, but to go and show himself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
42:5:15:However, news about him spread even more, and large crowds gathered to hear him and be healed of their sicknesses.
42:5:16:But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
42:5:17:On another occasion, some men brought a paralyzed man on a mat, trying to get him in front of Jesus.
42:5:18:Because they couldn't find a way through the crowd, they went up onto the roof and lowered the man on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus.
42:5:19:Seeing their faith, Jesus said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
42:5:20:The Pharisees and teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
42:5:21:Knowing their thoughts, Jesus asked them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
42:5:22:Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
42:5:23:But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go home."
42:5:24:Immediately, the man stood up in front of them, took his mat, and went home praising God.
42:5:25:Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."
42:5:26:Later on, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,
42:5:27:and Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
42:5:28:Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and many tax collectors and others were eating with them.
42:5:29:But the Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples, asking, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42:5:30:Jesus answered them, "It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
42:5:31:I haven't come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42:5:32:They asked him, "John's disciples often
42:5:33:fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."
42:5:34:Jesus replied, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?
42:5:35:But a time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast."
42:5:36:He also told them this parable: "No one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If they do, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new won't match the old.
42:5:37:And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined.
42:5:38:Instead, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
42:5:39:And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'"
42:6:1:One Sabbath day, as Jesus was walking through some grain fields, his disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands and eating the kernels.
42:6:2:Some Pharisees saw this and asked, "Why are your disciples doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
42:6:3:Jesus replied, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
42:6:4:He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave it to his companions."
42:6:5:Then Jesus said, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42:6:6:On another Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and taught. A man with a paralyzed right hand was there.
42:6:7:The religious leaders and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they could find a reason to accuse him.
42:6:8:But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stand up and come forward." The man got up and stood there.
42:6:9:Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?"
42:6:10:After looking around at them all, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." The man did so, and his hand was completely restored.
42:6:11:But the religious leaders and the Pharisees were furious and began discussing what they might do to Jesus.
42:6:12:During that time, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and spent the whole night in prayer to God.
42:6:13:When daylight came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated as apostles:
42:6:14:Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42:6:15:Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,
42:6:16:Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42:6:17:Jesus and the apostles came down from the mountain and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples and many people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon
42:6:18:had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were also cured.
42:6:19:The whole crowd tried to touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all.
42:6:20:Then Jesus looked at his disciples and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
42:6:21:Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
42:6:22:Blessed are you when people hate you, exclude you, insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
42:6:23:Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For their ancestors treated the prophets the same way.
42:6:24:But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
42:6:25:Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
42:6:26:Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.
42:6:27:But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42:6:28:bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42:6:29:If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt as well.
42:6:30:Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.
42:6:31:Do to others as you would have them do to you.
42:6:32:If you love only those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
42:6:33:And if you do good only to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.
42:6:34:And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
42:6:35:But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
42:6:36:Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
42:6:37:Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42:6:38:Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."
42:6:39:Jesus also told them a parable: "Can a blind man lead another blind man? Won't they both fall into a pit?
42:6:40:A student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.
42:6:41:Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye but pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
42:6:42:How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
42:6:43:For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit, nor a bad tree that produces good fruit.
42:6:44:Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
42:6:45:A good person brings good things out of the good stored in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
42:6:46:Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
42:6:47:Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.
42:6:48:But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed, and its destruction was complete."
42:7:1:When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people, he entered Capernaum.
42:7:2:A centurion's servant, whom he valued highly, was sick and about to die.
42:7:3:Hearing about Jesus, the centurion sent some Jewish elders to him, asking if he would come and heal his servant.
42:7:4:When they approached Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, saying, "This man deserves your help,
42:7:5:because he loves our nation and has even built us a synagogue."
42:7:6:So Jesus went with them. As he neared the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
42:7:7:That's why I didn't consider myself worthy to come to you. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
42:7:8:For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one, 'Go,' and he goes; another, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
42:7:9:Hearing this, Jesus was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."
42:7:10:When the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant well.
42:7:11:Soon after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd followed him.
42:7:12:As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, who was a widow. A sizable crowd from the town was with her.
42:7:13:When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her and said, "Don't cry."
42:7:14:Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, get up!"
42:7:15:The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
42:7:16:Everyone was filled with awe and praised God, saying, "A great prophet has appeared among us," and "God has come to help his people."
42:7:17:This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region.
42:7:18:John's disciples informed him about all these things. Calling two of them,
42:7:19:he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"
42:7:20:When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to ask you, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'"
42:7:21:At that very time, Jesus healed many people of diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
42:7:22:So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
42:7:23:Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."
42:7:24:After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
42:7:25:If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
42:7:26:But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
42:7:27:This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
42:7:28:I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42:7:29:All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right because they had been baptized by John.
42:7:30:But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.
42:7:31:Jesus went on to say, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
42:7:32:They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other, 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'
42:7:33:For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
42:7:34:The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'
42:7:35:But wisdom is proved right by all her children."
42:7:36:One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
42:7:37:A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
42:7:38:As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.
42:7:39:When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner."
42:7:40:Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.
42:7:41:"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42:7:42:Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"
42:7:43:Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
42:7:44:Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
42:7:45:You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.
42:7:46:You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
42:7:47:Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."
42:7:48:Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
42:7:49:The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
42:7:50:Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
42:8:1:After this, Jesus traveled from one town to another, spreading the good news of God's kingdom. The twelve disciples were with him,
42:8:2:along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses. These included Mary, called Magdalene, who had seven demons cast out of her,
42:8:3:Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others who supported them with their resources.
42:8:4:A large crowd gathered as people came to him from various towns. He told them a parable:
42:8:5:"A farmer went out to sow his seeds. As he was scattering them, some fell along the path and were trampled on, while birds ate them up.
42:8:6:Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where they began to grow but soon withered due to lack of moisture.
42:8:7:Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up with them and choked the plants.
42:8:8:Still, other seeds fell on good soil, where they grew and produced a crop—a hundred times more than what was sown." After saying this, he added, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
42:8:9:His disciples asked him about the meaning of the parable.
42:8:10:He replied, "You have been given the privilege to understand the mysteries of God's kingdom, but others receive them in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
42:8:11:Here is the meaning of the parable: The seed represents the word of God.
42:8:12:Those along the path are those who hear, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so they cannot believe and be saved.
42:8:13:Those on rocky ground are the ones who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in times of testing, they fall away.
42:8:14:The seeds that fell among thorns represent those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature.
42:8:15:But the seeds on good soil stand for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.
42:8:16:"No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.
42:8:17:For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.
42:8:18:So be careful how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what they think they possess will be taken away."
42:8:19:Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd.
42:8:20:Someone informed him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."
42:8:21:He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."
42:8:22:One day, Jesus and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, "Let's cross over to the other side of the lake." So they set out.
42:8:23:As they sailed, Jesus fell asleep. A storm came down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, putting them in danger.
42:8:24:The disciples woke him up, saying, "Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.
42:8:25:He asked them, "Where is your faith?" In fear and amazement, they said to one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."
42:8:26:They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
42:8:27:As Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a man from the town who was possessed by demons. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house but had lived among the tombs.
42:8:28:When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"
42:8:29:For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he broke his chains and was driven by the demon into solitary places.
42:8:30:Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
42:8:31:And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
42:8:32:A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.
42:8:33:When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
42:8:34:Those tending the pigs saw what had happened, and they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.
42:8:35:People went out to see what had occurred, and they came to Jesus. They found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
42:8:36:Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.
42:8:37:Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
42:8:38:The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
42:8:39:"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
42:8:40:When Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
42:8:41:Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house
42:8:42:because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
42:8:43:And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years but could not be healed by anyone.
42:8:44:She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
42:8:45:"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."
42:8:46:But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."
42:8:47:Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
42:8:48:He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."
42:8:49:While he was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore."
42:8:50:Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
42:8:51:When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.
42:8:52:Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."
42:8:53:They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
42:8:54:But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"
42:8:55:Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
42:8:56:Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
42:9:1:One day, Jesus called together his twelve disciples and gave them power and authority to cast out demons and heal diseases.
42:9:2:He then sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42:9:3:"Take nothing for your journey," he instructed them. "No staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and don't even take extra clothes.
42:9:4:When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
42:9:5:If people don't welcome you, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them when you leave."
42:9:6:So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the Good News and healing people everywhere.
42:9:7:Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
42:9:8:Others thought Elijah had appeared, and still others believed one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.
42:9:9:But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see Jesus.
42:9:10:When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.
42:9:11:The crowds found out about it and followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the Kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
42:9:12:As the day wore on, the twelve approached Jesus and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."
42:9:13:He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people."
42:9:14:There were about five thousand men present. Jesus said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
42:9:15:The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.
42:9:16:Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.
42:9:17:They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
42:9:18:Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
42:9:19:They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."
42:9:20:"But what about you?" he asked them. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah."
42:9:21:Jesus warned them not to tell this to anyone.
42:9:22:He said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He will be killed, but on the third day, he will rise again."
42:9:23:Then he said to them all, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross daily, and follow me.
42:9:24:For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will save it.
42:9:25:What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit their very self?
42:9:26:Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
42:9:27:Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Kingdom of God."
42:9:28:About eight days after saying this, Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
42:9:29:As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
42:9:30:Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.
42:9:31:They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
42:9:32:Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him.
42:9:33:As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it's good for us to be here. Let's put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He didn't know what he was saying.
42:9:34:While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and the disciples were afraid as they entered the cloud.
42:9:35:A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."
42:9:36:When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
42:9:37:The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
42:9:38:A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
42:9:39:A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
42:9:40:I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."
42:9:41:"You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
42:9:42:Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
42:9:43:And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
42:9:44:"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
42:9:45:But they did not understand this statement. It was hidden from them so that they could not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
42:9:46:An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
42:9:47:Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
42:9:48:Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest."
42:9:49:"Master," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he is not one of us."
42:9:50:"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."
42:9:51:As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
42:9:52:He sent messengers ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
42:9:53:But the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
42:9:54:When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"
42:9:55:But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
42:9:56:Then he and his disciples went to another village.
42:9:57:As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
42:9:58:Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
42:9:59:He said to another man, "Follow me." But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
42:9:60:Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
42:9:61:Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family."
42:9:62:Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."
42:10:1:After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out in pairs ahead of Him to every town and place where He was about to go.
42:10:2:He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. So, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send more workers into His fields.
42:10:3:Now go on your way! Remember, I'm sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42:10:4:Don't carry a purse, bag, or sandals; and don't greet anyone on the road.
42:10:5:When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace be with this home.'
42:10:6:If someone who promotes peace lives there, your blessing will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.
42:10:7:Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the worker deserves his wages. Don't move around from house to house.
42:10:8:When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what's offered to you.
42:10:9:Heal the sick who are there, and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
42:10:10:But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and declare,
42:10:11:'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a protest against you. But know this: The kingdom of God has come near.'
42:10:12:I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
42:10:13:Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42:10:14:But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
42:10:15:And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.
42:10:16:Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me."
42:10:17:The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!"
42:10:18:He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
42:10:19:Look, I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.
42:10:20:However, don't rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
42:10:21:At that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you've hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
42:10:22:All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
42:10:23:Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
42:10:24:For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."
42:10:25:On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42:10:26:"What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you read it?"
42:10:27:He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
42:10:28:"You've answered correctly," Jesus said. "Do this, and you will live."
42:10:29:But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42:10:30:In reply, Jesus said, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and left him half dead.
42:10:31:A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
42:10:32:So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42:10:33:But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
42:10:34:He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
42:10:35:The next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'
42:10:36:Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"
42:10:37:The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."
42:10:38:As they continued on their journey, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
42:10:39:She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
42:10:40:But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"
42:10:41:"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,
42:10:42:but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."
42:11:1:One day, Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples asked him, "Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
42:11:2:He replied, "When you pray, say: 'Father, may your name be honored; let your kingdom come.
42:11:3:Give us each day the food we need,
42:11:4:and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who has wronged us. And don't let us fall into temptation.'"
42:11:5:Then Jesus told them a story: "Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight, saying, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
42:11:6:because a friend of mine has arrived unexpectedly, and I have nothing to offer him.'
42:11:7:The friend inside might answer, 'Don't bother me! The door is locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up to give you anything.'
42:11:8:I tell you, even if he won't get up because of friendship, he will surely get up and give whatever is needed because of the persistence of the one asking.
42:11:9:So, I say to you: ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
42:11:10:For everyone who asks receives; those who seek find; and to those who knock, the door will be opened.
42:11:11:Which of you fathers, if your child asks for a fish, would give him a snake instead?
42:11:12:Or if they ask for an egg, would give them a scorpion?
42:11:13:If you, being imperfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"
42:11:14:Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.
42:11:15:But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of demons."
42:11:16:Others tested him by demanding a sign from heaven.
42:11:17:Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls.
42:11:18:If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? You claim that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
42:11:19:And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
42:11:20:But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
42:11:21:When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are safe.
42:11:22:But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.
42:11:23:Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
42:11:24:When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it travels through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'
42:11:25:On returning, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
42:11:26:Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first."
42:11:27:As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you!"
42:11:28:He replied, "Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it."
42:11:29:As the crowd grew, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
42:11:30:For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
42:11:31:The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.
42:11:32:The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.
42:11:33:No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
42:11:34:Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body is full of darkness.
42:11:35:Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
42:11:36:If your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be completely illuminated, as when a lamp shines its light on you."
42:11:37:When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.
42:11:38:But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.
42:11:39:Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
42:11:40:You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
42:11:41:But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.
42:11:42:Woe to you Pharisees, for you give God a tenth of your mint, rue, and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
42:11:43:Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
42:11:44:Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it."
42:11:45:One of the experts in the law said to him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us too."
42:11:46:Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.
42:11:47:Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.
42:11:48:So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
42:11:49:Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'
42:11:50:Therefore, this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,
42:11:51:from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.
42:11:52:Woe to you experts in the law, for you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."
42:11:53:When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to bombard him with questions,
42:11:54:waiting to catch him in something he might say.
42:12:1:At that time, Jesus began teaching his followers in the presence of thousands. He said, "Beware of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, which is like yeast that spreads through dough.
42:12:2:"There's nothing concealed that won't be revealed, and nothing hidden that won't be made known.
42:12:3:"Whatever you've said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you've whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the rooftops.
42:12:4:"I tell you, my friends, don't fear those who can kill the body but can't do anything else after that.
42:12:5:"Instead, I'll show you whom to fear: Fear the One who, after killing, has the power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him!
42:12:6:"Aren't five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
42:12:7:"Even the hairs on your head are all numbered. So, don't be afraid; you're worth more than many sparrows.
42:12:8:"I assure you, whoever acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.
42:12:9:"But anyone who denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God.
42:12:10:"Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42:12:11:"When they bring you before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, don't worry about how to defend yourself or what to say,
42:12:12:"for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you should say."
42:12:13:Someone from the crowd said, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
42:12:14:Jesus replied, "Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?"
42:12:15:He continued, "Watch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed, for life is not measured by how much you own."
42:12:16:Then he told them a parable: "A rich man's land produced a great harvest.
42:12:17:"He thought to himself, 'What should I do? I don't have enough space to store my crops.'
42:12:18:"Then he said, 'I know what I'll do! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, where I can store all my grain and goods.
42:12:19:"And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."'
42:12:20:"But God said to him, 'You fool! Tonight your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get all the things you've prepared?'
42:12:21:"That's how it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God."
42:12:22:Jesus then said to his disciples, "So I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.
42:12:23:"Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
42:12:24:"Consider the ravens: they don't sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
42:12:25:"Who among you, by worrying, can add a single hour to your life?
42:12:26:"If you can't do such a small thing, why worry about the rest?
42:12:27:"Think about the lilies and how they grow. They don't work or make clothing, yet Solomon in all his splendor wasn't dressed as beautifully as one of these.
42:12:28:"If God clothes the grass like this, which is here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!
42:12:29:"Don't be anxious about what you'll eat or drink; don't worry about it.
42:12:30:"For all the nations of the world seek after these things, but your Father knows that you need them.
42:12:31:"Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be provided for you as well.
42:12:32:"Don't be afraid, little flock, for it's your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
42:12:33:"Sell your possessions and give to those in need. Make for yourselves purses that won't
42:12:34:"Be dressed for action and have your lamps burning.
42:12:35:"Be like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, ready to open the door as soon as he arrives and knocks.
42:12:36:"Blessed are those servants whom the master finds alert when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, have them recline at the table, and will come and serve them.
42:12:37:"If he comes in the middle of the night or just before dawn and finds them ready, those servants are blessed.
42:12:38:"But know this: if the homeowner knew at what hour the thief was coming, he wouldn't let his house be broken into.
42:12:39:"You also must be prepared, for the Son of Man will come at an hour you don't expect."
42:12:40:Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable just for us, or for everyone?"
42:12:41:The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?
42:12:42:"Blessed is that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
42:12:43:"Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42:12:44:"But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is taking a long time to return,' and starts to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
42:12:45:"the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour he doesn't know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42:12:46:"The servant who knew his master's will but didn't prepare or act according to it will be beaten with many blows.
42:12:47:"But the one who didn't know and did things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
42:12:48:"I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
42:12:49:"But I have a baptism to undergo, and what stress I am under until it is completed!
42:12:50:"Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
42:12:51:"From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.
42:12:52:"Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
42:12:53:Jesus also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.
42:12:54:"And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.
42:12:55:"You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. Why don't you know how to interpret this present time?
42:12:56:"Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
42:12:57:"As you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, or he may drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
42:12:58:"I tell you, you won't get out until you've paid the very last penny."
42:13:1:At that time, some people came and told Jesus about the Galileans who had been killed by Pilate while offering sacrifices.
42:13:2:Jesus responded, "Do you think these Galileans were more sinful than all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?
42:13:3:I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
42:13:4:Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?
42:13:5:I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
42:13:6:Then Jesus told this parable: "A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but found none.
42:13:7:So he said to the gardener, 'For three years now I've come looking for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'
42:13:8:The gardener replied, 'Sir, let it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.
42:13:9:If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"
42:13:10:As Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,
42:13:11:a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and couldn't straighten up at all.
42:13:12:When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."
42:13:13:Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
42:13:14:Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."
42:13:15:The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
42:13:16:Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"
42:13:17:When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
42:13:18:Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?
42:13:19:It's like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches."
42:13:20:Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
42:13:21:It's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."
42:13:22:Jesus traveled through towns and villages, teaching as he went, making his way toward Jerusalem.
42:13:23:Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He replied,
42:13:24:"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
42:13:25:Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'
42:13:26:Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'
42:13:27:But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'
42:13:28:There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.
42:13:29:People will come from east and west, north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
42:13:30:Indeed, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last."
42:13:31:At that time, some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."
42:13:32:Jesus replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'
42:13:33:In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
42:13:34:"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
42:13:35:Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
42:14:1:One day, when Jesus went to eat at the house of a leading Pharisee, everyone was watching him closely.
42:14:2:A man suffering from swollen limbs was there,
42:14:3:and Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"
42:14:4:They remained silent. So Jesus healed the man and sent him away.
42:14:5:Then he asked them, "If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you immediately pull them out?"
42:14:6:They couldn't answer his question.
42:14:7:Jesus noticed how the guests were choosing the best seats, so he told them this parable:
42:14:8:"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, don't sit in the place of honor, because someone more distinguished than you may have been invited.
42:14:9:If so, the host will come and say to you, 'Give this person your seat,' and you'll be humiliated as you move to a lower place.
42:14:10:Instead, when you're invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he'll say, 'Friend, move up to a better seat.' Then you'll be honored in front of all the other guests.
42:14:11:For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42:14:12:Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a lunch or dinner, don't invite your friends, relatives, or wealthy neighbors; they might repay you by inviting you back.
42:14:13:Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
42:14:14:You'll be blessed, for they can't repay you, and you'll be rewarded at the resurrection of the righteous."
42:14:15:When one of the guests heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."
42:14:16:Jesus replied with a parable: "A man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests.
42:14:17:At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, everything is ready.'
42:14:18:But they all began making excuses. The first said, 'I just bought a field and must go see it. Please excuse me.'
42:14:19:Another said, 'I've purchased five pairs of oxen and need to test them out. Please excuse me.'
42:14:20:A third said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'
42:14:21:The servant returned and reported their responses to his master. The owner of the house became angry and told his servant, 'Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
42:14:22:After the servant had done this, he reported, 'There's still room for more.'
42:14:23:So the master told him, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel people to come in so that my house will be full.
42:14:24:For I tell you, not one of those who were invited will taste my banquet.'"
42:14:25:Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned and said to them,
42:14:26:"If anyone comes to me and doesn't hate their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even their own life, they cannot be my disciple.
42:14:27:Whoever doesn't carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
42:14:28:If you want to build a tower, wouldn't you first sit down and calculate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?
42:14:29:Otherwise, if you lay the foundation but can't finish the work, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,
42:14:30:saying, 'This person started building but couldn't finish.'
42:14:31:Or what king, going to war against another king, wouldn't first sit down and consider whether he's able to face an enemy with ten thousand soldiers when he has only five thousand?
42:14:32:If not, while the other king is still far away, he'll send a delegation to ask for terms of peace.
42:14:33:In the same way, none of you can be my disciple unless you give up everything you have.
42:14:34:"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
42:14:35:It's not useful for the soil or the manure pile; it's thrown away. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
42:15:1:One day, a crowd of tax collectors and sinners gathered around Jesus to hear him teach.
42:15:2:The Pharisees and religious teachers grumbled among themselves, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and even eats with them."
42:15:3:So Jesus told them a parable:
42:15:4:"Imagine a shepherd who has a hundred sheep. If he loses one, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open field and search for the lost sheep until he finds it?
42:15:5:And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
42:15:6:and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Celebrate with me! I've found my lost sheep!'
42:15:7:I tell you, there's more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don't need to repent.
42:15:8:"Or think about a woman who has ten silver coins. If she loses one, doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
42:15:9:When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me! I've found my lost coin!'
42:15:10:In the same way, I tell you, there's joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents."
42:15:11:Jesus continued, "A man had two sons.
42:15:12:The younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the inheritance.' So the father divided his property between them.
42:15:13:Not long after, the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country where he squandered his wealth in wild living.
42:15:14:After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he began to be in need.
42:15:15:So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
42:15:16:He longed to fill his stomach with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
42:15:17:"Finally, he came to his senses and said, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food, while I'm here starving to death!
42:15:18:I'll get up, go to my father, and say to him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.
42:15:19:I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me like one of your hired workers."'
42:15:20:So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him.
42:15:21:The son said, 'Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.'
42:15:22:But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42:15:23:Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's celebrate with a feast,
42:15:24:for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and now is found.' So they began to celebrate.
42:15:25:"Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. As he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
42:15:26:He called one of the servants and asked what was going on.
42:15:27:The servant replied, 'Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'
42:15:28:The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.
42:15:29:But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been working for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat to celebrate with my friends.
42:15:30:But when this son of yours comes back after squandering your property with prostitutes, you kill the fattened calf for him!'
42:15:31:"The father said, 'My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42:15:32:But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and now is found
42:16:1:Jesus shared a story with his disciples: "There was a rich man who had a manager. The manager was accused of wasting the rich man's possessions.
42:16:2:The rich man called him in and said, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can no longer be my manager.'
42:16:3:"The manager thought to himself, 'What will I do now that my boss is taking away my job? I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm too proud to beg.
42:16:4:I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job, people will welcome me into their homes.'
42:16:5:"So he called in each of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
42:16:6:'A hundred measures of olive oil,' he replied. The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.'
42:16:7:Then he asked another debtor, 'And how much do you owe?' He answered, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' The manager said, 'Take your bill and change it to eighty.'
42:16:8:"The rich man praised the dishonest manager for acting shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of light.
42:16:9:I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
42:16:10:"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
42:16:11:So if you have not been trustworthy with worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?
42:16:12:And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?
42:16:13:"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
42:16:14:The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.
42:16:15:He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.
42:16:16:"The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.
42:16:17:It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest detail of the Law to be dropped.
42:16:18:"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
42:16:19:"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
42:16:20:At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores
42:16:21:and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
42:16:22:"The time came when the beggar died, and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42:16:23:In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
42:16:24:So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue because I am in agony in this fire.'
42:16:25:"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
42:16:26:And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'
42:16:27:"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,
42:16:28:for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'
42:16:29:"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'
42:16:30:"'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'
42:16:31:"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"
42:17:1:One day, Jesus told his disciples, "It's inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the person who brings them!
42:17:2:It would be better for them if a millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
42:17:3:So be careful. If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.
42:17:4:Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and each time they come back to you saying 'I repent,' you must forgive them."
42:17:5:The apostles then said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
42:17:6:Jesus replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.
42:17:7:Imagine a servant who has been plowing or tending sheep in the field. When he comes in from the field, do you tell him, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'?
42:17:8:No, you'd say, 'Prepare my meal, get yourself ready, and serve me while I eat and drink; after that, you may eat and drink.'
42:17:9:Does the servant receive thanks for doing what he was told to do?
42:17:10:In the same way, when you've done everything you were instructed to do, you should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"
42:17:11:As Jesus continued on to Jerusalem, he traveled between Samaria and Galilee.
42:17:12:When he entered a village, ten men with leprosy met him. They stood at a distance
42:17:13:and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"
42:17:14:When Jesus saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." As they went, they were cleansed.
42:17:15:One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
42:17:16:He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.
42:17:17:Jesus asked, "Weren't all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
42:17:18:Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?"
42:17:19:Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."
42:17:20:When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God doesn't come with observable signs.
42:17:21:People won't say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' because the kingdom of God is within you."
42:17:22:Then he said to his disciples, "A time will come when you'll long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you won't see it.
42:17:23:People will say to you, 'Look, there he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.
42:17:24:For the Son of Man in his day will be like lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.
42:17:25:But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42:17:26:Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
42:17:27:People were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
42:17:28:It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
42:17:29:But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
42:17:30:It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
42:17:31:On that day, if someone is on the housetop and their possessions are inside, they shouldn't go down to get them. Likewise, if someone is in the field, they shouldn't turn back.
42:17:32:Remember Lot's wife!
42:17:33:Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.
42:17:34:I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
42:17:35:Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."
42:17:36:(Some manuscripts include verse 36: "Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.")
42:17:37:The disciples asked, "Where, Lord?" He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."
42:18:1:One day, Jesus told his disciples a story to teach them that they should always pray and not lose heart.
42:18:2:He said, "In a certain city, there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.
42:18:3:And in that same city, there lived a widow who kept coming to him, asking, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
42:18:4:For a while, the judge refused. But later, he thought to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care about people,
42:18:5:I will grant this widow her request because she keeps bothering me. Otherwise, she'll wear me out with her persistence.'"
42:18:6:Then the Lord added, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
42:18:7:Won't God bring justice for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
42:18:8:I tell you, he will see that they get justice quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
42:18:9:Jesus also told this parable to some people who were confident in their own righteousness and looked down on others:
42:18:10:"Two men went up to the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
42:18:11:The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
42:18:12:I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
42:18:13:But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling to even lift his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his chest and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
42:18:14:I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42:18:15:People were also bringing their little children to Jesus for him to bless them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
42:18:16:But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42:18:17:Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
42:18:18:A certain ruler asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42:18:19:"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone.
42:18:20:You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'"
42:18:21:"All these I have kept since I was a boy," the ruler said.
42:18:22:When Jesus heard this, he told him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
42:18:23:But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad because he was extremely wealthy.
42:18:24:Seeing his reaction, Jesus said, "How difficult it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
42:18:25:Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
42:18:26:Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"
42:18:27:Jesus replied, "What is impossible with humans is possible with God."
42:18:28:Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"
42:18:29:"Truly I tell you," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42:18:30:will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come, eternal life."
42:18:31:Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
42:18:32:He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him, and kill
42:18:33:On the third day, he will rise again."
42:18:34:But the disciples did not understand any of this; its meaning was hidden from them, and they didn't know what Jesus was talking about.
42:18:35:As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
42:18:36:Hearing the crowd passing by, he asked what was happening.
42:18:37:They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."
42:18:38:So he called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42:18:39:Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42:18:40:Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
42:18:41:"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," the blind man replied.
42:18:42:Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
42:18:43:Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
42:19:1:Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
42:19:2:A man named Zacchaeus lived there; he was a chief tax collector and very wealthy.
42:19:3:He wanted to see Jesus, but being short in stature, he couldn't see over the crowd.
42:19:4:So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to get a better view of Jesus as He passed by.
42:19:5:When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house today."
42:19:6:Zacchaeus hurried down and joyfully welcomed Jesus into his home.
42:19:7:Seeing this, everyone began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a sinner."
42:19:8:But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I will give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay them four times the amount."
42:19:9:Jesus replied, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.
42:19:10:For the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost."
42:19:11:As they listened, Jesus went on to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately.
42:19:12:He said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then return.
42:19:13:He called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and told them, 'Invest this money until I return.'
42:19:14:But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to rule over us.'
42:19:15:When he returned as king, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what they had gained with it.
42:19:16:The first servant came and said, 'Master, your mina has earned ten more.'
42:19:17:'Well done, good servant!' the master replied. 'Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'
42:19:18:The second servant came and said, 'Master, your mina has made five more.'
42:19:19:His master answered, 'You will be in charge of five cities.'
42:19:20:Then another servant came and said, 'Master, here is your mina; I have kept it hidden in a cloth.
42:19:21:I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'
42:19:22:His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow?
42:19:23:Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?'
42:19:24:Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
42:19:25:'But, master,' they said, 'he already has ten!'
42:19:26:He replied, 'I tell you, to everyone who has, more will be given; but from the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.
42:19:27:And as for those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.'"
42:19:28:After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
42:19:29:As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples ahead,
42:19:30:saying, "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
42:19:31:If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'"
42:19:32:So the disciples went and found everything just as Jesus had told them.
42:19:33:As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
42:19:34:The disciples replied, "The Lord needs it."
42:19:35:They brought the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks on it, and put Jesus on top.
42:19:36:As He went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
42:19:37:When He came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:
42:19:38:"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
42:19:39:Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
42:19:40:He answered, "I tell you, if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."
42:19:41:As He approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it
42:19:42:and said, "If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.
42:19:43:The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you, hemming you in on every side.
42:19:44:They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."
42:19:45:Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were selling there.
42:19:46:He declared, "It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers.'"
42:19:47:Every day He was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the leaders among the people were trying to kill Him.
42:19:48:Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on His words.
42:20:1:One day, as Jesus taught the people in the temple and preached the Good News, the chief priests and scribes, along with the elders, confronted Him.
42:20:2:They asked, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Who gave You this authority?"
42:20:3:Jesus replied, "I'll ask you a question too. Answer me:
42:20:4:John's baptism—was it from heaven or of human origin?"
42:20:5:They discussed among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He'll ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
42:20:6:But if we say, 'Of human origin,' all the people will stone us, because they're convinced that John was a prophet."
42:20:7:So they answered, "We don't know where it came from."
42:20:8:Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
42:20:9:Then He began to tell the people a parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to farmers, and went away for a long time.
42:20:10:At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.
42:20:11:He sent another servant, but they also beat and mistreated him, and sent him away empty-handed.
42:20:12:He sent a third, but they wounded him too and threw him out.
42:20:13:The owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I'll send my beloved son; perhaps they'll respect him.'
42:20:14:But when the tenants saw him, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so the inheritance will be ours.'
42:20:15:They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42:20:16:He'll come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, the people said, "May this never happen!"
42:20:17:Jesus looked at them and asked, "What does this Scripture mean: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
42:20:18:Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken, but anyone it falls on will be crushed."
42:20:19:The teachers of the law and the chief priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they knew He had told this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
42:20:20:Keeping a close watch on Him, they sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something He said so they could hand Him over to the power and authority of the governor.
42:20:21:They questioned Him, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach what is right, and show no favoritism but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
42:20:22:Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42:20:23:Recognizing their deceit, Jesus said to them,
42:20:24:"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" "Caesar's," they replied.
42:20:25:He said to them, "Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
42:20:26:They were unable to trap Him in His words before the people. Amazed by His answer, they became silent.
42:20:27:Some of the Sadducees, who say there's no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.
42:20:28:"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
42:20:29:Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
42:20:30:The second and then the third married her, and in the same way, all seven died, leaving no children.
42:20:31:Finally, the woman died too.
42:20:32:In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
42:20:33:Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
42:20:34:But those considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.
42:20:35:They can no longer die, for they are like the angels. They are God's children since they share in the resurrection.
42:20:36:But even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
42:20:37:He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive."
42:20:38:Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, Teacher!"
42:20:39:And no one dared to ask Him any more questions.
42:20:40:Then Jesus said to them, "How can people say that the Christ is David's son?
42:20:41:David himself declares in the Book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand
42:20:42:until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'
42:20:43:So David calls Him 'Lord.' How then can He be his son?"
42:20:44:While all the people were listening, Jesus said to His disciples,
42:20:45:"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
42:20:46:They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."
42:21:1:Jesus looked up and saw the wealthy putting their gifts into the offering box.
42:21:2:He also noticed a poor widow placing two small coins in there.
42:21:3:He said, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has given more than all the others.
42:21:4:For they have contributed out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had to live on."
42:21:5:As some people were talking about the temple and how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said,
42:21:6:"The time will come when not one stone here will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."
42:21:7:They asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"
42:21:8:He replied, "Be careful not to be deceived. Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.
42:21:9:When you hear of wars and uprisings, don't be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end won't come right away."
42:21:10:Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42:21:11:There will be great earthquakes, famines, and epidemics in various places, along with fearful events and great signs from heaven.
42:21:12:But before all this, they will arrest you, persecute you, and hand you over to synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.
42:21:13:This will be your opportunity to bear witness.
42:21:14:So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
42:21:15:For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
42:21:16:You will be betrayed even by parents, siblings, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
42:21:17:Everyone will hate you because of me.
42:21:18:But not a hair of your head will perish.
42:21:19:By standing firm, you will gain life.
42:21:20:When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that its desolation is near.
42:21:21:Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and those in the city escape, while those in the country should not enter it.
42:21:22:For these are the days of vengeance, when all that is written will be fulfilled.
42:21:23:How terrible it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42:21:24:They will fall by the sword and be taken as prisoners to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
42:21:25:There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. On earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
42:21:26:People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
42:21:27:At that time, they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
42:21:28:When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
42:21:29:He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
42:21:30:When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
42:21:31:In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
42:21:32:Truly, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
42:21:33:Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
42:21:34:Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.
42:21:35:For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
42:21:36:Always be on watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."
42:21:37:Each day, Jesus taught at the temple, and every evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives.
42:21:38:And all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
42:22:1:Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called Passover, was approaching.
42:22:2:The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to eliminate Jesus, as they feared the people.
42:22:3:Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples.
42:22:4:Judas went to the chief priests and officers to discuss how he could betray Jesus to them.
42:22:5:They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
42:22:6:He consented and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.
42:22:7:When the day of Unleavened Bread arrived, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed,
42:22:8:Jesus sent Peter and John, instructing them, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat."
42:22:9:They asked Him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?"
42:22:10:He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters.
42:22:11:Say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'
42:22:12:He will show you a large upstairs room, furnished and ready. Prepare the meal there."
42:22:13:They went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
42:22:14:When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table with the apostles.
42:22:15:He said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
42:22:16:For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
42:22:17:Taking a cup, He gave thanks and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.
42:22:18:For I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
42:22:19:He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
42:22:20:In the same way, after supper, He took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
42:22:21:But look, the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.
42:22:22:The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him!"
42:22:23:They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who would do such a thing.
42:22:24:A dispute also arose among them about which of them was considered the greatest.
42:22:25:Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority call themselves benefactors.
42:22:26:But you must not be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.
42:22:27:For who is greater, the one seated at the table or the one who serves? Isn't it the one seated at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
42:22:28:You are the ones who have stood by me during my trials.
42:22:29:And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
42:22:30:so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42:22:31:Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.
42:22:32:But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
42:22:33:Peter replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."
42:22:34:Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."
42:22:35:Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?"
42:22:36:"Nothing," they answered. He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
42:22:37:For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."
42:22:38:The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." He replied, "That is enough."
42:22:39:Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
42:22:40:When they reached the place, He said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."
42:22:41:He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed,
42:22:42:"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."
42:22:43:An angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
42:22:44:In great anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.
42:22:45:When He rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
42:22:46:"Why are you sleeping?" He asked. "Get up and pray, so that you will not fall into temptation."
42:22:47:While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by Judas, one of the twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss him.
42:22:48:But Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42:22:49:When Jesus' followers saw what was about to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"
42:22:50:One of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
42:22:51:But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And He touched the man's ear and healed him.
42:22:52:Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple guards, and elders who had come for Him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?
42:22:53:Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns."
42:22:54:They seized Jesus and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance.
42:22:55:They kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, and Peter sat among them.
42:22:56:A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."
42:22:57:But Peter denied it, saying, "Woman, I don't know him."
42:22:58:A little later, someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." Peter replied, "Man, I am not!"
42:22:59:About an hour later, another insisted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."
42:22:60:Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
42:22:61:The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."
42:22:62:And he went outside and wept bitterly.
42:22:63:The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
42:22:64:They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"
42:22:65:And they said many other insulting things to him.
42:22:66:At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.
42:22:67:"If you are the Messiah," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,
42:22:68:and if I asked you, you would not answer.
42:22:69:But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."
42:22:70:They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You say that I am."
42:22:71:Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."
42:23:1:Pilate called together the chief priests, rulers, and the people,
42:23:2:and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who stirs up the people. I've examined him in your presence and found no basis for the charges you've made against him.
42:23:3:Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Clearly, he has done nothing deserving death.
42:23:4:So, I will have him flogged and then release him."
42:23:5:But they all cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us instead!"
42:23:6:(Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion in the city and for murder.)
42:23:7:Pilate wanted to release Jesus, so he appealed to them again,
42:23:8:but they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
42:23:9:"Why? What crime has he committed?" Pilate asked. "I've found no grounds for the death penalty. I'll have him flogged and then release him."
42:23:10:But they persisted with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. And their shouts prevailed.
42:23:11:So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
42:23:12:He released the man they asked for, the one imprisoned for rebellion and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will.
42:23:13:As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country. They laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.
42:23:14:A large crowd followed, including women who mourned and lamented for him.
42:23:15:Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children.
42:23:16:For the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!'
42:23:17:Then they'll say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'
42:23:18:For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it's dry?"
42:23:19:Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.
42:23:20:When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there, along with the criminals—one on his right and the other on his left.
42:23:21:Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing." They divided his clothes by casting lots.
42:23:22:The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he's the Christ of God, the Chosen One!"
42:23:23:The soldiers also mocked him, offering him sour wine,
42:23:24:and saying, "If you're the king of the Jews, save yourself!"
42:23:25:Above him was an inscription that read, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42:23:26:One of the criminals hanging there insulted him, saying, "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
42:23:27:But the other criminal rebuked him, saying, "Don't you fear God, since you're under the same sentence?
42:23:28:We're punished justly, for we're getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."
42:23:29:Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
42:23:30:Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise."
42:23:31:It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,
42:23:32:for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
42:23:33:Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.
42:23:34:The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!"
42:23:35:All the people who had gathered to witness this sight beat their breasts and went away.
42:23:36:But those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these events.
42:23:37:A man named Joseph, a member of the council and a good and righteous man,
42:23:38:had not agreed with their decision and action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God.
42:23:39:He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
42:23:40:Joseph took the body down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock—one that had never been used before.
42:23:41:It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42:23:42:The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
42:23:43:Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath, in obedience to the commandment.
42:24:1:On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
42:24:2:They discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance of the tomb.
42:24:3:When they went inside, they couldn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42:24:4:As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared beside them, dressed in dazzling clothes.
42:24:5:The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. The men asked them, "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
42:24:6:He is not here; He has risen! Remember what He told you while He was still in Galilee:
42:24:7:'The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and rise again on the third day.'"
42:24:8:Then they remembered Jesus' words.
42:24:9:Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
42:24:10:It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who shared this news with the apostles.
42:24:11:But the apostles thought their story sounded like nonsense, so they didn't believe them.
42:24:12:Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down, he saw only the linen cloths lying there. Then he went home, amazed at what had happened.
42:24:13:That same day, two of Jesus' followers were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42:24:14:As they talked and discussed the recent events, Jesus Himself approached and began walking with them.
42:24:15:But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
42:24:16:He asked them, "What are you discussing as you walk along?" They stopped, looking sad.
42:24:17:Cleopas replied, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what's happened there recently?"
42:24:18:"What things?" Jesus asked. They answered, "The events involving Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
42:24:19:Our chief priests and rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified Him.
42:24:20:We had hoped He was the one who would redeem Israel. But it's been three days since all this took place.
42:24:21:Moreover, some women from our group astonished us. Early this morning, they went to the tomb
42:24:22:but didn't find His body. They came back saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them Jesus is alive.
42:24:23:Some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see Jesus."
42:24:24:Jesus said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
42:24:25:Didn't the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter His glory?"
42:24:26:Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written about Himself in all the Scriptures.
42:24:27:As they approached the village where they were going, Jesus acted as if He were going farther.
42:24:28:But they urged Him, "Stay with us, for it's getting late and the day is almost over." So He went in to stay with them.
42:24:29:As He sat down to eat with them, He took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them.
42:24:30:At that moment, their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. Then He vanished from their sight.
42:24:31:They said to each other, "Weren't our hearts burning within us as He talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?"
42:24:32:They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, all gathered together
42:24:33:and saying, "The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Simon!"
42:24:34:Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how Jesus was recognized by them when He broke the bread.
42:24:35:While they were still talking about this, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
42:24:36:Startled and frightened, they thought they were seeing a ghost.
42:24:37:But Jesus said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your minds?
42:24:38:Look at my hands and my feet. It's really me! Touch me and see; a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones, as you can see I have."
42:24:39:After saying this, He showed them His hands and feet.
42:24:40:While they still couldn't believe it because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42:24:41:They gave Him a piece of broiled fish,
42:24:42:and He took it and ate it in their presence.
42:24:43:Then He told them, "This is what I spoke to you about while I was still with you: Everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
