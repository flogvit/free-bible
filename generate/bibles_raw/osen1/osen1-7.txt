7:1:1:After Joshua's death, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who will lead us in our fight against the Canaanites?"
7:1:2:The LORD replied, "Judah will go first; I have given him victory over the land."
7:1:3:So Judah said to his brother Simeon, "Join me in my territory as we fight against the Canaanites, and I'll help you in your territory." And Simeon agreed.
7:1:4:With the LORD's help, Judah defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites, killing ten thousand men at Bezek.
7:1:5:There, they found Adonibezek and fought against him, defeating the Canaanites and Perizzites.
7:1:6:Adonibezek tried to escape, but they captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
7:1:7:Adonibezek admitted, "I treated seventy kings the same way, making them eat scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back." They took him to Jerusalem, where he died.
7:1:8:The people of Judah attacked Jerusalem, capturing it, killing its inhabitants, and setting the city on fire.
7:1:9:Afterward, they went to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills.
7:1:10:Judah also fought against the Canaanites in Hebron (previously called Kiriath Arba), defeating Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
7:1:11:From there, they attacked the people of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath Sepher).
7:1:12:Caleb promised his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever could capture Kiriath Sepher.
7:1:13:Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, captured the city, so Caleb gave him Achsah as his wife.
7:1:14:When Achsah arrived, she urged Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted her donkey, Caleb asked her what she wanted.
7:1:15:Achsah answered, "Give me a special gift, since you've given me land in the Negev. Please give me springs of water as well." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
7:1:16:The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went with the people of Judah from the City of Palms to the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad. They settled among the local population.
7:1:17:Judah and Simeon attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, completely destroying the city. They renamed it Hormah.
7:1:18:Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their surrounding territories.
7:1:19:The LORD was with Judah, enabling them to conquer the hill country, but they couldn't drive out the people in the valleys because they had iron chariots.
7:1:20:As Moses had instructed, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove out the three sons of Anak.
7:1:21:However, the people of Benjamin failed to drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites continued to live there alongside the Benjaminites to this day.
7:1:22:The tribes of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
7:1:23:They sent spies to Bethel (originally called Luz).
7:1:24:The spies saw a man leaving the city and asked him to show them how to enter it. In return, they promised to spare him and his family.
7:1:25:After he showed them the entrance, they killed the people in the city but spared the man and his family.
7:1:26:The man went to live with the Hittites, where he built a city and named it Luz, which remains its name today.
7:1:27:Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo, so the Canaanites continued to live there.
7:1:28:When Israel grew stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves but didn't drive them out completely.
7:1:29:Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; instead, they lived among them.
7:1:30:Zebulun also didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; the Canaanites remained and were forced to pay tribute.
7:1:31:Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Accho, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
7:1:32:The people of Asher lived among the Canaanites because they couldn't drive them out.
7:1:33:Naphtali also failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath. They lived among the Canaanites but forced them to pay tribute.
7:1:34:The Amorites pushed the tribe of Dan into the hill country and wouldn't allow them to live in the valley.
7:1:35:The Amorites continued to live in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Eventually, the house of Joseph became strong enough to force them to pay tribute.
7:1:36:The Amorite border extended from Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.
7:2:1:An angel of the Lord traveled from Gilgal to Bochim and said, "I brought you out of Egypt and led you to the land I promised your ancestors. I vowed never to break my covenant with you.
7:2:2:You were not to make any agreements with the people living in this land, and you were to destroy their altars. But you have not obeyed me. Why did you do this?
7:2:3:So now I declare that I will not drive these people out before you. They will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a trap for you."
7:2:4:When the angel of the Lord finished speaking to the Israelites, they cried out and wept.
7:2:5:They named that place Bochim and offered sacrifices to the Lord there.
7:2:6:After Joshua had sent the people away, each of the Israelites went to their own inheritance to take possession of the land.
7:2:7:The Israelites served the Lord throughout Joshua's lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived himâ€”those who had witnessed all the great things the Lord had done for Israel.
7:2:8:Joshua son of Nun, the Lord's servant, died at the age of 110.
7:2:9:They buried him within the borders of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
7:2:10:Eventually, that entire generation passed away, and a new generation rose up after them. This new generation did not know the Lord or the mighty works He had done for Israel.
7:2:11:The Israelites did what was evil in the Lord's sight, worshiping the Baals.
7:2:12:They abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed other gods, the gods of the peoples around them, bowing down to them and provoking the Lord's anger.
7:2:13:They forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
7:2:14:The Lord became angry with Israel and handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, and they could no longer withstand them.
7:2:15:Whenever the Israelites went out to fight, the Lord was against them, bringing disaster upon them, just as He had warned and sworn to them. They were in great distress.
7:2:16:But the Lord raised up judges to save them from the hands of those who plundered them.
7:2:17:Still, the Israelites did not listen to their judges. Instead, they chased after other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned away from the path their ancestors had walked, the path of obedience to the Lord's commands, and they did not follow it.
7:2:18:Whenever the Lord raised up a judge, He was with that judge and saved the Israelites from their enemies throughout the judge's lifetime. The Lord felt compassion for the Israelites because of their suffering at the hands of their oppressors and tormentors.
7:2:19:But when the judge died, the Israelites returned to their corrupt ways, even worse than before. They followed other gods, serving and worshiping them, never giving up their evil practices or stubborn ways.
7:2:20:The Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant I made with their ancestors and has not listened to me,
7:2:21:I will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left behind when he died.
7:2:22:Through these nations, I will test Israel to see whether they will keep the Lord's ways and walk in them as their ancestors did."
7:2:23:So the Lord allowed those nations to remain, not quickly driving them out or handing them over to Joshua.
7:3:1:Now, the nations that the LORD allowed to remain were meant to test Israel, particularly those who had not experienced the wars of Canaan.
7:3:2:This was done so that the generations of the Israelites could learn about war, especially those who had no prior knowledge of it.
7:3:3:The nations included the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
7:3:4:These nations were used to test Israel, to see if they would obey the LORD's commandments given to their ancestors through Moses.
7:3:5:So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
7:3:6:They married their daughters and gave their own daughters to their sons, and they worshiped their gods.
7:3:7:The Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, forgetting Him and worshiping Baal and Asherah.
7:3:8:Because of this, the LORD became angry with Israel and allowed them to be conquered by Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. The Israelites served him for eight years.
7:3:9:But when they cried out to the LORD for help, He raised up a deliverer for them: Othniel, the son of Kenaz and Caleb's younger brother.
7:3:10:The Spirit of the LORD came upon Othniel, and he became a judge for Israel. He went to war against Cushan-Rishathaim, and the LORD handed the king over to him.
7:3:11:After this, there was peace in the land for forty years until Othniel passed away.
7:3:12:Once again, the Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight, and He allowed Eglon, the king of Moab, to become powerful against them because they had done wrong.
7:3:13:Eglon gathered the Ammonites and Amalekites, attacked Israel, and took control of the City of Palms.
7:3:14:The Israelites served Eglon for eighteen years.
7:3:15:But when they cried out to the LORD, He raised up another deliverer for them: Ehud, the son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite. The Israelites sent him to deliver their tribute to King Eglon of Moab.
7:3:16:Ehud made a double-edged dagger about a foot long and strapped it to his right thigh under his clothes.
7:3:17:He presented the tribute to Eglon, who was a very obese man.
7:3:18:After delivering the tribute, Ehud sent away the people who had carried it.
7:3:19:Then he turned back at the stone idols near Gilgal and told the king he had a secret message for him. The king ordered everyone to leave the room.
7:3:20:Ehud approached Eglon as he sat alone in his cool rooftop room. "I have a message from God for you," Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat.
7:3:21:Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the dagger from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly.
7:3:22:The hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over it so that Ehud could not pull the dagger out. And the king's waste came out.
7:3:23:Ehud then locked the doors of the room and escaped.
7:3:24:When the king's servants returned, they found the doors locked and assumed he was relieving himself in his private room.
7:3:25:They waited until they became embarrassed, but when the king still didn't open the door, they took a key and unlocked it. They found their lord dead on the floor.
7:3:26:Meanwhile, Ehud had escaped past the stone idols and fled to Seirah.
7:3:27:Upon arriving there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites followed him down from the hills with him leading them.
7:3:28:"Follow me," he said, "for the LORD has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands." So they followed him and captured the fords of the Jordan River that led to Moab, allowing no one to cross.
7:3:29:At that time, they killed about ten thousand Moabite soldiers, all strong and valiant men, and not one of them escaped.
7:3:30:That day, Moab was defeated by Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
7:3:31:After Ehud, there was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who killed six hundred Philistines with an ox goad and also delivered Israel.
7:4:1:Once again, the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord after Ehud's death.
7:4:2:The Lord allowed them to be captured by Jabin, the king of Canaan, who ruled in Hazor. Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles, was the commander of his army.
7:4:3:The Israelites cried out to the Lord for help because Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots and had harshly oppressed them for twenty years.
7:4:4:At that time, Deborah, a prophetess and wife of Lapidoth, served as a judge for Israel.
7:4:5:She lived under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came to her for judgment.
7:4:6:Deborah summoned Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "Hasn't the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded you to go and gather your forces at Mount Tabor, taking ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun with you?
7:4:7:I will lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and troops, to the Kishon River, and I will give him into your hands."
7:4:8:Barak replied, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."
7:4:9:Deborah agreed, saying, "I will certainly go with you, but be aware that you won't receive any honor on this journey, for the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.
7:4:10:Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali together at Kedesh, and ten thousand men followed him. Deborah also went with them.
7:4:11:Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law, had separated from the other Kenites and set up his tent near the Oak in Zaanannim, close to Kedesh.
7:4:12:When Sisera was informed that Barak, son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor,
7:4:13:he gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and all his forces from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.
7:4:14:Deborah said to Barak, "Go! Today is the day the Lord will give you victory over Sisera, for the Lord has gone ahead of you." So Barak led his ten thousand men down from Mount Tabor.
7:4:15:The Lord threw Sisera, his chariots, and his entire army into confusion before Barak's attack. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.
7:4:16:Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all of Sisera's troops were killed by the sword; not a single man survived.
7:4:17:Meanwhile, Sisera ran to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
7:4:18:Jael went out to meet Sisera and said, "Come in, my lord, come in with me. Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
7:4:19:He asked for some water to drink because he was thirsty. She opened a bottle of milk, gave him a drink, and then covered him again.
7:4:20:He instructed her, "Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anyone asks you if there's a man inside, say 'No.'"
7:4:21:Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer, approached Sisera quietly, and drove the peg through his temple into the ground while he slept, exhausted. And so he died.
7:4:22:As Barak pursued Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said, "Come, I will show you the man you're looking for." When Barak entered her tent, he saw Sisera lying dead with the tent peg through his temple.
7:4:23:On that day, God defeated Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the Israelites.
7:4:24:The Israelites continued to gain strength and eventually destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan. FINISHED
7:5:1:On that day, Deborah and Barak, son of Abinoam, sang this song:
7:5:2:Let's praise the LORD for avenging Israel and for the people who willingly offered themselves.
7:5:3:Listen, all you kings and rulers; I will sing to the LORD, praising the God of Israel.
7:5:4:O LORD, when you marched from Seir and stepped out from Edom's fields, the earth shook, the heavens poured rain, and the clouds brought water.
7:5:5:The mountains melted before the LORD, just like Sinai did in the presence of the God of Israel.
7:5:6:During the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, and Jael, the main roads were deserted, and travelers had to use side paths.
7:5:7:Village life ceased in Israel until Deborah rose up as a mother and leader for the nation.
7:5:8:When the people chose new gods, war broke out at the city gates. Not a shield or spear was seen among Israel's forty thousand.
7:5:9:My heart goes out to the leaders of Israel who willingly offered themselves to fight. Bless the LORD!
7:5:10:You who ride on white donkeys and sit in judgment, discuss these things as you walk along the road.
7:5:11:At the watering places where archers once caused fear, the people now tell of the LORD's righteous deeds and victories in Israel. And so, the people of the LORD go down to the city gates.
7:5:12:Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Sing your song! Rise up, Barak, and lead your captives away, son of Abinoam!
7:5:13:Then the remaining warriors gained control over the nobles and powerful people. The LORD gave me victory over the mighty.
7:5:14:Ephraim's warriors uprooted Amalek, Benjamin's soldiers followed, and leaders came down from Machir and Zebulun with their writing pens.
7:5:15:Issachar's princes stood with Deborah and Barak, who fought on foot in the valley. Reuben's tribes had great inner turmoil.
7:5:16:Why did you stay among the sheepfolds, listening to the shepherd's flute? Reuben's tribes were deeply conflicted.
7:5:17:Gilead remained across the Jordan, Dan stayed by the ships, and Asher stayed on the seashore, remaining in his harbors.
7:5:18:Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives on the battlefield, fighting bravely in the open fields.
7:5:19:The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they gained no plunder or wealth.
7:5:20:From heaven, the stars fought against Sisera in their courses.
7:5:21:The Kishon River swept them away, that ancient river. O my soul, you have trampled down the strong.
7:5:22:The horses' hooves were shattered by the galloping, charging warriors.
7:5:23:May Meroz be cursed, says the angel of the LORD. Bitterly curse its inhabitants for not coming to help the LORD against the mighty.
7:5:24:Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, is blessed above all women in tents; she is truly blessed.
7:5:25:Sisera asked for water, but she gave him milk. She brought him butter in a magnificent bowl.
7:5:26:With her left hand, she reached for a tent peg, and with her right hand, she grabbed a workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, crushing his head and piercing his temple.
7:5:27:At her feet, he collapsed, fell, and lay still. At her feet, he collapsed and fell. Where he fell, there he died.
7:5:28:Sisera's mother looked out the window and cried through the lattice, "Why is his chariot taking so long to return? Why are the wheels of his chariots delayed?"
7:5:29:Her wise ladies answered her, and she repeated their words to herself,
7:5:30:"Are they not dividing the spoils? A woman or two for each man, and colorful garments for Sisera as plunder, beautifully embroidered on both sides, fit for the necks of the victors."
7:5:31:May all your enemies perish like this, O LORD! But let those who love you shine like the sun in its full strength. And so, the land had peace for forty years. FINISHED
7:6:1: The Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, so He handed them over to the Midianites for seven years.
7:6:2: The Midianites were too powerful for Israel, forcing them to hide in mountain dens, caves, and strongholds.
7:6:3: Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and eastern peoples would come and attack them.
7:6:4: They camped against the Israelites, destroying their harvests as far as Gaza, leaving no food, sheep, oxen, or donkeys.
7:6:5: These invaders came with their livestock and tents, like a swarm of locusts; both they and their camels were innumerable, and they devastated the land.
7:6:6: Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, so they cried out to the Lord for help.
7:6:7: When the Israelites cried out to the Lord about the Midianites,
7:6:8: God sent a prophet to them, saying, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up from Egypt and freed you from slavery.
7:6:9: I rescued you from the Egyptians and all who oppressed you, driving them away and giving you their land.
7:6:10: I told you that I am the Lord your God, and you should not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed me."
7:6:11: Then an angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
7:6:12: The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said, "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior."
7:6:13: Gideon replied, "If the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are the miracles our ancestors told us about, saying, 'Didn't the Lord bring us out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites."
7:6:14: The Lord turned to him and said, "With your strength, go and save Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you."
7:6:15: Gideon responded, "How can I save Israel? My family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least important in my father's house."
7:6:16: The Lord reassured him, "I will be with you, and you will defeat the Midianites as if they were just one man."
7:6:17: Gideon asked for a sign, saying, "If I have found favor in your sight, show me that it is really you talking to me.
7:6:18: Please don't leave until I return with an offering and set it before you." The angel agreed to wait for him.
7:6:19: Gideon prepared a young goat and unleavened bread made from an ephah of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, then brought them to the angel under the oak tree.
7:6:20: The angel of God instructed him, "Take the meat and bread, lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." Gideon did as he was told.
7:6:21: The angel of the Lord touched the meat and bread with the tip of his staff, causing fire to rise from the rock and consume them. Then the angel disappeared.
7:6:22: Realizing he had seen an angel of the Lord, Gideon exclaimed, "Oh no, Sovereign Lord! I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face!"
7:6:23: The Lord reassured him, "Peace be with you; do not be afraid, you will not die."
7:6:24: Gideon built an altar to the Lord there, naming it "The Lord is Peace." It still stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites today.
7:6:25: That night, the Lord instructed Gideon, "Take your father's young bull, the second one that is seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
7:6:26: Build a proper altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock, using the wood from the Asherah pole to offer the second bull as a burnt offering."
7:6:27: Gideon took ten servants and did as the Lord commanded, but he was afraid of his family and the people of the city, so he did it at night rather than during the day.
7:6:28: When the people of the city woke up the next morning, they saw that the altar of Baal had been torn down, the Asherah pole cut down beside it, and the second bull offered on the newly built altar.
7:6:29: They asked each other, "Who did this?" After investigating, they discovered that Gideon, son of Joash, was responsible.
7:6:30: The people of the city demanded that Joash bring out his son to be executed for tearing down the altar of Baal and cutting down the Asherah pole.
7:6:31: But Joash replied to the angry crowd, "Are you going to defend Baal? Are you going to save him? Whoever fights for him should be put to death by morning. If Baal is really a god, let him defend himself since his altar has been torn down."
7:6:32: So that day, Gideon was called Jerub-Baal, meaning "Let Baal contend with him," because he had torn down Baal's altar.
7:6:33: Meanwhile, all the Midianites, Amalekites, and eastern peoples joined forces and crossed the Jordan River, camping in the Valley of Jezreel.
7:6:34: The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
7:6:35: He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, calling them to join his army, and they responded.
7:6:36: Gideon said to God, "If you are truly going to use me to save Israel as you promised,
7:6:37: I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and the ground around it is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel through me, as you said."
7:6:38: And that is what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a bowlful of water.
7:6:39: Then Gideon said to God, "Please don't be angry with me, but let me make one more request. This time let the fleece be dry and the ground covered with dew."
7:6:40: That night, God did as Gideon asked: the fleece was dry, but the ground was wet with dew.
7:7:1:Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, and his army got up early and set up camp by the well of Harod. The Midianite army was to their north, near the hill of Moreh in the valley.
7:7:2:The LORD spoke to Gideon, saying, "You have too many soldiers for me to deliver the Midianites into your hands. If you win, Israel will boast that they saved themselves by their own strength.
7:7:3:So, announce to your troops, 'Anyone who is fearful or afraid may leave now and go home from Mount Gilead.'" As a result, twenty-two thousand men left, leaving only ten thousand behind.
7:7:4:But the LORD told Gideon, "There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. I will tell you who should go with you and who should not."
7:7:5:Gideon brought the men down to the water, and the LORD instructed him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like dogs from those who kneel down to drink."
7:7:6:Three hundred men lapped the water with their hands to their mouths, while the rest knelt down to drink.
7:7:7:Then the LORD said to Gideon, "With these three hundred men who lapped the water, I will save you and defeat the Midianites. Send the others home."
7:7:8:So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred men. They took provisions and trumpets from the others. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.
7:7:9:That night, the LORD told Gideon, "Get up and go down to the enemy camp, for I have given them into your hands.
7:7:10:But if you're afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Phurah first.
7:7:11:Listen to what they are saying, and then you will be encouraged to attack." So Gideon and his servant Phurah went down to the edge of the enemy camp.
7:7:12:The Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. Their camels were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.
7:7:13:As Gideon arrived, he overheard a man telling his friend about a dream he had. He said, "I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into the Midianite camp and knocked down a tent, completely flattening it."
7:7:14:His friend replied, "That can only mean one thing - the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given Midian and their entire army into his hands."
7:7:15:Upon hearing this dream and its interpretation, Gideon worshiped God. Then he returned to the Israelite camp and shouted, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite army into our hands!"
7:7:16:Gideon divided the three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a torch inside.
7:7:17:He instructed them, "Watch me and do exactly as I do. When we reach the edge of the enemy camp, follow my lead.
7:7:18:When I blow my trumpet and those with me do the same, you also blow your trumpets all around the camp and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!'"
7:7:19:Gideon and his hundred men approached the enemy camp just after the changing of the guard. They blew their trumpets and smashed their jars.
7:7:20:The other two groups did the same - blowing their trumpets, breaking their jars, and holding their torches in their left hands while shouting, "The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!"
7:7:21:They all stood their ground around the camp, causing the entire enemy army to panic, cry out, and flee.
7:7:22:As the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused confusion among the enemy soldiers, who began attacking each other. They fled toward Bethshittah, Zererath, and the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
7:7:23:Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh were called up and joined in pursuing the Midianites.
7:7:24:Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, urging them to come down and fight against the Midianites. They captured the waters of the Jordan River at Bethbarah, blocking the Midianites' escape route.
7:7:25:They also captured two Midianite commanders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was on the other side of the Jordan River.
7:8:1:The men of Ephraim asked Gideon, "Why didn't you call us when you went to fight against the Midianites?" They argued with him intensely.
7:8:2:Gideon replied, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the leftovers of Ephraim's grapes better than the full harvest of Abiezer?
7:8:3:God has given you victory over Midian's leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. What could I have done that compares to what you have achieved?" When he said this, their anger subsided.
7:8:4:Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted but still pursuing the enemy, crossed the Jordan River.
7:8:5:He asked the people of Succoth for bread for his troops, saying, "Please give some loaves of bread to my followers because they are tired, and I am chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
7:8:6:But the leaders of Succoth replied, "Have you already captured Zebah and Zalmunna, that we should provide bread for your army?"
7:8:7:Gideon warned them, "When the Lord delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will punish you with thorns and briers from the wilderness."
7:8:8:He then went to Penuel and made a similar request, but the people there responded just like those in Succoth.
7:8:9:So Gideon told them, "When I return victorious, I will tear down this tower."
7:8:10:Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their remaining forces, about fifteen thousand men, all that was left of the eastern armies, since one hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had been killed.
7:8:11:Gideon took the path used by nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah, attacking the unsuspecting enemy camp.
7:8:12:As Zebah and Zalmunna fled, Gideon pursued them, capturing the two Midianite kings and scattering their army.
7:8:13:Gideon, son of Joash, returned from battle before sunrise,
7:8:14:and captured a young man from Succoth. The youth provided the names of the city's leaders and elders, seventy-seven in total.
7:8:15:Gideon confronted the people of Succoth with his captives, saying, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, whom you taunted me about, asking if I had already captured them to justify giving bread to my exhausted men."
7:8:16:He took the city's leaders and punished them with thorns and briers from the wilderness.
7:8:17:He then tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of that city.
7:8:18:Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna about the men they had killed at Tabor. They replied, "They looked like you, each one resembling a king's son."
7:8:19:Gideon said, "They were my brothers, my mother's sons. As the Lord lives, if you had spared them, I would not kill you now."
7:8:20:He ordered his oldest son, Jether, to execute them, but Jether hesitated, as he was still young and inexperienced.
7:8:21:Zebah and Zalmunna urged Gideon, "Do it yourself, for a man's strength matches his age." So Gideon killed them and took the ornaments from their camels' necks.
7:8:22:The Israelites asked Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your descendants, for you have saved us from Midian."
7:8:23:Gideon replied, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The Lord will be your ruler."
7:8:24:He then requested, "Give me the gold earrings from your plunder." (The enemy soldiers had worn gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
7:8:25:They agreed and laid out a garment to collect the gold earrings.
7:8:26:The total weight of the gold earrings was 1,700 shekels, not including the other ornaments, garments, and camel collars taken from the Midianite kings.
7:8:27:Gideon used the gold to make an ephod, which he placed in his hometown of Ophrah. But the Israelites began to worship it, causing problems for Gideon and his family.
7:8:28:With Midian subdued, the Israelites lived in peace for forty years during Gideon's time.
7:8:29:Jerubbaal, son of Joash, returned to his home and lived there.
7:8:30:Gideon had fathered seventy sons through his many wives.
7:8:31:His concubine in Shechem also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.
7:8:32:Gideon, son of Joash, died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
7:8:33:After Gideon's death, the Israelites once again turned to idolatry, worshiping the Baals and making Baal-berith their god.
7:8:34:They forgot the Lord their God, who had saved them from all their enemies on every side.
7:8:35:They showed no gratitude to Gideon's family, despite all the good he had done for Israel.
7:9:1:Abimelech, son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to speak with his mother's relatives and the entire family of his maternal grandfather. He told them,
7:9:2:"Please talk to all the men of Shechem and ask them which is better: having all seventy sons of Jerubbaal rule over them or just one person? Remember, I am your own flesh and blood."
7:9:3:His mother's relatives shared his message with all the men of Shechem, and they decided to support Abimelech because he was their brother.
7:9:4:They gave him seventy silver coins from the temple of Baal-Berith, which Abimelech used to hire some reckless and untrustworthy men to follow him.
7:9:5:He then went to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, all on one stone. However, Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived by hiding.
7:9:6:The men of Shechem and the people of Millo gathered together and declared Abimelech king near the pillar in Shechem.
7:9:7:When Jotham heard about this, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to the people of Shechem, "Listen to me so that God will listen to you!
7:9:8:Once upon a time, the trees wanted to anoint a king over themselves. They asked the olive tree to be their ruler,
7:9:9:but the olive tree refused, saying, 'Should I give up producing my rich oil, which both gods and humans use, just to govern the trees?'
7:9:10:Then the trees asked the fig tree to rule over them,
7:9:11:but the fig tree also declined, saying, 'Should I abandon my sweet and delicious fruit just to govern the trees?'
7:9:12:Next, the trees asked the grapevine to be their king,
7:9:13:but the grapevine replied, 'Should I stop producing wine that brings joy to both gods and humans just to rule over the trees?'
7:9:14:Finally, all the trees said to the thornbush, 'You come and reign over us.'
7:9:15:The thornbush responded, 'If you truly want me to be your king, then take shelter under my shade. If not, let fire come out from me and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'
7:9:16:Now, if you have acted honestly and fairly in making Abimelech king and have treated Jerubbaal and his family well, rewarding him for what he has done,
7:9:17:remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to save you from the Midianites.
7:9:18:But today, you have turned against my father's family, killed his seventy sons on a single stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, king over the people of Shechem just because he is your relative.
7:9:19:If you have been honest and fair with Jerubbaal and his family today, then rejoice in Abimelech and let him also rejoice in you.
7:9:20:But if not, may fire come out from Abimelech and consume the people of Shechem and Millo, and may fire come out from the people of Shechem and Millo and consume Abimelech."
7:9:21:After saying this, Jotham fled to Beer, where he lived in fear of his brother Abimelech.
7:9:22:Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years,
7:9:23:but then God stirred up trouble between Abimelech and the people of Shechem, causing them to betray him.
7:9:24:This was to avenge the murder of Jerubbaal's seventy sons and to make their brother Abimelech and the people of Shechem pay for their deaths.
7:9:25:The people of Shechem set up an ambush on the mountain tops and robbed everyone who passed by. When Abimelech heard about it,
7:9:26:Gaal son of Ebed arrived in Shechem with his brothers, and the people of Shechem put their trust in him.
7:9:27:They went out into the fields, harvested their vineyards, pressed the grapes, and held a celebration. They went to their god's temple, ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech.
7:9:28:Gaal son
7:10:1:After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo from the tribe of Issachar, rose up to defend Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
7:10:2:Tola judged Israel for twenty-three years, and when he died, he was buried in Shamir.
7:10:3:Following him, Jair the Gileadite became a judge of Israel, serving for twenty-two years.
7:10:4:Jair had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which are still called Havvoth-jair to this day.
7:10:5:When Jair died, he was buried in Camon.
7:10:6:Once again, the Israelites did evil in the Lord's sight. They worshiped Baal, Ashtoreth, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and the Philistines. They abandoned the Lord and no longer served Him.
7:10:7:The Lord became angry with Israel and handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites.
7:10:8:For eighteen years, these enemies oppressed and tormented all the Israelites living east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
7:10:9:The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, causing great distress for Israel.
7:10:10:So the Israelites cried out to the Lord, saying, "We have sinned against you because we have abandoned our God and served the Baals."
7:10:11:The Lord replied, "Haven't I saved you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines?
7:10:12:When the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to me, and I rescued you from their power.
7:10:13:But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will not save you anymore.
7:10:14:Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen; let them save you when you're in trouble."
7:10:15:The Israelites said to the Lord, "We have sinned. Do whatever you think is best, but please rescue us today."
7:10:16:They got rid of the foreign gods among them and worshiped the Lord, and He was grieved by Israel's misery.
7:10:17:The Ammonites gathered and set up camp in Gilead, while the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
7:10:18:The leaders and people of Gilead asked each other, "Who will lead the fight against the Ammonites? Whoever does will become the ruler over all who live in Gilead."
7:11:1:Jephthah, a Gileadite, was a brave warrior. He was the son of a prostitute, and his father was Gilead.
7:11:2:Gilead's wife also had sons, and when they grew up, they drove Jephthah away, saying, "You won't inherit any of our father's property because you're the son of another woman."
7:11:3:So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob. A group of troublemakers joined him there, and they followed him on his adventures.
7:11:4:After some time, the Ammonites waged war against Israel.
7:11:5:When this happened, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob.
7:11:6:They said to Jephthah, "Come and be our commander so we can fight against the Ammonites."
7:11:7:Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, "Didn't you hate me and force me out of my father's house? Why do you come to me now when you're in trouble?"
7:11:8:The elders of Gilead answered Jephthah, "That's why we've turned to you now, so you can come with us, fight the Ammonites, and be our leader over all the people of Gilead."
7:11:9:Jephthah asked the elders of Gilead, "If you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gives them to me, will I really be your leader?"
7:11:10:The elders of Gilead assured Jephthah, "The Lord is our witness; we promise to do as you say."
7:11:11:So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. He repeated his conditions before the Lord in Mizpah.
7:11:12:Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, asking, "What do you have against me that you've come to fight in my land?"
7:11:13:The king of the Ammonites replied, "When Israel came out of Egypt, they took my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan. Now give it back peacefully."
7:11:14:Jephthah sent messengers back to the Ammonite king,
7:11:15:saying, "Jephthah's response is this: Israel didn't take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
7:11:16:When they came up from Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and then to Kadesh.
7:11:17:Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, requesting permission to pass through his land, but he refused. They also asked the king of Moab, who wouldn't allow it either. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
7:11:18:They went around the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon River. But they didn't enter Moab's territory because the Arnon was its border.
7:11:19:Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites in Heshbon, asking to pass through his land to their own place.
7:11:20:But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his territory, so he gathered his people and fought against Israel at Jahaz.
7:11:21:However, the Lord, the God of Israel, handed Sihon and his people over to Israel, who defeated them. As a result, Israel took possession of the land of the Amorites living there.
7:11:22:They occupied the entire Amorite territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
7:11:23:Now the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites before his people. Are you going to take their place?
7:11:24:Don't you have the right to possess what your god Chemosh gives you? In the same way, we'll possess the land of those whom the Lord our God drives out before us.
7:11:25:Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever fight against Israel or go to war with them?
7:11:26:While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the towns along the Arnon for three hundred years, why didn't you take back those lands during that time?
7:11:27:I haven't wronged you, but you're doing me harm by waging war against me. May the Lord, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites."
7:11:28:But the king of the Ammonites paid no attention to Jephthah's message.
7:11:29:Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and went on to confront the Ammonites.
7:11:30:Jephthah made a vow to the Lord, saying, "If you give the Ammonites into my hands,
7:11:31:whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering."
7:11:32:Jephthah went to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord handed them over to him.
7:11:33:He defeated them from Aroer to Minnith, capturing twenty towns, and then to Abel Keramim. It was a great victory, and the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
7:11:34:When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, his daughter came out to meet him, dancing and playing the tambourine. She was his only child; he had no other sons or daughters.
7:11:35:When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, "Oh no, my daughter! You've brought me down and filled me with sorrow, because I made a vow to the Lord that I can't break."
7:11:36:She said to him, "My father, you made a vow to the Lord. Do to me as you promised since the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites."
7:11:37:She continued, "Let me have two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends because I will never marry."
7:11:38:"You may go," he said, and he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.
7:11:39:After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she remained a virgin. This became a custom in Israel:
7:11:40:Each year, the young women of Israel would go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
7:12:1:The men of Ephraim gathered and headed north, confronting Jephthah, "Why did you go to battle against the Ammonites without calling us? We will burn your house down with you inside!"
7:12:2:Jephthah replied, "My people and I were in a great conflict with the Ammonites. I called for your help, but you didn't rescue me from their grasp.
7:12:3:Seeing that you wouldn't help, I risked my life and fought the Ammonites myself. The LORD handed them over to me. So why have you come to fight me now?"
7:12:4:Jephthah then rallied all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites defeated Ephraim because they had insulted them, saying, "You Gileadites are just fugitives from Ephraim, living among the Ephraimites and Manassites."
7:12:5:The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan River before the Ephraimites could cross. When any surviving Ephraimite asked to cross, the Gileadites would ask, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If the person said no,
7:12:6:they would tell him to say "Shibboleth." But if he said "Sibboleth," unable to pronounce it correctly, they would seize him and kill him at the Jordan River crossing. That day, 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.
7:12:7:Jephthah led Israel as judge for six years. After his death, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
7:12:8:Following Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem became Israel's judge.
7:12:9:He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters to marry men outside the family, and he brought in thirty women from outside for his sons to marry. Ibzan judged Israel for seven years.
7:12:10:After his death, Ibzan was buried in Bethlehem.
7:12:11:Next, Elon from the tribe of Zebulun became Israel's judge, serving for ten years.
7:12:12:When Elon died, he was buried in Aijalon, in the region of Zebulun.
7:12:13:After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, became Israel's judge.
7:12:14:He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon judged Israel for eight years.
7:12:15:Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
7:13:1:Once again, the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, and He handed them over to the Philistines for forty years.
7:13:2:In Zorah, there lived a man from the Danite tribe named Manoah, and his wife was unable to have children.
7:13:3:The angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and told her, "You are barren and have not been able to bear children, but you will soon become pregnant and give birth to a son.
7:13:4:So please be careful not to drink wine or strong liquor, and don't eat anything unclean.
7:13:5:You will conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor should touch his head because he will be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth. He will begin to save Israel from the Philistines."
7:13:6:The woman went to her husband and said, "A man of God came to me, and he looked like an angel of God, very awe-inspiring. I didn't ask where he was from, and he didn't tell me his name.
7:13:7:He told me that I would conceive and give birth to a son, and instructed me not to drink wine or strong liquor, nor eat anything unclean, because our child will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day he dies."
7:13:8:Manoah prayed to the Lord, saying, "Please let the man of God you sent come to us again and teach us how to raise the child who will be born."
7:13:9:God listened to Manoah's prayer, and the angel of God appeared once more to the woman while she was sitting in the field, but her husband was not with her.
7:13:10:She quickly ran to her husband and told him, "The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me again."
7:13:11:Manoah followed his wife to the man and asked, "Are you the one who spoke to my wife?" The man replied, "Yes, I am."
7:13:12:Manoah said, "May your words come true. How should we raise the child and what should we do for him?"
7:13:13:The angel of the Lord answered Manoah, "Your wife must be careful to follow everything I told her.
7:13:14:She should not eat anything that comes from grapevines, drink wine or strong liquor, or eat any unclean food. She must obey all the commands I gave her."
7:13:15:Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, "Please stay with us so we can prepare a young goat for you."
7:13:16:The angel of the Lord replied, "Even if you keep me here, I won't eat your food. But if you want to offer a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord." Manoah didn't realize he was speaking with an angel of the Lord.
7:13:17:Manoah asked the angel of the Lord, "What is your name, so we can honor you when your words come true?"
7:13:18:The angel of the Lord responded, "Why do you ask for my name? It is beyond understanding."
7:13:19:Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the Lord. The angel did something amazing while Manoah and his wife watched.
7:13:20:As the flames from the altar rose toward the sky, the angel of the Lord ascended in the fire. Manoah and his wife fell facedown on the ground.
7:13:21:The angel of the Lord did not appear to Manoah and his wife again, and then Manoah realized that it was an angel of the Lord.
7:13:22:Manoah said to his wife, "We're going to die because we've seen God."
7:13:23:But his wife replied, "If the Lord wanted to kill us, he wouldn't have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering, shown us all these things, or told us about the child we will have."
7:13:24:The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. As the boy grew, the Lord blessed him.
7:13:25:The Spirit of the Lord began to stir in Samson while he was in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
7:14:1:One day, Samson went to Timnah and saw a Philistine woman there.
7:14:2:He returned home and told his parents about her, saying, "I've seen a Philistine woman in Timnah. I want you to arrange for me to marry her."
7:14:3:His parents asked him, "Can't you find a wife among our own people? Why do you want to marry a Philistine woman who is not even circumcised?" But Samson insisted, saying, "She's the one I want; please make it happen."
7:14:4:His parents didn't realize that this was part of God's plan to create an opportunity to confront the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at the time.
7:14:5:So Samson, along with his father and mother, went back to Timnah. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, a young lion suddenly attacked Samson.
7:14:6:The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Samson, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as if it were a young goat. He didn't tell his parents what had happened.
7:14:7:Samson continued on to speak with the woman, and he found her very attractive.
7:14:8:A while later, when he went back to marry her, he decided to check on the lion's carcass. To his surprise, he found a swarm of bees and some honey inside it.
7:14:9:He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate it as he walked. When he got back to his parents, he gave them some too, but he didn't tell them where he had found it.
7:14:10:Samson's father went to see the woman, and Samson held a feast there, as was customary for young men.
7:14:11:When the Philistines saw him, they provided thirty companions to keep him company.
7:14:12:Samson said to them, "Let me tell you a riddle. If you can solve it within the seven days of the feast, I'll give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
7:14:13:But if you can't solve it, then you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes." They agreed and asked him to tell the riddle.
7:14:14:So he said, "From the eater came something to eat, and from the strong came something sweet." For three days, they couldn't figure out the answer.
7:14:15:On the seventh day, they went to Samson's wife and threatened her, saying, "Trick your husband into telling us the answer to the riddle, or we'll burn down your father's house with you inside. Did you invite us here just to rob us?"
7:14:16:Samson's wife cried in front of him, saying, "You must hate me! You gave my people a riddle but didn't tell me the answer." He replied, "I haven't even told my own parents; why should I tell you?"
7:14:17:She continued crying throughout the feast, and on the seventh day, Samson finally told her the answer because she kept pressing him. She then told her people the answer to the riddle.
7:14:18:Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the city approached Samson and said, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson replied, "If you hadn't used my wife to cheat, you wouldn't have figured out my riddle."
7:14:19:The Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson again, and he went to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty Philistine men, took their belongings, and gave their clothes to the men who had solved his riddle. Furious, Samson returned to his father's house.
7:14:20:In the meantime, Samson's wife was given to one of his companions, who had been his best man at the wedding.
7:15:1:Sometime later, during the wheat harvest season, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing a young goat as a gift. He said, "I want to see my wife in her room." But her father wouldn't let him enter.
7:15:2:Her father explained, "I thought you really hated her, so I gave her to your best man. Isn't her younger sister even more beautiful? Please take her instead."
7:15:3:Samson replied, "This time, I have a good reason to take revenge on the Philistines without being blamed."
7:15:4:So Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs, with a torch between each pair of tails.
7:15:5:He then lit the torches and released the foxes into the Philistine's fields of standing grain. The fire spread quickly, burning the stacks of grain, the standing grain, the vineyards, and the olive trees.
7:15:6:The Philistines asked, "Who did this?" When they found out it was Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife had been given to his best man, they burned the woman and her father to death.
7:15:7:Samson declared, "Since you've done this, I won't stop until I get my revenge on you."
7:15:8:He attacked them fiercely, killing many, and then went to live in a cave at the rock of Etam.
7:15:9:The Philistines came and camped in Judah, spreading out near the town of Lehi.
7:15:10:The people of Judah asked, "Why are you attacking us?" The Philistines replied, "We've come to capture Samson and do to him what he did to us."
7:15:11:Three thousand men from Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?" Samson answered, "I did to them what they did to me."
7:15:12:They told him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Promise me that you won't kill me yourselves."
7:15:13:"We won't kill you," they replied. "We'll only tie you up and hand you over to them." So they tied Samson up with two new ropes and brought him out of the cave.
7:15:14:When they arrived in Lehi, the Philistines shouted in triumph. But the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Samson, and the ropes on his arms burned like flax in a fire, freeing his hands.
7:15:15:Samson found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, picked it up, and killed a thousand men with it.
7:15:16:He then said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, I've piled them in heaps! With the jawbone of a donkey, I've killed a thousand men!"
7:15:17:After he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone away and named the place Ramath-lehi.
7:15:18:Samson was very thirsty, so he cried out to the Lord, "You've given me this great victory, but now will I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
7:15:19:God made a hole in the hollow part of the jawbone, and water came out. Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived. He named the place En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
7:15:20:Samson led Israel as a judge for twenty years during the time of the Philistines.
7:16:1:One day, Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, so he went in to spend the night with her.
7:16:2:The people of Gaza were told that Samson had come to their city. They surrounded him and waited all night at the city gate, planning to kill him at dawn.
7:16:3:But Samson got up at midnight, grabbed the city gate doors and the two posts, and carried them away, along with the crossbar. He took them to the top of a hill near Hebron.
7:16:4:Later on, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah who lived in the Valley of Sorek.
7:16:5:The Philistine rulers approached her and said, "Find out what makes Samson so strong and how we can overpower him. We want to tie him up and weaken him. If you do this, each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver."
7:16:6:So Delilah asked Samson, "Please tell me the secret of your great strength and how you could be tied up and weakened."
7:16:7:Samson replied, "If I'm tied up with seven fresh bowstrings that haven't been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man."
7:16:8:The Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven fresh bowstrings that hadn't been dried, and she tied Samson up with them.
7:16:9:Men were hiding in another room, waiting for her signal. She then shouted, "Samson, the Philistines are attacking you!" But he easily snapped the bowstrings, just like a strand of yarn burns when it touches fire. So his strength remained a mystery.
7:16:10:Delilah said to Samson, "You've made fun of me and lied to me. Now tell me the truthâ€”how can you be tied up?"
7:16:11:He answered her, "If I'm tied up with new ropes that have never been used before, I'll become as weak as any other man."
7:16:12:So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up, then shouted, "Samson, the Philistines are attacking you!" The men who were hiding in another room came out, but he broke the ropes off his arms like they were mere threads.
7:16:13:Delilah said, "You're still making fun of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied up." He told her, "Weave my seven braids of hair into a loom and tighten it with a pin."
7:16:14:She did as he instructed, then called out, "Samson, the Philistines are attacking you!" He woke up and pulled out the pin, along with the loom and the woven fabric.
7:16:15:Delilah complained, "How can you say you love me when you won't share your secret? You've made fun of me three times now and still haven't told me what makes you so strong."
7:16:16:She nagged him every day, pressing him until he couldn't take it anymore.
7:16:17:Finally, Samson told her everything. He said, "My hair has never been cut because I'm a Nazirite, dedicated to God since birth. If my hair is shaved off, my strength will leave me, and I'll be as weak as any other man."
7:16:18:When Delilah realized he had told her the truth, she sent for the Philistine rulers and said, "Come back one more timeâ€”he's finally revealed his secret." They came with the silver they had promised her.
7:16:19:Delilah lulled Samson to sleep on her lap and called for a man to shave off his seven braids. As she did this, his strength left him.
7:16:20:She shouted, "Samson, the Philistines are attacking you!" He woke up, thinking he could escape as he had before, but he didn't realize that the Lord had left him.
7:16:21:The Philistines captured him, gouged out his eyes, and took him to Gaza. They bound him in bronze chains, and he was forced to grind grain in prison.
7:16:22:But as time passed, his hair began to grow back.
7:16:23:The Philistine rulers held a great festival to celebrate their god Dagon, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy Samson into our hands."
7:16:24:The people praised their god, claiming that he had given them victory over the man who had destroyed their land and killed many of them.
7:16:25:As they were enjoying themselves, they called for Samson to be brought out from prison to entertain them. They placed him between the pillars of the temple.
7:16:26:Samson asked the young man who was guiding him, "Let me touch the pillars that support the building so I can lean against them."
7:16:27:The temple was full of men and women, including all the Philistine rulers. About 3,000 people were on the roof, watching Samson's performance.
7:16:28:Samson prayed to the Lord, saying, "O Lord God, please remember me and give me strength just this once, so I can take revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."
7:16:29:He grasped the two central pillarsâ€”one with his right hand and the other with his left.
7:16:30:Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, causing the temple to collapse on the rulers and everyone inside. He killed more people in his death than during his life.
7:16:31:His family came down to take his body, and they buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. Samson had been a judge of Israel for twenty years.
7:17:1:There once was a man from Mount Ephraim named Micah.
7:17:2:He told his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were stolen from you, which you cursed and mentioned in my presence, I have them; I took them." His mother replied, "May the LORD bless you, my son."
7:17:3:After returning the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother, she said, "I had dedicated this silver to the LORD for your benefit, intending to use it for a carved and cast idol. Now, I will give it back to you."
7:17:4:However, he gave the money back to his mother, who then took 200 pieces of silver and gave them to a metalworker, who created a carved and cast idol. This idol was placed in Micah's house.
7:17:5:Micah had a shrine with various idols, and he made an ephod and household gods. He also appointed one of his sons as a priest.
7:17:6:In those days, Israel had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right.
7:17:7:A young man from Bethlehem in Judah, who was a Levite, was living there temporarily.
7:17:8:This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a new place to live. During his journey, he arrived at Micah's house in Mount Ephraim.
7:17:9:Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" The man answered, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I'm searching for a place to stay."
7:17:10:Micah invited him, saying, "Stay with me, be like a father and a priest to me, and I will provide you with an annual salary of ten pieces of silver, clothing, and food." So the Levite agreed.
7:17:11:The Levite was happy to live with Micah, and he treated the young man like one of his own sons.
7:17:12:Micah ordained the Levite as a priest, and the young man served in Micah's house.
7:17:13:Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will bless me because I have a Levite serving as my priest."
7:18:1:In those days, Israel had no king, and the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to settle, since they had not yet received their inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
7:18:2:The Danites sent five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to explore the land and search for a suitable place to live. They told them, "Go and search the land." When they arrived at Mount Ephraim and Micah's house, they stayed there for the night.
7:18:3:While they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite man. They approached him and asked, "What brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?"
7:18:4:He replied, "Micah has taken me in, hired me, and I serve as his priest."
7:18:5:They said to him, "Please ask God for guidance, so we can know if our journey will be successful."
7:18:6:The priest told them, "Go in peace. The Lord is watching over your journey."
7:18:7:So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people lived carefree, like the Sidonians, in peace and security. There was no ruler in the land who could challenge them, and they had no dealings with anyone else.
7:18:8:The men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, and their fellow Danites asked them, "What did you find?"
7:18:9:They answered, "Get up and let's attack them! We've seen the land, and it's very good. Don't hesitate; let's go and take possession of it.
7:18:10:When you arrive, you'll find a secure and spacious land, for God has given it into your hands. It's a place where nothing is lacking on earth."
7:18:11:So six hundred armed men from the Danite families set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
7:18:12:They camped at Kirjath Jearim in Judah, which is why the place is called Mahaneh Dan to this day. It's located west of Kirjath Jearim.
7:18:13:From there, they went to Mount Ephraim and arrived at Micah's house.
7:18:14:The five men who had scouted Laish told their fellow Danites, "Did you know that there are an ephod, household idols, a carved image, and a cast idol in these houses? Think about what you should do."
7:18:15:They turned towards the house of the young Levite, Micah's house, and greeted him.
7:18:16:The six hundred armed Danites stood at the entrance of the gate.
7:18:17:The five scouts entered Micah's house, took the carved image, ephod, household idols, and cast idol, while the priest and the six hundred armed men waited at the gate.
7:18:18:When they took the items from Micah's house, the priest asked them, "What are you doing?"
7:18:19:They replied, "Be quiet and put your hand over your mouth. Come with us and be our father and priest. Isn't it better to serve a whole tribe and family in Israel rather than just one man's household?"
7:18:20:The priest was delighted, so he took the ephod, household idols, carved image, and joined the people.
7:18:21:They turned and left, placing their children, livestock, and possessions in front of them.
7:18:22:When they had traveled some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah gathered and caught up with the Danites.
7:18:23:They shouted to the Danites, who turned around and asked Micah, "What's the matter? Why have you brought this group here?"
7:18:24:Micah answered, "You've taken away my gods that I made, along with my priest. What do I have left? How can you ask me what's wrong?"
7:18:25:The Danites warned him, "Don't raise your voice against us, or some angry men might attack you, and you and your family could lose your lives."
7:18:26:So the Danites continued on their way, and Micah, realizing they were too strong for him, returned home.
7:18:27:They took the things Micah had made and his priest, then attacked the peaceful and secure people of Laish. They killed them with their swords and burned the city down.
7:18:28:There was no one to rescue them, because Laish was far from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone else. It was located in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.
7:18:29:They named the city Dan, after their ancestor who was born to Israel, although the city was originally called Laish.
7:18:30:The Danites set up the carved image, and Jonathan, son of Gershom and grandson of Manasseh, served as priest for the tribe of Dan, along with his descendants, until the land was taken into captivity.
7:18:31:They continued to use Micah's carved image, which he had made, throughout the time that God's house was in Shiloh.
7:19:1:In those days, when Israel had no king, a Levite from the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
7:19:2:But she was unfaithful to him and left him for her father's house in Bethlehem, where she stayed for four months.
7:19:3:Her husband went after her to persuade her to return, bringing his servant and two donkeys with him. When he arrived at her father's house, the girl's father was happy to see him.
7:19:4:The girl's father insisted that he stay, so he spent three days eating, drinking, and resting there.
7:19:5:On the fourth day, they woke up early, and the Levite prepared to leave. But the girl's father urged him to have some bread before departing.
7:19:6:So they sat down together and ate and drank. The girl's father then asked the Levite to spend another night and enjoy himself.
7:19:7:When the Levite tried to leave, his father-in-law convinced him to stay one more night.
7:19:8:On the fifth day, they woke up early again, but the girl's father asked the Levite to stay until the afternoon. They both ate together.
7:19:9:As the Levite prepared to leave with his concubine and servant, the girl's father said, "It's getting late; why not stay another night? Enjoy yourself, and leave early tomorrow morning for your journey home."
7:19:10:But the Levite refused to stay another night and set out toward Jebus (which is Jerusalem) with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
7:19:11:As they approached Jebus, evening was approaching, and the servant suggested they stop and spend the night in the city.
7:19:12:But the Levite insisted they continue to Gibeah, a city of Israelites, rather than stay with foreigners.
7:19:13:He told his servant they would find lodging for the night in either Gibeah or Ramah.
7:19:14:So they continued on their way, and as the sun set, they arrived near Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.
7:19:15:They turned off the road to spend the night in Gibeah, but no one offered them shelter in their home.
7:19:16:That evening, an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living temporarily in Gibeah, returned from working in the fields. The people of Gibeah were Benjaminites.
7:19:17:When the old man saw the traveler in the town square, he asked where he was going and where he had come from.
7:19:18:The Levite explained that they were traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the hill country of Ephraim and had stopped in Gibeah for the night, but no one had offered them a place to stay.
7:19:19:He assured the old man they had enough food for themselves and their animals and didn't need anything else.
7:19:20:The old man replied, "You're welcome to stay with me; just don't spend the night in the square."
7:19:21:So he took them to his home, provided food for their donkeys, and they washed their feet before eating and drinking together.
7:19:22:As they were enjoying themselves, some wicked men from the city surrounded the house and pounded on the door, demanding that the old man send out the Levite so they could have sex with him.
7:19:23:The old man went outside and pleaded with them not to commit such a terrible act, especially since the Levite was a guest in his home.
7:19:24:Instead, he offered them his virgin daughter and the Levite's concubine, telling them to do whatever they wanted with them but not to harm the Levite.
7:19:25:The men refused to listen, so the Levite brought out his concubine and handed her over to them. They raped and abused her all night long until morning, then let her go.
7:19:26:At dawn, the woman collapsed at the door of the house where her husband was staying, with her hands on the threshold.
7:19:27:When the Levite woke up and opened the door to leave, he found his concubine lying there.
7:19:28:He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But she didn't respond. So he put her body on his donkey and set off for home.
7:19:29:When he arrived, he took a knife, cut his concubine's body into twelve pieces, and sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
7:19:30:Everyone who saw this gruesome act was shocked and said, "Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen since the Israelites left Egypt. We must think carefully about what to do and discuss it together."
7:20:1:All the Israelites came together as one, from Dan to Beersheba and the land of Gilead, and they gathered before the LORD at Mizpah.
7:20:2:The leaders of all the people from every tribe of Israel took their places in the assembly of God's people, numbering 400,000 armed foot soldiers.
7:20:3:The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites asked, "Tell us how this terrible thing happened."
7:20:4:The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered, "My concubine and I arrived in Gibeah, a town in Benjamin, to spend the night.
7:20:5:During the night, the men of Gibeah surrounded the house, intending to kill me. Instead, they raped my concubine until she died.
7:20:6:I then cut her body into pieces and sent them throughout the territory of Israel, because of the horrible crime committed in our nation.
7:20:7:Now, fellow Israelites, give your advice and decide what to do."
7:20:8:Everyone stood united, saying, "None of us will return to our homes or go to our tents.
7:20:9:This is what we'll do to Gibeah: We'll attack it by drawing lots.
7:20:10:We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to gather provisions for the troops so that they can take action against Gibeah of Benjamin, as they deserve for the outrage committed in Israel."
7:20:11:So all the men of Israel gathered together against the city, united as one.
7:20:12:The tribes of Israel sent messengers to every tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this evil that has occurred among you?
7:20:13:Hand over the wicked men of Gibeah so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil." But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their fellow Israelites.
7:20:14:The Benjaminites came together from their cities to Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.
7:20:15:On that day, 26,000 sword-wielding Benjaminites assembled, along with 700 chosen men from Gibeah.
7:20:16:Among these troops were 700 left-handed warriors who could sling stones with great accuracy, not missing their target.
7:20:17:In addition to Benjamin, the Israelite soldiers numbered 400,000, all experienced in battle.
7:20:18:The Israelites went up to the house of God, seeking the LORD's guidance. They asked, "Who should go first in the battle against the Benjaminites?" The LORD replied, "Judah shall go first."
7:20:19:The next morning, the Israelites set up camp near Gibeah.
7:20:20:They went out to battle against the Benjaminites, positioning themselves for the fight at Gibeah.
7:20:21:The Benjaminites charged out of Gibeah and struck down 22,000 Israelites that day.
7:20:22:But the Israelite soldiers took courage, regrouping in the same place where they had first prepared for battle.
7:20:23:They went up and wept before the LORD until evening, asking Him, "Should we continue fighting against our fellow Israelites, the Benjaminites?" The LORD answered, "Go and fight against them."
7:20:24:So the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites on the second day.
7:20:25:Again, the Benjaminites charged out of Gibeah and killed 18,000 more Israelite soldiers, all skilled in combat.
7:20:26:All the Israelites, including the soldiers, went to the house of God, where they wept, sat before the LORD, and fasted until evening. They also offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD.
7:20:27:The Israelites inquired of the LORD (since the ark of the covenant was there at that time,
7:20:28:and Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, served as priest), asking, "Should we continue fighting against our fellow Israelites, the Benjaminites, or should we stop?" The LORD replied, "Go ahead, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands."
7:20:29:Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.
7:20:30:On the third day, the Israelites attacked the Benjaminites again, taking up
7:21:1:The men of Israel had previously made a vow in Mizpeh, stating that none of them would allow their daughters to marry a man from the tribe of Benjamin.
7:21:2:So the people gathered at the house of God and stayed there until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly before the Lord.
7:21:3:They asked, "O Lord God of Israel, why has this happened to us? Why is one of our tribes missing from Israel today?"
7:21:4:The next day, the people got up early and built an altar, where they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.
7:21:5:Then the Israelites asked, "Which of the tribes of Israel did not come to the assembly before the Lord?" They had taken a solemn oath that whoever didn't come to Mizpeh before the Lord would be put to death.
7:21:6:They felt sorry for their fellow Israelites, the Benjaminites, and said, "Today, one tribe has been cut off from Israel."
7:21:7:"What can we do to find wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters as wives?"
7:21:8:They asked, "Which of the tribes of Israel didn't come to Mizpeh before the Lord?" Then they realized that no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the assembly.
7:21:9:When they counted the people, they discovered that none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead were present.
7:21:10:So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill its inhabitants, including women and children.
7:21:11:Their instructions were to completely destroy every male and every woman who had slept with a man.
7:21:12:Among the people of Jabesh-gilead, they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
7:21:13:The entire congregation sent messengers to the Benjaminites hiding at the rock of Rimmon, offering peace and reconciliation.
7:21:14:So the Benjaminites returned, and the Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh-gilead they had spared. But there weren't enough women for all of them.
7:21:15:The people felt sorry for the tribe of Benjamin because the Lord had caused a rift among the tribes of Israel.
7:21:16:The elders of the congregation asked, "What can we do to find wives for the remaining men since the women of Benjamin have been wiped out?"
7:21:17:They decided that the survivors of Benjamin needed to have heirs so that an entire tribe wouldn't be lost from Israel.
7:21:18:However, they couldn't give them any of their own daughters as wives, because they had sworn, "Cursed is anyone who gives a wife to a Benjaminite."
7:21:19:Then they remembered that there was an annual festival of the Lord held in Shiloh, located north of Bethel, east of the road going from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.
7:21:20:So they instructed the Benjaminites, "Go and hide in the vineyards,
7:21:21:and when you see the young women of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, rush out from the vineyards, capture one woman for each of you, and return to the land of Benjamin.
7:21:22:If their fathers or brothers come to complain, we will tell them, 'Please show them mercy for our sake. We didn't provide wives for them during the war, and you are not guilty since you didn't give your daughters to them willingly.'"
7:21:23:The Benjaminites followed this plan, capturing wives for themselves from the dancers at Shiloh. Then they returned to their inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and settled in them.
7:21:24:Afterward, the Israelites dispersed, each returning to their own tribe and family, and went back to their own inheritance.
7:21:25:In those days, there was no king in Israel, and everyone did what they thought was right.
