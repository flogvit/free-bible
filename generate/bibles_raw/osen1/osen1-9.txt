9:1:1:In the hill country of Ephraim, there lived a man named Elkanah, son of Jeroham, grandson of Elihu, great-grandson of Tohu, and descendant of Zuph.
9:1:2:Elkanah had two wives; one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.
9:1:3:Every year, this man would go from his town to worship and offer sacrifices to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, sons of Eli, served as priests.
9:1:4:Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and her sons and daughters.
9:1:5:But to Hannah, he gave a double portion because he loved her, even though the Lord had closed her womb.
9:1:6:Hannah's rival, Peninnah, would provoke her constantly, making her feel miserable because she was childless.
9:1:7:This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, Peninnah would taunt her, causing her to weep and refuse to eat.
9:1:8:Elkanah, her husband, would say to her, "Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why are you so unhappy? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
9:1:9:One day, after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord's temple.
9:1:10:Deeply distressed, Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly.
9:1:11:She made a vow, saying, "Lord Almighty, if you will only notice your servant's misery and remember me, not forgetting your servant but giving her a son, I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever touch his head."
9:1:12:As she kept praying before the Lord, Eli observed her mouth.
9:1:13:Hannah was praying silently; her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
9:1:14:and said to her, "How long will you keep getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."
9:1:15:Hannah replied, "No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.
9:1:16:Do not consider your servant a wicked woman; I have been praying here because of my great anguish and grief."
9:1:17:Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request you have made of him."
9:1:18:She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then Hannah went away, ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.
9:1:19:Early the next morning, they arose and worshiped before the Lord. Then they returned home to Ramah. Elkanah slept with his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her.
9:1:20:In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked the Lord for him."
9:1:21:When Elkanah and his family went up to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and fulfill his vow,
9:1:22:Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the Lord, where he will live permanently."
9:1:23:Her husband Elkanah replied, "Do what you think is best. Stay here until you have weaned him. May the Lord fulfill his word." So Hannah stayed home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
9:1:24:When she had weaned him, she took him up to Shiloh, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.
9:1:25:After the bull was sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli.
9:1:26:Hannah said to Eli, "Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord.
9:1:27:I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me the request I made of him.
9:1:28:So now I dedicate him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he is dedicated to the Lord." Then they worshiped the Lord there.
9:2:1:Hannah prayed and said, "My heart rejoices in the Lord; my strength is exalted in the Lord. I can now laugh at my enemies because of the joy of your salvation.
9:2:2:"No one is as holy as the Lord, for there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.
9:2:3:Stop talking so proudly and let arrogance leave your mouth, for the Lord is a God who knows all, and he weighs people's actions.
9:2:4:The bows of the mighty are broken, but the weak are clothed with strength.
9:2:5:Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, while those who were hungry are now satisfied. The barren woman has borne seven children, but she who had many sons now languishes.
9:2:6:The Lord brings death and gives life; he sends some to the grave and raises others up.
9:2:7:The Lord makes poor and rich; he humbles and lifts people up.
9:2:8:He raises the lowly from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, seating them with nobles and giving them a place of honor. For the earth's foundations belong to the Lord, and he has set the world upon them.
9:2:9:He guards the steps of his faithful ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness; for it is not by strength that one prevails.
9:2:10:Those who oppose the Lord will be shattered; he will thunder against them from the heavens. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth, giving power to his king and exalting the horn of his anointed one."
9:2:11:Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed and served the Lord under the priest Eli.
9:2:12:Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no respect for the Lord
9:2:13:or for the duties of the priests to the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand
9:2:14:and plunge it into the pan, kettle, caldron, or pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
9:2:15:But even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw."
9:2:16:If the person said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would answer, "No, give it now, or I'll take it by force."
9:2:17:The sin of these young men was very great in the Lord's sight, for they were treating the Lord's offering with contempt.
9:2:18:But Samuel was ministering before the Lord, wearing a linen ephod.
9:2:19:Each year, his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
9:2:20:Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the Lord give you children by this woman to replace the one she dedicated to the Lord." Then they would go home.
9:2:21:Indeed, the Lord blessed Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.
9:2:22:Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
9:2:23:He said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.
9:2:24:No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the Lord's people.
9:2:25:If someone sins against another, God may mediate for the offender; but if someone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the Lord's will to put them to death.
9:2:26:And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.
9:2:27:A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the Lord says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they
9:2:28:were in Egypt under Pharaoh's house?
9:2:29:I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites.
9:2:30:Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'
9:2:31:Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.' But now the Lord declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.
9:2:32:The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age,
9:2:33:and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age.
9:2:34:Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
9:2:35:And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to youâ€”they will both die on the same day.
9:2:36:I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always.
9:2:37:Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"
9:3:1:In those days, young Samuel was serving the Lord under Eli's guidance. The word of the Lord was rare and visions were not common.
9:3:2:One night, Eli, whose eyesight had grown weak, lay down in his usual place.
9:3:3:The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was also lying down in the temple where the ark of God was.
9:3:4:Then the Lord called out to Samuel, and he responded, "Here I am."
9:3:5:He hurried to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli replied, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So Samuel went and lay down.
9:3:6:Once again, the Lord called, "Samuel!" Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; you called me." Eli answered, "My son, I did not call; go back and lie down."
9:3:7:Now Samuel had not yet experienced the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.
9:3:8:The Lord called Samuel a third time, and he went to Eli once more, saying, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized it was the Lord calling the boy.
9:3:9:Eli instructed Samuel, "Go, lie down, and if He calls you again, say, 'Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
9:3:10:The Lord came and stood there, calling as before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel replied, "Speak, for Your servant is listening."
9:3:11:Then the Lord told Samuel, "I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it tingle.
9:3:12:On that day, I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken concerning his family, from beginning to end.
9:3:13:I have told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he failed to restrain them.
9:3:14:Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli that their iniquity will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering."
9:3:15:Samuel lay down until morning, then opened the doors of the Lord's house. He was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.
9:3:16:But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." He replied, "Here I am."
9:3:17:Eli asked, "What did the Lord say to you? Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide anything from me that He told you."
9:3:18:So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. Eli responded, "He is the Lord; let Him do what seems good to Him."
9:3:19:As Samuel grew up, the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
9:3:20:All Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, recognized that Samuel was a true prophet of the Lord.
9:3:21:The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, revealing Himself to Samuel there through His word.
9:4:1:In those days, the Israelites went out to battle against the Philistines. They set up camp at Eben-Ezer, while the Philistines were stationed in Aphek.
9:4:2:The Philistines organized their forces for war and fought against Israel. The battle was fierce, and Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand soldiers on the battlefield.
9:4:3:When the remaining Israelite troops returned to the camp, the elders asked, "Why has the Lord allowed us to be defeated by the Philistines today? Let's bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh so it may go with us and save us from our enemies."
9:4:4:So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, accompanied the Ark.
9:4:5:As the Ark of the Covenant entered the camp, all Israel shouted with great joy, causing the earth to shake.
9:4:6:Hearing the uproar, the Philistines wondered, "What does this loud noise mean in the Hebrews' camp?" When they learned that the Ark of the Lord had arrived, 
9:4:7:they became afraid and said, "A god has come into their camp! We're in trouble! Nothing like this has ever happened before.
9:4:8:Woe to us! Who will save us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck down the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
9:4:9:Be strong, Philistines! Fight like men, or you'll become slaves to the Hebrews, just as they have been slaves to you. Be courageous and fight!"
9:4:10:So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated again. They fled to their homes, and the slaughter was immense; thirty thousand Israelite foot soldiers were killed.
9:4:11:The Ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died in battle.
9:4:12:That same day, a Benjaminite ran from the battlefield and arrived in Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head.
9:4:13:When he entered the town, Eli was sitting on his chair by the road, anxiously waiting for news about the Ark of God. When the messenger delivered the news of the Ark's capture and the deaths of his sons,
9:4:14:Eli fell backward off his chair, breaking his neck and dying, for he was an old man and heavy. He had led Israel for forty years.
9:4:15:Eli's daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been captured and her husband and father-in-law were dead, she went into labor and gave birth.
9:4:16:As she lay dying, the women attending her said, "Don't be afraid; you've given birth to a son." But she didn't respond or show any concern.
9:4:17:She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," referring to the capture of the Ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and husband.
9:4:18:She continued, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the Ark of God has been taken."
9:5:1:After the Philistines had captured the Ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
9:5:2:They took the Ark of God and placed it inside the temple of their god Dagon, setting it next to the statue of Dagon.
9:5:3:When the people of Ashdod got up early the next day, they found Dagon fallen on his face before the Ark of the Lord. They put Dagon back in his place.
9:5:4:But the following morning when they arose, Dagon was again lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord. This time, his head and both his hands were broken off, lying on the threshold; only his torso remained intact.
9:5:5:That is why, to this day, the priests of Dagon and anyone entering his temple in Ashdod do not step on the threshold.
9:5:6:Meanwhile, the Lord's heavy hand fell upon the people of Ashdod, causing devastation and striking them with tumors.
9:5:7:Seeing what was happening, the people of Ashdod said, "We cannot let the Ark of Israel's God stay here with us, for His hand is too heavy upon us and our god Dagon."
9:5:8:So they summoned all the Philistine rulers and asked, "What should we do with the Ark of Israel's God?" The rulers decided to move the Ark to the city of Gath.
9:5:9:But after they moved it there, the Lord's hand was also heavy upon that city, causing great panic. He struck the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.
9:5:10:From Gath, they sent the Ark of God to Ekron, but as it arrived, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the Ark of Israel's God to us to kill us and our people!"
9:5:11:So they called together all the Philistine rulers once more and said, "Send the Ark of Israel's God back to its own place so that it won't kill us and our people." For there was deadly panic throughout the city; God's hand was very heavy there.
9:5:12:Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the city's cry for help reached the heavens.
9:6:1:When the Ark of the LORD had been in Philistine territory for seven months,
9:6:2:the Philistines summoned their priests and fortune-tellers, asking, "What should we do with the Ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to its place."
9:6:3:They replied, "If you return the Ark of the God of Israel, don't send it away empty-handed. Be sure to give a guilt offering as well. Then you will be healed, and you'll understand why his hand hasn't been lifted from you."
9:6:4:So they asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" The priests and fortune-tellers answered, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, corresponding to the number of Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck all of you and your rulers.
9:6:5:Make images of your tumors and of the rats that are destroying the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you, your gods, and your land.
9:6:6:Why would you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When God dealt harshly with them, didn't they let the Israelites go, and they departed?
9:6:7:Now then, prepare a new cart and two milk cows that have never worn a yoke. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and keep them penned up.
9:6:8:Take the Ark of the LORD and place it on the cart. Put the gold objects you're sending as a guilt offering in a box beside it. Then send it off and let it go its way.
9:6:9:Keep an eye on it, and if it goes up the road to its own territory, toward Beth-shemesh, then the LORD has brought this great disaster upon us. But if it doesn't, we'll know that it wasn't his hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance."
9:6:10:The Philistines did as they were told. They hitched two milk cows to the cart and penned up their calves.
9:6:11:They placed the Ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box containing the gold rats and the images of their tumors.
9:6:12:The cows went straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh, staying on the path and mooing all the way, not turning to the right or left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
9:6:13:The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley when they looked up and saw the Ark. They rejoiced at the sight.
9:6:14:The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
9:6:15:The Levites took down the Ark of the LORD, along with the box containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. That day the people of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.
9:6:16:When the five Philistine rulers saw what had happened, they returned to Ekron that same day.
9:6:17:These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.
9:6:18:And the gold rats matched the number of Philistine towns ruled by the five rulersâ€”the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Ark of the LORD was placed is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
9:6:19:But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the Ark of the LORD. He struck down seventy people, and the community mourned because the LORD had inflicted such a great slaughter on them.
9:6:20:The people of Beth-shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom will the Ark go up from here?"
9:6:21:They sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the Ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to your town."
9:7:1:So, the people of Israel put away their idols of Baal and Ashtaroth and began to serve the Lord alone.
9:7:2:Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel together at Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord for you."
9:7:3:When they had come together at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. They fasted on that day and confessed, "We have sinned against the Lord." And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
9:7:4:As the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up to attack them. When the Israelites learned of this, they were afraid.
9:7:5:So they said to Samuel, "Don't stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines."
9:7:6:Samuel took a young lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him.
9:7:7:While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines approached to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered with a loud thunder against the Philistines that day and threw them into confusion, so they were defeated before Israel.
9:7:8:The Israelites chased the Philistines from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car, striking them down along the way.
9:7:9:Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far the Lord has helped us."
9:7:10:So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped invading Israel's territory. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the Lord's hand was against the Philistines.
9:7:11:The towns from Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had captured from Israel, were restored to Israel. And Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
9:7:12:Samuel continued as a judge over Israel all the days of his life.
9:7:13:Every year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.
9:7:14:But he always returned to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. He built an altar to the Lord there.
9:8:1:At the time when Samuel was old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
9:8:2:Joel and Abijah were the names of his sons, who served as judges in Beersheba.
9:8:3:However, his sons did not follow Samuel's ways; they sought dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
9:8:4:So all the elders of Israel gathered together and went to Samuel at Ramah,
9:8:5:and they said to him, "You have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king to lead us, like all the other nations have."
9:8:6:This request displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to govern us." So he prayed to the LORD.
9:8:7:The LORD told Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
9:8:8:They are doing to you just as they have done to me since the day I brought them out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods.
9:8:9:Now then, listen to their voice; but you must solemnly warn them and show them the manner of the king who will reign over them."
9:8:10:Samuel shared with the people who asked for a king all the words the LORD had spoken.
9:8:11:He said, "This is how the king who will rule over you will behave: He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots and horses, making them run before his chariots.
9:8:12:Some will be commanders of thousands and fifties, while others will work his fields and harvest his crops, or make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
9:8:13:He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
9:8:14:He will also take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials.
9:8:15:A tenth of your grain and vineyards he will take and give to his officers and servants.
9:8:16:Your male and female servants, as well as the best of your cattle and donkeys, he will take for his own use.
9:8:17:He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.
9:8:18:When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you on that day."
9:8:19:Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to Samuel's warning. "No!" they said. "We want a king over us.
9:8:20:Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles."
9:8:21:After hearing all the people had to say, Samuel repeated their words to the LORD.
9:8:22:The LORD responded, "Listen to them and give them a king." Then Samuel told the Israelites, "Go back, each of you, to your own town."
9:9:1:There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Kish, son of Abiel, grandson of Zeror, great-grandson of Becorath, and a descendant of Aphiah. He was a wealthy and influential person.
9:9:2:Kish had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no one more impressive among the Israelites than him. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else.
9:9:3:One day, Kish's donkeys went missing. So he told his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys."
9:9:4:Saul and his servant traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, the land of Shalishah, the region of Shaalim, and the territory of Benjamin, but they couldn't find the donkeys.
9:9:5:When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, "Let's go back home, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us."
9:9:6:The servant replied, "There's a man of God in this town who is highly respected. Everything he says comes true. Let's go see him; maybe he can tell us where to find the donkeys."
9:9:7:Saul said, "If we go, what can we give the man? We don't have any bread left, and there's nothing valuable to offer. What do we have?"
9:9:8:The servant answered, "I have a small silver coin. We can give that to the man of God and ask for his help."
9:9:9:In those days, if someone wanted to inquire of God, they would say, "Let's go to the seer," because the prophet used to be called a seer.
9:9:10:Saul agreed, "That's a good idea. Let's go find the man of God." So they set off for the town where the man of God lived.
9:9:11:As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water. They asked them, "Is the seer here?"
9:9:12:The women answered, "Yes, he's here. He's just ahead of you. Hurry, he has come to the town today because the people are having a sacrifice at the high place.
9:9:13:As soon as you enter the town, you'll find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won't start eating until he arrives because he must bless the sacrifice. After that, the guests will eat. Go on up now; you should find him right away."
9:9:14:So they went up to the town, and as they entered, they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place.
9:9:15:The day before Saul arrived, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:
9:9:16:"About this time tomorrow, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will save them from the Philistines' oppression. I have seen the suffering of my people and have heard their cry for help."
9:9:17:When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."
9:9:18:Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Can you please tell me where the seer's house is?"
9:9:19:Samuel replied, "I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me. In the morning, I will answer all your questions and then send you on your way.
9:9:20:As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they've been found. And now, who is more important in Israel than you and your family?"
9:9:21:Saul answered, "But I'm from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important of all the families of the tribe. Why are you saying this to me?"
9:9:22:Samuel led Saul and his servant to the dining area and seated them at the head of the table, which had about thirty guests.
9:9:23:Then Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion of meat I gave you, the one I told you to set aside."
9:9:24:The cook brought out the thigh and placed it before Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what was kept for you. Eat, for it was set aside for you for this occasion, so you could eat with the guests." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
9:9:25:Afterward, they went down from the high place to the town. A bed was prepared for Saul on the roof, and he slept there.
9:9:26:At dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, and I will send you on your way." Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside.
9:9:27:As they were approaching the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us." The servant continued on his way. Then Samuel told Saul, "Stay here, for I have an important message from God for you."
9:10:1:Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul's head. He then kissed him, saying, "The Lord has anointed you to be the leader of his people Israel. You will govern the Lord's inheritance and save them from their enemies.
9:10:2:As you leave me today, you'll meet two men near Rachel's tomb in Zelzah, in the territory of Benjamin. They'll tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found and your father is no longer worried about them; instead, he's concerned about you and wondering what to do about his missing son.
9:10:3:Continuing on your journey, you'll come to the oak tree of Tabor. There, three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you. One will be carrying three young goats, another will have three loaves of bread, and the third will have a skin of wine.
9:10:4:They'll greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you should accept from them.
9:10:5:Afterward, you'll arrive at Gibeah of God, where there's a Philistine garrison. As you approach the town, you'll encounter a group of prophets coming down from the high place, accompanied by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres. They'll be prophesying.
9:10:6:The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you powerfully, and you'll prophesy with them. You'll be transformed into a different person.
9:10:7:Once these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
9:10:8:Go ahead of me to Gilgal, and I'll join you there to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what to do."
9:10:9:As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed his heart. All these signs came to pass that very day.
9:10:10:When they arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God came upon him powerfully. He prophesied among them.
9:10:11:Everyone who had known him before saw him prophesying with the prophets and asked each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9:10:12:A man from there answered, "Who is their father?" So it became a saying, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9:10:13:After Saul finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
9:10:14:Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" Saul replied, "Looking for the donkeys. When we couldn't find them, we went to Samuel."
9:10:15:Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
9:10:16:Saul told his uncle that Samuel had assured him the donkeys were found, but he didn't mention anything about the kingship.
9:10:17:Samuel called the people together at Mizpah
9:10:18:and said to the Israelites, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'
9:10:19:But today, you've rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions. You've said to him, 'No, set a king over us.' Now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans."
9:10:20:When Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
9:10:21:Then he brought forward the clan of Matri, and Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he couldn't be found.
9:10:22:So they inquired of the Lord, "Has the man come here yet?" The Lord answered, "Yes, he's hiding among the baggage."
9:10:23:They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people, he was a head taller than anyone else.
9:10:24:Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There's no one like him among all the people." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
9:10:25:Samuel explained the rights and duties of kingship to the people, wrote them down on a scroll, and placed it before the Lord. Then he sent the people away, each to their own home.
9:10:26:Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.
9:10:27:But some scoundrels said, "How can this man save us?" They despised him and didn't bring him any gifts. However, Saul remained silent.
9:11:1:At that time, Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. The people of Jabesh-gilead said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
9:11:2:Nahash the Ammonite responded, "I'll make a treaty with you on one condition: I get to gouge out the right eye of every one of you, as a disgrace upon all Israel."
9:11:3:The elders of Jabesh replied, "Give us seven days to send messengers throughout Israel. If no one comes to save us, then we will surrender to you."
9:11:4:When the messengers arrived in Gibeah where Saul lived, they reported the news to the people, who began to weep loudly.
9:11:5:Just then, Saul returned from plowing the fields with his oxen. He asked, "What's wrong with the people? Why are they crying?" They told him about the situation in Jabesh.
9:11:6:Upon hearing this, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry.
9:11:7:He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, "This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel into battle." And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, so they united as one.
9:11:8:Saul gathered an army of 330,000 men at Bezek.
9:11:9:Then they sent word to the people of Jabesh-gilead, "By tomorrow's sun, you will be saved." When the messengers delivered the news, the people of Jabesh rejoiced.
9:11:10:They informed the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do whatever you want with us."
9:11:11:The next day, Saul divided his army into three groups. They attacked the Ammonite camp during the morning watch and continued fighting until the heat of the day. The remaining Ammonites scattered, with no two of them left together.
9:11:12:Afterward, the people said to Samuel, "Who questioned whether Saul should be king? Bring those men to us, and we will put them to death."
9:11:13:But Saul intervened, "No one will be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel."
9:11:14:Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there."
9:11:15:So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king in the presence of the Lord. They offered peace offerings to the Lord, and Saul and all the Israelites celebrated with great joy.
9:12:1:Samuel said to all Israel, "Listen, I have listened to your voice in everything you've asked of me, and I've appointed a king over you.
9:12:2:Now, here is the king who will lead you. I am old and gray, and my sons are with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.
9:12:3:Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me look the other way? I will restore it to you."
9:12:4:They replied, "You haven't cheated or oppressed us, and you haven't taken anything from anyone's hand."
9:12:5:He said to them, "The LORD is a witness against you, and his anointed is also a witness today that you have found nothing in my hand." They answered, "He is a witness."
9:12:6:Samuel said to the people, "The LORD is the one who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.
9:12:7:Now stand here so I can confront you before the LORD with all the righteous acts he has done for you and your ancestors.
9:12:8:When Jacob entered Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the LORD, and he sent Moses and Aaron, who led them out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
9:12:9:But they forgot the LORD their God, so he sold them into the hands of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, the Philistines, and the king of Moab, who fought against them.
9:12:10:They cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.'
9:12:11:So the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel, and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you lived securely.
9:12:12:But when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, moving against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us'â€”even though the LORD your God was your king.
9:12:13:Now here is the king you've chosen, the one you asked for; see, the LORD has set a king over you.
9:12:14:If you fear the LORD and serve and obey him, and don't rebel against his commands, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God.
9:12:15:But if you don't obey the LORD and rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, just as it was against your ancestors.
9:12:16:Now then, stand still and see this great thing the LORD is about to do before your eyes!
9:12:17:Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain, so that you may realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the LORD when you asked for a king."
9:12:18:Then Samuel called on the LORD, and that same day the LORD sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the LORD and of Samuel.
9:12:19:The people pleaded with Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we won't die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king."
9:12:20:Samuel replied, "Don't be afraid. You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the LORD, but serve him with all your heart.
9:12:21:Don't go after worthless things that cannot profit or deliver you; they are useless.
9:12:22:For the sake of his great name, the LORD will not reject his people, because the LORD was pleased to make you his own.
9:12:23:As for me, I will never stop praying for you and teaching you the right way to live.
9:12:24:But be sure to fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.
9:12:25:However, if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."
9:13:1:In the first year of Saul's reign over Israel, he was thirty years old.
9:13:2:He ruled over Israel for two years, and then
9:13:3:Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent back to their homes.
9:13:4:Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul sounded the trumpet throughout the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
9:13:5:All Israel heard that Saul had attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. The people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
9:13:6:The Philistines assembled to fight against Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth Aven.
9:13:7:When the Israelites saw that they were in trouble, they hid in caves, thickets, rocks, holes, and pits.
9:13:8:Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. However, Saul remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking with fear.
9:13:9:Saul waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people began to scatter.
9:13:10:So Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." Then he offered the burnt offering.
9:13:11:As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to greet him.
9:13:12:"What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,
9:13:13:I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."
9:13:14:Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly! You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you. If you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
9:13:15:But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command."
9:13:16:Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.
9:13:17:Saul, Jonathan his son, and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
9:13:18:Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,
9:13:19:another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.
9:13:20:There were no blacksmiths in Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"
9:13:21:So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes, and sickles sharpened.
9:13:22:The price was two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.
9:13:23:So on the day of battle, not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
9:14:1:One day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who carried his armor, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he didn't tell his father.
9:14:2:Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,
9:14:3:including Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh.
9:14:4:Jonathan and his armor-bearer approached the Philistine outpost, while the rest of the troops stayed with Saul.
9:14:5:The pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was flanked by two rocky cliffs; one was named Bozez and the other Seneh.
9:14:6:One cliff stood to the north near Michmash, and the other to the south near Geba.
9:14:7:Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Let's go across to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few."
9:14:8:His armor-bearer replied, "Do all that you have in mind. I am with you heart and soul."
9:14:9:Jonathan said, "We'll cross over toward the men and let them see us.
9:14:10:If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
9:14:11:But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands."
9:14:12:So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."
9:14:13:The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel."
9:14:14:Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
9:14:15:In that first attack, Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men within an area of about half an acre.
9:14:16:Then panic struck the whole armyâ€”those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding partiesâ€”and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
9:14:17:Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
9:14:18:Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.
9:14:19:Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.)
9:14:20:While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
9:14:21:Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.
9:14:22:Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
9:14:23:When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
9:14:24:So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
9:15:1:Samuel told Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, Israel. Now listen to the message from the LORD.
9:15:2:This is what the Almighty says: 'I remember what the Amalekites did to Israel when they opposed them on their way out of Egypt.
9:15:3:Now, go and attack the Amalekites, destroying everything they have. Do not spare them; put to death men, women, children, infants, cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys.'"
9:15:4:Saul gathered the troops and counted them at Telaim: there were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men from Judah.
9:15:5:Saul advanced to the city of the Amalekites and set an ambush in the valley.
9:15:6:He warned the Kenites, "Leave the Amalekites, so I won't destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
9:15:7:Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt.
9:15:8:He captured Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive, but completely destroyed all the others.
9:15:9:However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep, cattle, fat calves, lambs, and everything else that was valuable. They didn't want to destroy these things, but they totally destroyed everything that was worthless and weak.
9:15:10:The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
9:15:11:"I regret making Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and hasn't carried out My instructions." Samuel was deeply troubled and cried out to the LORD all night.
9:15:12:Early in the morning, Samuel went to meet Saul. He was informed that Saul had gone to Carmel to set up a monument in his own honor, and then had turned and traveled on to Gilgal.
9:15:13:When Samuel reached Saul, Saul said to him, "May the LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD's instructions."
9:15:14:But Samuel asked, "Then why do I hear the bleating of sheep and the lowing of cattle?"
9:15:15:Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we completely destroyed the rest."
9:15:16:"Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD told me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied.
9:15:17:Samuel said, "Although you may think little of yourself, aren't you the leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel,
9:15:18:and He sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until they are wiped out.'
9:15:19:Why didn't you obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"
9:15:20:"But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.
9:15:21:The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
9:15:22:But Samuel replied, "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying His voice? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
9:15:23:Rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king."
9:15:24:Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.
9:15:25:Now, please forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."
9:15:26:But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!"
9:15:27:As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
9:15:28:Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighborsâ€”to someone better than you.
9:15:29:The Eternal One of Israel does not lie or change His mind; for He is not a human being, that He should change His mind."
9:15:30:Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."
9:15:31:So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshipped the LORD.
9:15:32:Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him in chains, thinking, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9:15:33:But Samuel declared, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal.
9:15:34:Samuel then left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
9:15:35:Until the day Samuel died, he never saw Saul again, though he mourned for him. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
9:16:1:Now the LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have chosen one of his sons to be king."
9:16:2:Samuel asked, "How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he'll kill me." The LORD replied, "Take a young cow with you and say, 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD.'
9:16:3:Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I point out to you."
9:16:4:Samuel did as the LORD instructed and went to Bethlehem. The elders of the town trembled when they met him and asked, "Do you come in peace?"
9:16:5:He responded, "Yes, in peace; I have come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and join me in the sacrifice." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
9:16:6:When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before the LORD."
9:16:7:But the LORD said to Samuel, "Don't look at his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD doesn't see as humans see; people judge by outward appearances, but the LORD looks at the heart."
9:16:8:Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."
9:16:9:Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."
9:16:10:Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "The LORD has not chosen any of these."
9:16:11:So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" Jesse replied, "There is still the youngest, but he's out tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we won't sit down to eat until he arrives."
9:16:12:Jesse sent for the youngest son, David, who was handsome and had a healthy, ruddy complexion. The LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; this is the one."
9:16:13:Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel went back to Ramah.
9:16:14:The Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit sent by the LORD tormented him.
9:16:15:Saul's servants noticed his distress and suggested, "An evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
9:16:16:Let our lord command your servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. When the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he will play and it will soothe you."
9:16:17:Saul agreed and instructed his servants, "Find me someone who can play well and bring him to me."
9:16:18:One of the servants spoke up, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior, articulate and good-looking, and the LORD is with him."
9:16:19:So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."
9:16:20:Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
9:16:21:David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul loved him greatly, and David became one of his armor-bearers.
9:16:22:Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Please let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight."
9:16:23:Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
9:17:1:Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle, and they were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah. They set up camp between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
9:17:2:Saul and the Israelite soldiers also gathered together and camped in the Valley of Elah, preparing to face the Philistine army.
9:17:3:The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites on another, with the valley between them.
9:17:4:Out from the Philistine ranks came a champion named Goliath, from Gath. He was about nine feet tall,
9:17:5:and wore a bronze helmet and a coat of scale armor that weighed 125 pounds.
9:17:6:He had bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung across his back.
9:17:7:His spear's shaft was like a weaver's beam, and its iron point weighed 15 pounds. A shield-bearer walked ahead of him.
9:17:8:Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite battle lines, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Choose a man from among you to fight me.
9:17:9:If he can defeat me in combat, we will become your subjects; but if I prevail against him and kill him, you shall become our subjects and serve us."
9:17:10:Goliath continued, "Today I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man to fight!"
9:17:11:Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified when they heard Goliath's challenge.
9:17:12:David, son of Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah, had three older brothers who served in Saul's army. Jesse was an old man during the time of King Saul.
9:17:13:The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the war: Eliab, the firstborn; Abinadab, the second; and Shammah, the third.
9:17:14:David was the youngest. While the three oldest brothers stayed with Saul,
9:17:15:David went back and forth from Saul's camp to tend his father's sheep in Bethlehem.
9:17:16:For forty days, Goliath, the Philistine champion, came forward every morning and evening to present his challenge.
9:17:17:One day, Jesse said to David, "Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers at the battlefront.
9:17:18:Also, take these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are doing and bring back news of them."
9:17:19:Saul, along with David's brothers and all the other Israelites, were fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah.
9:17:20:Early the next morning, David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelite army was leaving for the battle lines, shouting their war cry.
9:17:21:Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines facing each other.
9:17:22:David left his supplies with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines, and greeted his brothers.
9:17:23:While he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his ranks and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.
9:17:24:When the Israelites saw Goliath, they fled in terror.
9:17:25:They said to each other, "Have you seen this man who keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his family from taxes in Israel."
9:17:26:David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9:17:27:They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."
9:17:28:When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he became angry and asked, "Why have you come down here? With whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your arrogance and your wicked heart; you came down only to watch the battle
9:17:29:"Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?"
9:17:30:He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.
9:17:31:What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, who sent for him.
9:17:32:David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."
9:17:33:Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth."
9:17:34:But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,
9:17:35:I went after it, struck it, and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it, and killed it.
9:17:36:Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has defied the armies of the living God.
9:17:37:The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the Lord be with you."
9:17:38:Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic, put a coat of armor on him, and placed a bronze helmet on his head.
9:17:39:David fastened his sword over the tunic and tried walking around because he was not used to them. "I can't go in these," he said to Saul, "I'm not used to them." So he took them off.
9:17:40:He took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag, and with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.
9:17:41:The Philistine, with his shield-bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.
9:17:42:He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him.
9:17:43:He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
9:17:44:"Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!"
9:17:45:David replied, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
9:17:46:This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
9:17:47:All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give all of you into our hands."
9:17:48:As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
9:17:49:Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.
9:17:50:So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand, he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
9:17:51:David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.
9:17:52:Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
9:17:53:When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
9:17:54:David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem;
9:17:55:he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.
9:17:56:As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don't know."
9:17:57:The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."
9:17:58:As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with Goliath's head still in his hand.
9:17:59:Saul asked him, "Whose son are you, young man?" David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."
9:18:1:After David had finished talking with Saul, he and Jonathan became the closest of friends. Jonathan loved him as much as himself.
9:18:2:Saul took David in that day and wouldn't let him return to his father's house.
9:18:3:Jonathan and David made a covenant because of their deep friendship and love for each other.
9:18:4:Jonathan removed his robe and gave it to David, along with his armor, sword, bow, and belt.
9:18:5:David went on to achieve great success in everything he did, as Saul had assigned him various tasks. This made Saul put him in charge of the men of war, which was well received by the people and Saul's officers.
9:18:6:As they returned from defeating the Philistines, the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul, playing musical instruments and celebrating joyfully.
9:18:7:The women sang as they danced, "Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands."
9:18:8:Saul became very angry at this song, and it upset him. He thought, "They have credited David with tens of thousands, but only thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?"
9:18:9:From that day on, Saul kept a close eye on David.
9:18:10:The next day, an evil spirit from God suddenly took control of Saul, causing him to behave erratically while David played the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand,
9:18:11:and he hurled it at David, intending to pin him to the wall. But David dodged the spear twice.
9:18:12:Saul became afraid of David because the Lord was with David but had left him.
9:18:13:So, Saul removed David from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand men. David led the troops in battle,
9:18:14:and he continued to be successful in all his campaigns because the Lord was with him.
9:18:15:When Saul saw how very successful David was, he became even more afraid of him.
9:18:16:But all Israel and Judah loved David since he led them in their campaigns.
9:18:17:Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife; just continue to serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord." Saul thought, "I don't need to raise my hand against him; let the Philistines do that!"
9:18:18:David responded, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
9:18:19:But when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was instead given to Adriel the Meholathite as his wife.
9:18:20:Now Michal, Saul's other daughter, fell in love with David, and when Saul heard about it, he was pleased.
9:18:21:Saul thought, "I'll give her to him so that she may become a trap for him, and the Philistines will be against him." So Saul said to David, "Today you have a second chance to become my son-in-law."
9:18:22:Then Saul ordered his servants to speak privately with David, saying, "Look, the king likes you, and all his servants love you; now become his son-in-law."
9:18:23:Saul's servants repeated these words to David, but he replied, "Do you think it's a small thing to become the king's son-in-law? I'm just a poor man and have no reputation."
9:18:24:The servants reported back to Saul what David had said.
9:18:25:Saul then said, "Tell David this: 'The king doesn't want any dowry other than the foreskins of a hundred Philistines, as revenge on his enemies.'" Saul planned to use this demand to cause David's death at the hands of the Philistines.
9:18:26:When his servants told David about Saul's proposal, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. Before the allotted time,
9:18:27:David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as a full payment to Saul to become his son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal as his wife.
9:18:28:Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved him.
9:18:29:Saul became even more afraid of David, and he remained his enemy for the rest of his days.
9:18:30:The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, but every time they did, David was more successful than any of Saul's other officers. This made his name highly respected.
9:19:1:In those days, Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and all his servants about their intention to kill David.
9:19:2:But Jonathan, who cherished David deeply, informed him of his father's plot.
9:19:3:He told David, "My father Saul is seeking your life. Be on your guard tomorrow morning, and find a secret place to hide.
9:19:4:I'll go out and stand by my father in the field where you are hiding. I'll speak with him about you, and if I learn anything, I'll let you know."
9:19:5:Jonathan spoke highly of David to his father Saul, saying, "The king shouldn't sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been beneficial to you.
9:19:6:He risked his life when he killed the Philistine, and the Lord brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced, so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
9:19:7:Saul listened to Jonathan's words and swore, "As the Lord lives, David will not be killed."
9:19:8:Jonathan summoned David and told him everything they had discussed. He then brought David to Saul, and David continued to serve the king as before.
9:19:9:Once again, war broke out, and David went to fight the Philistines. He defeated them with such force that they fled from him.
9:19:10:But an evil spirit sent by the Lord came upon Saul as he sat in his house, holding his spear. David was playing the harp,
9:19:11:and Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear. David evaded him twice.
9:19:12:Saul became afraid of David, for the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul.
9:19:13:So Saul removed David from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand men. David led his troops in battle
9:19:14:and was successful in all his endeavors because the Lord was with him.
9:19:15:Seeing David's success, Saul became even more afraid of him.
9:19:16:But all Israel and Judah loved David, as he went out and came in before them.
9:19:17:Then Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife, but you must be brave and fight the Lord's battles." Saul thought, "I won't have to raise my hand against him; let the Philistines do that."
9:19:18:David responded, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
9:19:19:When it was time for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was instead given to Adriel the Meholathite as his wife.
9:19:20:Meanwhile, Michal, Saul's other daughter, fell in love with David. When Saul heard about this, he was pleased.
9:19:21:He thought, "I'll give her to David so she can be a snare to him, and the Philistines can defeat him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have another chance to become my son-in-law."
9:19:22:Saul ordered his servants to speak privately with David, saying, "Look, the king is fond of you, and all his servants love you. Now become his son-in-law."
9:19:23:His servants relayed these words to David, but he replied, "Do you think it's a trivial matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm just a poor man and of little importance."
9:19:24:When Saul's servants reported back to him, they told him what David had said.
9:19:25:Saul then said, "Tell David this: 'The king doesn't want any dowry except for a hundred Philistine foreskins, as revenge on his enemies.'" Saul planned to have David killed by the Philistines.
9:19:26:When his servants told David about this proposal, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. Before the allotted time,
9:19:27:David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins back to the king to fulfill the requirement for becoming his son-in-law. So Saul gave him his daughter Michal as his wife.
9:19:28:Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved him.
9:19:29:Saul grew even more afraid of David, and he remained his enemy for the rest of his days.
9:19:30:The Philistine commanders continued to fight against Israel, but every time they went into battle, David proved more successful than any of Saul's other officers. His name became well-known and respected.
9:20:1:One day, David approached Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? Why does your father want to kill me?"
9:20:2:Jonathan replied, "No way! You're not going to die. My father doesn't do anything without telling me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not true."
9:20:3:David insisted, "Your father knows that we are friends, so he's keeping this a secret from you. But I swear, I'm only one step away from death!"
9:20:4:Jonathan said, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it for you."
9:20:5:David explained, "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I'm supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let me hide in the field until the evening of the third day.
9:20:6:If your father notices I'm missing, tell him that I went to Bethlehem, my hometown, for an annual sacrifice my family has to attend.
9:20:7:If he says it's fine, then I'll know I'm safe. But if he gets angry, you'll know he's planning to harm me.
9:20:8:Please show me kindness as long as I live, and if I die, never stop showing kindness to my family."
9:20:9:Jonathan agreed, "I promise to do what you ask. If I find out my father wants to harm you, I'll warn you."
9:20:10:David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
9:20:11:Jonathan proposed a plan, "Come, let's go out into the field." So they went there together.
9:20:12:Jonathan said to David, "I'll make a covenant with you because I love you as much as I love myself.
9:20:13:Tomorrow, when my father notices you're missing, I'll ask him about it. Then I'll let you know what he says.
9:20:14:I'll shoot three arrows near a certain rock as if I'm practicing archery.
9:20:15:Then I'll send a boy to fetch the arrows. If I say to him, 'The arrows are closer,' come out of hiding because it's safe. But if I say, 'The arrows are farther away,' run away because my father wants to harm you.
9:20:16:Remember our agreement and the oath we took in the Lord's name."
9:20:17:David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.
9:20:18:Saul sat in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan across from him and Abner beside him. But David's place was empty.
9:20:19:Saul didn't say anything that day, thinking David might be unclean for some reason.
9:20:20:But on the second day, when David's place was still empty, Saul asked Jonathan, "Why hasn't David come to the meal yesterday or today?"
9:20:21:Jonathan answered, "David asked for my permission to go to Bethlehem.
9:20:22:He said, 'Please let me go, because our family is holding a sacrifice there, and my brother has ordered me to attend. If you approve, let me go and see my relatives.' That's why he isn't at the king's table."
9:20:23:Saul became furious with Jonathan and yelled, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't you realize that as long as David is alive, you'll never be king? Now go and bring him to me, because he deserves to die!"
9:20:24:Jonathan asked his father, "Why should David be killed? What has he done?"
9:20:25:Saul threw his spear at Jonathan, trying to kill him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.
9:20:26:Jonathan left the table in anger and didn't eat any food on the second day of the festival, because he was upset about David and his father's shameful behavior.
9:20:27:The next morning, Jonathan went out to the field where David was hiding, taking a young boy with him.
9:20:28:He told the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.
9:20:29:When the boy reached the spot where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan shouted, "The arrow is farther away!"
9:20:30:The boy collected the arrow and returned to his master, not knowing what was going on. Only Jonathan and David knew
9:20:31:Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him, "Go back to town with these." The boy went back to town, unaware of what had happened.
9:20:32:After the boy left, David came out from his hiding place near the rock and bowed down before Jonathan three times, showing great respect.
9:20:33:They embraced each other and wept together, but David wept the most.
9:20:34:Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship in the name of the Lord, saying, 'The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'"
9:20:35:David left, and Jonathan returned to the town.
9:21:1:David visited the priest Ahimelech in Nob. Ahimelech trembled when he met David and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"
9:21:2:David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king has given me a mission, but he told me not to reveal it to anyone. I have instructed my men to meet me at a certain place.
9:21:3:Now, please, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever is available."
9:21:4:The priest replied, "I don't have any ordinary bread, only holy bread. You can have it if your men have kept themselves from women."
9:21:5:David responded, "Indeed, my men have been away from women for some time. Whenever we go on a mission, they keep themselves pure, even though it's an ordinary mission. How much more so today!"
9:21:6:So the priest gave him the holy bread, since there was no other bread except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord, replaced by fresh bread on the day it was taken away.
9:21:7:Now, one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.
9:21:8:David asked Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or sword here? I didn't bring my sword or weapons with me because the king's mission was urgent."
9:21:9:The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it, for there is no other sword here." David replied, "There's none like it; give it to me."
9:21:10:David then fled that day from Saul and went to Achish, the king of Gath.
9:21:11:The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? They sing about him in their dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.'"
9:21:12:David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish, the king of Gath.
9:21:13:So he pretended to be insane in their presence; he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
9:21:14:Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why have you brought him to me?
9:21:15:Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act as a madman in my presence? Must this man come into my house?"
9:22:1:David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's family heard about it, they went down to him there.
9:22:2:Everyone who was in distress, in debt, or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
9:22:3:From there, David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay with you until I learn what God will do for me."
9:22:4:He left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.
9:22:5:The prophet Gad told David, "Don't stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
9:22:6:Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. Saul was seated under a tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in hand and all his officials standing around him.
9:22:7:Saul said to his officials, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
9:22:8:You have conspired against me. No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today."
9:22:9:Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, answered, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek, son of Ahitub, at Nob.
9:22:10:Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him, gave him provisions, and also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
9:22:11:Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were priests at Nob. They all came to the king.
9:22:12:Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." He answered, "Yes, my lord."
9:22:13:Saul asked him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him, so he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today."
9:22:14:Ahimelek replied to the king, "Who among all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, and highly respected in your household?
9:22:15:Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Please don't accuse your servant or any of my father's family, for your servant knows nothing about this whole affair."
9:22:16:But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your father's whole family."
9:22:17:Then the king ordered the guards at his side, "Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord.
9:22:18:The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day, he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
9:22:19:Nob, the city of the priests, was put to the sword, including men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.
9:22:20:But one son of Ahimelek, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David.
9:22:21:He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.
9:22:22:David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.
9:22:23:Stay with me; don't be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me."
9:23:1:When David was informed that the Philistines were attacking the town of Keilah and stealing its grain,
9:23:2:he asked the LORD, "Should I go and fight against these Philistines?" The LORD answered, "Go, for you will surely defeat the Philistines and save Keilah."
9:23:3:But David's men said to him, "We're afraid here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Keilah to battle the Philistine forces?"
9:23:4:Once again, David inquired of the LORD, who replied, "Go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
9:23:5:So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines, and took their livestock. In this way, they saved the people of Keilah.
9:23:6:Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech had fled to David at Keilah, he brought the ephod with him.
9:23:7:Saul learned that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has delivered him into my hands, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars."
9:23:8:Saul summoned all his forces to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
9:23:9:David, aware that Saul was plotting against him, said to the priest Abiathar, "Bring the ephod here."
9:23:10:Then David prayed, "O LORD, God of Israel, I have heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.
9:23:11:Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down, as I have heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell your servant." The LORD answered, "Saul will come down."
9:23:12:David asked, "Will the people of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" The LORD replied, "They will."
9:23:13:So David and his men, numbering about six hundred, left Keilah and moved from place to place. When Saul learned that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
9:23:14:David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day, Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.
9:23:15:While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he discovered that Saul had come out to take his life.
9:23:16:Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and encouraged him in his faith in God,
9:23:17:saying, "Don't be afraid, for my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father knows this is true."
9:23:18:The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then David remained at Horesh, while Jonathan returned home.
9:23:19:Some Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "David is hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon.
9:23:20:Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you, and we will be responsible for handing him over to you."
9:23:21:Saul responded, "May you be blessed by the LORD for your concern for me.
9:23:22:Go and make further preparations. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there, for I am told he is very cunning.
9:23:23:Discover all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with reliable information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the region, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah."
9:23:24:So the Ziphites set out ahead of Saul, but David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.
9:23:25:Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David in the Desert of Maon.
9:23:26:Saul was going along one side of the mountain, while David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces closed in on David and his men to capture them,
9:23:27:a messenger arrived to tell Saul, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land."
9:23:28:So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.
9:23:29:David then went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
9:24:1:Once, when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was informed that David was in the wilderness of Engedi.
9:24:2:So, Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
9:24:3:He came across a cave along the way and went in to relieve himself. Unbeknownst to him, David and his men were hiding in the depths of the cave.
9:24:4:David's men whispered to him, "This is your chance! The Lord has delivered your enemy into your hands. Do as you wish." So, David crept up to Saul and cut off a corner of his robe without him noticing.
9:24:5:Afterward, David felt guilty for cutting off a piece of Saul's robe.
9:24:6:He told his men, "The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, or lay a hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord."
9:24:7:With these words, David restrained his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. Saul then left the cave and continued on his way.
9:24:8:Later, David emerged from the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down with his face to the ground in respect.
9:24:9:Then David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to people who say I am trying to harm you?
9:24:10:Look, today you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you, saying, 'I will not lay a hand on my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.'
9:24:11:See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.
9:24:12:May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.
9:24:13:As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.
9:24:14:Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
9:24:15:May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand."
9:24:16:When David finished speaking, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.
9:24:17:"You are more righteous than I," he said to David. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.
9:24:18:You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.
9:24:19:When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you with good for what you have done for me today.
9:24:20:Now I realize that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
9:24:21:Swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."
9:24:22:So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
9:25:1:Now, there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. He was a very wealthy man with three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. At the time, he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
9:25:2:This man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was harsh and evil in his dealings.
9:25:3:When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
9:25:4:he sent ten young men, instructing them, "Go up to Carmel and visit Nabal. Greet him in my name,
9:25:5:and say to him, 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household, and good health to all that is yours!
9:25:6:Now I hear that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we treated them well. They didn't miss anything while they were in Carmel.
9:25:7:Ask your servants, and they will tell you. Therefore, be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.'"
9:25:8:David's young men came to Nabal and delivered the message in David's name. Then they waited.
9:25:9:Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants break away from their masters these days.
9:25:10:Why should I take my bread, my water, and the meat I've prepared for my shearers and give it to men who come from who knows where?"
9:25:11:David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.
9:25:12:David said to his men, "Each of you, strap on your sword!" So they did, and David strapped on his as well. About four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
9:25:13:One of Nabal's servants told Abigail, Nabal's wife, "David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master a greeting, but he hurled insults at them.
9:25:14:Yet these men were very good to us. They never harmed us, and nothing we had was stolen during the time we were with them in the fields.
9:25:15:They were like a protective wall around us, both day and night, all the time we were with them tending the sheep.
9:25:16:Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his entire household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."
9:25:17:Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins, and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.
9:25:18:Then she told her servants, "Go ahead, I'll follow you." But she didn't tell her husband Nabal.
9:25:19:As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.
9:25:20:David had just said, "It's been uselessâ€”all my watching over this fellow's property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has repaid me evil for good.
9:25:21:May God deal severely with David if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!"
9:25:22:When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before him, her face to the ground.
9:25:23:Falling at his feet, she said, "Pardon me, my lord, let me take the blame. Please hear what your servant has to say.
9:25:24:Please pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his nameâ€”his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men you sent.
9:25:25:Now, my lord, as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands. May your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal.
9:25:26:Let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you.
9:25:27:Please forgive your servant's offense, for the Lord will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.
9:25:28:Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God. But he will hurl away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling.
9:25:29:When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel,
9:25:30:my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord has brought my lord success, remember your servant."
9:25:31:David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.
9:25:32:May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.
9:25:33:Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak."
9:25:34:Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."
9:25:35:When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak.
9:25:36:Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him, and he became like a stone.
9:25:37:About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
9:25:38:When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
9:25:39:His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife."
9:25:40:She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord's servants."
9:25:41:Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David's messengers and became his wife.
9:25:42:David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.
9:25:43:But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
9:26:1:One day, people told David, "Look, Saul is in the Desert of Ziph at Hachilah Hill."
9:26:2:So David sent spies and confirmed that Saul had indeed set up camp there.
9:26:3:David went to the area near Saul's camp. He saw where Saul and Abner, son of Ner, his army commander, were lying down. Saul was lying inside the camp with his soldiers surrounding him.
9:26:4:Then David asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go with me into the camp to Saul?" Abishai replied, "I'll go with you."
9:26:5:That night, David and Abishai entered the camp. They found Saul sleeping with a spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were asleep around him.
9:26:6:Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won't need to strike him twice."
9:26:7:But David responded, "Don't kill him! No one can lay a hand on the Lord's anointed without being guilty. 
9:26:8:As the Lord lives," David continued, "the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
9:26:9:But let's not harm him now, for the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord's anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug near his head, and let's go."
9:26:10:So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep.
9:26:11:David crossed to the other side of the hill and stood at a distance on top of the mountain. There was a wide space between them.
9:26:12:He called out to the army and to Abner, "Abner, won't you answer me?" Abner replied, "Who are you that calls to the king?"
9:26:13:David said to Abner, "Aren't you a great man? Who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.
9:26:14:You have failed in your duty. As surely as the Lord lives, you deserve to die, because you did not protect your master, the Lord's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?"
9:26:15:Saul recognized David's voice and asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes, it is, my lord the king."
9:26:16:And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?
9:26:17:Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. But if it is people, may they be cursed before the Lord! They have driven me today from sharing in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
9:26:18:Now don't let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord. The king of Israel has come out to look for a fleaâ€”as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
9:26:19:Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted foolishly and have been very wrong."
9:26:20:"Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.
9:26:21:The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord's anointed.
9:26:22:As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble."
9:26:23:Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
9:27:1:David thought to himself, "One day I'll be killed by Saul's hand. The best thing for me to do is escape to Philistine territory. Then Saul will stop searching for me throughout Israel, and I can finally get away from him."
9:27:2:So David left with his six hundred men and went to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
9:27:3:David stayed with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families. David had his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, who had been Nabal's wife from Carmel.
9:27:4:When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he stopped looking for him.
9:27:5:David asked Achish, "If you're pleased with me, please give me a place to live in one of the smaller towns. I don't need to stay in the royal city with you."
9:27:6:That day, Achish gave David the town of Ziklag. Since then, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah.
9:27:7:David lived in Philistine territory for a year and four months.
9:27:8:During that time, David and his men would raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. These people had lived in the land stretching from Telam all the way to Shur and Egypt.
9:27:9:Whenever David attacked these territories, he would not leave anyone alive, neither man nor woman. He took the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothes, and then returned to Achish.
9:27:10:When Achish asked, "Where did you raid today?" David would say, "Against the southern region of Judah," or "Against the southern region of Jerahmeel," or "Against the southern region of the Kenites."
9:27:11:David never allowed any survivors to come back to Gath. He thought, "They might inform on us, saying, 'This is what David has done.'" And that's how David acted the entire time he lived in Philistine territory.
9:27:12:Achish trusted David, thinking, "He must be completely hated by his people, the Israelites. He will serve me forever."
9:28:1:At that time, the Philistines gathered their forces for war against Israel. Meanwhile, Achish told David, "You must know that you and your men will accompany me in the battle."
9:28:2:David replied to Achish, "Very well, you will see what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Then I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard."
9:28:3:Now Samuel had passed away, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his hometown of Ramah. Saul had also removed mediums and spiritists from the land.
9:28:4:The Philistine forces assembled and camped at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa.
9:28:5:When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified and filled with fear.
9:28:6:He prayed to the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him through dreams, Urim, or prophets.
9:28:7:Saul then said to his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may consult her." His servants replied, "There's a medium in Endor."
9:28:8:So Saul disguised himself, putting on different clothes, and went with two of his men to the woman at night. He said to her, "Please conduct a sÃ©ance for me and bring up the person I request."
9:28:9:The woman replied, "You surely know what Saul has doneâ€”how he's eliminated mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you trying to trap me and have me put to death?"
9:28:10:Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, "As surely as the Lord lives, you won't be punished for this."
9:28:11:Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" Saul responded, "Bring up Samuel."
9:28:12:When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
9:28:13:The king reassured her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman replied, "I see a spirit coming up out of the ground."
9:28:14:Saul asked, "What does he look like?" She answered, "An old man is coming up, wearing a robe." Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down with his face to the ground.
9:28:15:Samuel asked Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I'm in great distress because the Philistines are at war with me, and God has turned away from me. He doesn't answer me anymore, neither through prophets nor dreams. So I've called on you to tell me what I should do."
9:28:16:Samuel replied, "Why do you consult me now that the Lord has turned away from you and become your enemy?
9:28:17:The Lord has done what he foretold through me: He has torn the kingdom from your hands and given it to your neighbor David.
9:28:18:Because you did not obey the Lord's command and didn't carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has brought this disaster upon you today.
9:28:19:Moreover, the Lord will deliver Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me, and the Lord will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines."
9:28:20:Immediately, Saul collapsed, falling full length on the ground, terrified by Samuel's words. He was weak because he had eaten nothing all day and night.
9:28:21:The woman came over to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken. She said, "Look, I've obeyed you at the risk of my life; now please listen to your servant's advice and let me give you some food. You must eat to regain your strength for the journey ahead."
9:28:22:Saul refused, saying, "I won't eat." But his men and the woman urged him until he finally gave in. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
9:28:23:The woman quickly prepared a fattened calf she had, baked some unleavened bread, and set it before Saul and his men.
9:28:24:After they had eaten, they got up and left that very night.
9:29:1:Around that time, the Philistines gathered their armies for war against Israel. Achish told David, "You know you and your men must join me in battle."
9:29:2:David replied, "Very well, you'll see what we can do." Achish said, "Then I will make you my personal bodyguard for life."
9:29:3:Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his hometown. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.
9:29:4:The Philistines assembled and came to Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp in Gilboa.
9:29:5:When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified and deeply shaken.
9:29:6:Saul inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams, Urim, or prophets.
9:29:7:So Saul told his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and consult her." His servants informed him, "There's a medium in Endor."
9:29:8:Saul disguised himself, putting on different clothes, and went with two of his men to the woman at night. He said, "Consult a spirit for me, and bring up the one I name."
9:29:9:But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you trying to trap me and get me killed?"
9:29:10:Saul swore to her by the Lord, "As surely as the Lord lives, no punishment will come upon you for this."
9:29:11:Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" He answered, "Bring up Samuel."
9:29:12:When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
9:29:13:The king reassured her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman replied, "I see a ghostly figure coming up out of the earth."
9:29:14:Saul asked, "What does he look like?" She said, "An old man is coming up, wearing a robe." Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself.
9:29:15:Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul answered, "I'm in great distress; the Philistines are attacking me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or dreams. So I've called on you to tell me what to do."
9:29:16:Samuel replied, "Why do you consult me, since the Lord has turned away from you and become your enemy?
9:29:17:The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighborsâ€”to David.
9:29:18:Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today.
9:29:19:The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines."
9:29:20:Immediately, Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.
9:29:21:The woman came to Saul, and seeing that he was terrified, she said, "Your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.
9:29:22:Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way."
9:29:23:He refused and said, "I can't eat." But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he finally listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
9:29:24:The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she quickly killed. She took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
9:29:25:She served it to Saul and his men, and they ate. Then they got up and left that same night.
9:30:1:David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Meanwhile, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag, attacking Ziklag and burning it down.
9:30:2:They had taken captive the women and everyone else in the city, both young and old. They did not kill anyone but carried them off as they went on their way.
9:30:3:When David and his men arrived at the city, they found it burned down, and their wives, sons, and daughters taken captive.
9:30:4:Then David and the people with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep.
9:30:5:David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had also been taken captive.
9:30:6:David was greatly distressed because the people talked about stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of their sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
9:30:7:David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelek, "Please bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
9:30:8:David inquired of the LORD, asking, "Should I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" The LORD answered him, "Pursue them, for you will certainly overtake them and rescue the captives."
9:30:9:So David set out with his six hundred men and came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind.
9:30:10:Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit.
9:30:11:They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eatâ€”
9:30:12:part of a cake of pressed figs and two clusters of raisins. After he had eaten, his strength returned, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and nights.
9:30:13:David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where are you from?" He replied, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.
9:30:14:We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory belonging to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."
9:30:15:David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."
9:30:16:He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking, and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.
9:30:17:David fought against them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels.
9:30:18:David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
9:30:19:Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.
9:30:20:He also took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."
9:30:21:Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David approached, he greeted them.
9:30:22:But some wicked and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered, except for each man's wife and children. Let them take those and go."
9:30:23:David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us.
9:30:24:Who will listen to what you say? The share of the one who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of the one who went down to the battle. All will share alike."
9:30:25:David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day forward, and it is still followed today.
9:30:26:When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."
9:30:27:He sent gifts to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, Jattir,
9:30:28:Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
9:30:29:Racal, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, the towns of the Kenites,
9:30:30:Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach,
9:30:31:and Hebron, as well as to all the other places where David and his men had roamed.
9:31:1:In the final battle against the Philistines, the Israelites were defeated, and they fled from their enemies.
9:31:2:The Philistines pursued and killed many Israelite soldiers on Mount Gilboa.
9:31:3:The battle intensified, and eventually, the Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons. They killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
9:31:4:Saul was critically wounded by enemy archers. Unable to escape, he said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that these uncircumcised Philistines won't abuse and mock me." But his armor-bearer was too afraid to do it, so Saul took his own life with his sword.
9:31:5:When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died alongside him.
9:31:6:Thus, Saul, his three sons, and his armor-bearer all perished on the same day.
9:31:7:When the remaining Israelites in the nearby towns learned of the defeat and the deaths of Saul and his sons, they abandoned their homes and fled. The Philistines then occupied those towns.
9:31:8:The next day, the Philistines came to strip the slain and found the bodies of Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa.
9:31:9:They cut off Saul's head and stripped him of his armor. Then they sent messengers throughout Philistine territory to spread the news and celebrate their victory.
9:31:10:They placed Saul's armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
9:31:11:When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
9:31:12:their bravest warriors marched all night, retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and returned to Jabesh.
9:31:13:They burned the bodies there,
9:31:14:and buried their bones under a tamarisk tree in Jabesh. They fasted for seven days to mourn their loss.
