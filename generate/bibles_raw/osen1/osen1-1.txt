1:1:1:In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
1:1:2:The earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the deep waters, and the Spirit of God hovered over the surface.
1:1:3:Then God said, "Let there be light," and light appeared.
1:1:4:God saw that the light was good, so He separated the light from the darkness.
1:1:5:He named the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning followed—the first day.
1:1:6:Next, God said, "Let there be a space between the waters to separate them."
1:1:7:So God made the expanse and divided the waters beneath it from those above. And it was so.
1:1:8:He called the expanse "sky." Evening passed, and morning came—the second day.
1:1:9:Afterward, God said, "Let the waters under the sky come together in one place, so dry ground may appear." And it happened.
1:1:10:God named the dry ground "land" and the gathered waters "seas." He saw that it was good.
1:1:11:Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each with its own kind of seed." And it was so.
1:1:12:The land produced vegetation—plants bearing seeds according to their kinds and trees producing fruit with seeds inside. God saw that it was good.
1:1:13:Evening came, then morning followed—the third day.
1:1:14:God said, "Let there be lights in the sky's expanse to separate day from night, and to mark seasons, days, and years."
1:1:15:They will serve as lights in the sky's expanse to shine on the earth." And it happened.
1:1:16:God created two great lights—the greater one to rule the day and the lesser one to rule the night—and He also made the stars.
1:1:17:He placed them in the sky's expanse to light up the earth,
1:1:18:to govern the day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.
1:1:19:Evening passed, and morning came—the fourth day.
1:1:20:God said, "Let the waters swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the sky's expanse."
1:1:21:So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves in the water, according to their kinds, as well as every winged bird, each according to its kind. God saw that it was good.
1:1:22:He blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
1:1:23:Evening came, then morning followed—the fifth day.
1:1:24:God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.
1:1:25:God made the wild animals, livestock, and all creatures that crawl on the ground, each according to its kind. He saw that it was good.
1:1:26:Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, after our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, and all the earth and its creatures that crawl."
1:1:27:So God created human beings in His own image; He created them male and female.
1:1:28:He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every living thing that moves on the earth."
1:1:29:God said, "Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the earth and every fruit tree with seed inside for food.
1:1:30:And to all the animals of the earth, the birds of the sky, and everything that crawls on the ground—to everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
1:1:31:Finally, God looked over everything He had made, and He saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning followed—the sixth day.
1:2:1:Thus, the heavens and the earth were completed, along with everything in them.
1:2:2:By the seventh day, God had finished the work He was doing; so He rested from all His work on that day.
1:2:3:God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for on it He ceased from all the work of creation that He had done.
1:2:4:This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, at the time when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
1:2:5:No shrub had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant sprouted; for the Lord God hadn't sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to cultivate the ground.
1:2:6:But a mist rose up from the earth, watering the entire surface of the land.
1:2:7:Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
1:2:8:Next, the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, toward the east, where He placed the man He had formed.
1:2:9:The Lord God caused all sorts of trees to grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
1:2:10:A river flowed from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four branches.
1:2:11:The name of the first branch is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
1:2:12:The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also found there.
1:2:13:The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
1:2:14:The third river is named Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
1:2:15:The Lord God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
1:2:16:And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat from every tree of the garden,
1:2:17:but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it, you will certainly die."
1:2:18:Then the Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
1:2:19:Out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
1:2:20:The man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the sky, and every wild animal. But for Adam, no suitable helper was found.
1:2:21:So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, He took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
1:2:22:Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man.
1:2:23:The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."
1:2:24:For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
1:2:25:The man and his wife were both naked, but they felt no shame.
1:3:1:Now the serpent was more cunning than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He asked the woman, "Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?"
1:3:2:The woman replied to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
1:3:3:but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"
1:3:4:"You won't surely die," the serpent said to the woman.
1:3:5:"For God knows that when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you'll become like God, knowing good and evil."
1:3:6:When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eye, and desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it too.
1:3:7:Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
1:3:8:Later, they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden during the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
1:3:9:But the LORD God called out to the man, "Where are you?"
1:3:10:He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
1:3:11:And God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?"
1:3:12:The man replied, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
1:3:13:Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What have you done?" The woman answered, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
1:3:14:So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.
1:3:15:And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."
1:3:16:To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
1:3:17:To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.
1:3:18:It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
1:3:19:By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."
1:3:20:Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.
1:3:21:The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
1:3:22:And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
1:3:23:So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
1:3:24:After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
1:4:1:Adam slept with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said, "I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD."
1:4:2:Later, she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel became a shepherd of sheep, while Cain worked the soil as a farmer.
1:4:3:As time went by, Cain brought some of the fruits from the ground as an offering to the LORD.
1:4:4:Abel also brought an offering—some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering,
1:4:5:but He didn't accept Cain and his offering. This made Cain very angry, and his face fell.
1:4:6:Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you so upset? Why has your face fallen?
1:4:7:If you do what's right, won't you be accepted? But if you don't do what's right, sin is crouching at your door; it wants to control you, but you must master it."
1:4:8:Cain talked with his brother Abel. Later, when they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
1:4:9:The LORD asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain replied, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
1:4:10:God said, "What have you done? Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.
1:4:11:Now you're cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
1:4:12:When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You'll be a restless wanderer on the earth."
1:4:13:Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.
1:4:14:You're driving me from the land today, and I'll be hidden from your presence. I'll be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
1:4:15:But the LORD said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
1:4:16:So Cain left the LORD's presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
1:4:17:Cain slept with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.
1:4:18:To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, who fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
1:4:19:Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
1:4:20:Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
1:4:21:His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
1:4:22:Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.
1:4:23:Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
1:4:24:If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
1:4:25:Adam slept with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
1:4:26:Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD.
1:5:1:This is the record of the descendants of Adam. When God created humanity, He made them in His own likeness.
1:5:2:He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, He named them "human."
1:5:3:When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
1:5:4:After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:5:So Adam's total lifetime was 930 years, and then he died.
1:5:6:Seth lived 105 years and then fathered Enosh.
1:5:7:After Enosh was born, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:8:The total lifetime of Seth was 912 years, and then he died.
1:5:9:Enosh lived 90 years and then fathered Kenan.
1:5:10:After Kenan was born, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:11:The total lifetime of Enosh was 905 years, and then he died.
1:5:12:Kenan lived 70 years and then fathered Mahalalel.
1:5:13:After Mahalalel was born, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:14:The total lifetime of Kenan was 910 years, and then he died.
1:5:15:Mahalalel lived 65 years and then fathered Jared.
1:5:16:After Jared was born, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:17:The total lifetime of Mahalalel was 895 years, and then he died.
1:5:18:Jared lived 162 years and then fathered Enoch.
1:5:19:After Enoch was born, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:20:The total lifetime of Jared was 962 years, and then he died.
1:5:21:Enoch lived 65 years and then fathered Methuselah.
1:5:22:Enoch walked with God after Methuselah was born for 300 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
1:5:23:The total lifetime of Enoch was 365 years.
1:5:24:Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God took him away.
1:5:25:Methuselah lived 187 years and then fathered Lamech.
1:5:26:After Lamech was born, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:27:The total lifetime of Methuselah was 969 years, and then he died.
1:5:28:Lamech lived 182 years and then fathered a son.
1:5:29:He named him Noah, saying, "This one will bring us comfort from our work and the painful toil of our hands, caused by the ground the LORD has cursed."
1:5:30:After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
1:5:31:The total lifetime of Lamech was 777 years, and then he died.
1:5:32:When Noah was 500 years old, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1:6:1:When people began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them,
1:6:2:the divine beings saw that these daughters were beautiful, and they took wives for themselves from any they chose.
1:6:3:Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not remain with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be limited to 120 years."
1:6:4:In those days, there were giants on the earth, as well as later on, when the divine beings had children with human women. These children became mighty heroes of ancient times, famous men.
1:6:5:As the Lord observed how great the wickedness of humanity had become on the earth, He saw that every thought and inclination of people's hearts was only evil all the time.
1:6:6:This deeply grieved the Lord, and He regretted creating humans on the earth.
1:6:7:So the Lord said, "I will wipe out humanity, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—people, animals, crawling creatures, and birds in the sky—for I regret having made them."
1:6:8:But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
1:6:9:Here is the story of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.
1:6:10:Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1:6:11:The earth was corrupt in God's sight and filled with violence.
1:6:12:God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
1:6:13:So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
1:6:14:Build yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
1:6:15:This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.
1:6:16:Make a roof for the ark, finishing it to within one cubit from the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle, and upper decks.
1:6:17:I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every living thing that has the breath of life. Everything on earth will perish.
1:6:18:But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
1:6:19:You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
1:6:20:Two of every kind of bird, animal, and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive.
1:6:21:Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up as food for you and for them."
1:6:22:Noah did everything just as God had commanded him.
1:7:1:Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.
1:7:2:Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate; and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,
1:7:3:and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, so that their offspring will survive on the face of all the earth.
1:7:4:In seven days, I will send rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe out every living thing I have created from the face of the ground."
1:7:5:Noah did everything the LORD commanded him.
1:7:6:Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.
1:7:7:So he, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
1:7:8:Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,
1:7:9:came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.
1:7:10:After the seven days, the floodwaters arrived on the earth.
1:7:11:In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
1:7:12:Rain fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
1:7:13:On that very day, Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
1:7:14:They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.
1:7:15:Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
1:7:16:The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
1:7:17:For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.
1:7:18:The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
1:7:19:They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
1:7:20:The waters rose more than twenty feet, covering even the highest mountains.
1:7:21:Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
1:7:22:Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
1:7:23:Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the sky were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
1:7:24:And the waters continued to cover the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
1:8:1: Then God remembered Noah, as well as all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to recede.
1:8:2: The underground springs and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the heavens ceased.
1:8:3: Gradually, the waters receded from the earth. After 150 days, the waters had significantly decreased.
1:8:4: On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
1:8:5: As the waters continued to recede, the mountaintops became visible at the end of the tenth month.
1:8:6: After forty more days, Noah opened the window he had made in the ark,
1:8:7: and released a raven. It flew back and forth until the waters on the earth had dried up.
1:8:8: Next, Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded enough for it to find dry ground.
1:8:9: But the dove couldn't find a place to rest because there was still water covering the entire earth. So, it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back inside.
1:8:10: Noah waited seven more days and again sent the dove out from the ark.
1:8:11: In the evening, the dove returned to him, carrying a freshly plucked olive leaf in its beak. This showed Noah that the waters had receded even further.
1:8:12: Noah waited another seven days and sent out the dove once more. This time, it didn't return to him.
1:8:13: When Noah was 601 years old, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
1:8:14: By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was completely dry.
1:8:15: God spoke to Noah, saying,
1:8:16: "Come out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons, and their wives.
1:8:17: Bring out every living creature with you – the birds, the livestock, and all the creatures that move along the ground – so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful."
1:8:18: So Noah, his family, and all the animals left the ark, just as God had commanded.
1:8:19: All the living creatures, the birds, the livestock, and those that moved on the ground, came out of the ark, each according to their kind.
1:8:20: Then Noah built an altar to the Lord. He took some of every clean animal and bird, and offered them as burnt offerings on the altar.
1:8:21: The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of humanity, even though their hearts are inclined toward evil from childhood. I will not destroy all living creatures as I have done.
1:8:22: As long as the earth endures, there will be planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night."
1:9:1:After the flood, God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, filling the earth.
1:9:2:And I promise that all creatures on earth will live in fear and dread of you - the birds in the sky, the animals on land, and the fish in the sea. They are all given into your hands.
1:9:3:Every living thing that moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you green plants, now I give you everything.
1:9:4:However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it.
1:9:5:And I will demand an accounting for the life of every creature; from each person, I will require a reckoning for the life of their fellow human beings.
1:9:6:Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God, He created mankind.
1:9:7:As for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out across the earth and increase in number."
1:9:8:Then God spoke to Noah and his sons with him, saying,
1:9:9:"I now establish my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
1:9:10:and with every living creature that was with you - the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you - every living thing on earth.
1:9:11:I establish this covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."
1:9:12:And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
1:9:13:I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
1:9:14:Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
1:9:15:I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
1:9:16:When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
1:9:17:So God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."
1:9:18:The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
1:9:19:These three were the sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.
1:9:20:Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.
1:9:21:When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.
1:9:22:Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
1:9:23:But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked backward and covered their father's naked body. Their faces were turned away so they would not see their father naked.
1:9:24:When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,
1:9:25:he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers."
1:9:26:He also said, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
1:9:27:May God extend Japheth's territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth."
1:9:28:After the flood, Noah lived 350 years.
1:9:29:Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
1:10:1:Now, these are the generations of Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had children after the flood.
1:10:2:The descendants of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
1:10:3:Gomer's offspring included Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
1:10:4:Javan's descendants were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
1:10:5:From these families, the people of the coastlands spread out into their territories, each with their own language and according to their clans and nations.
1:10:6:Ham's descendants were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
1:10:7:Cush's offspring were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. Raamah's children were Sheba and Dedan.
1:10:8:Cush also fathered Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
1:10:9:Nimrod was a great hunter before the Lord, which is why people say, "Like Nimrod, a great hunter before the Lord."
1:10:10:The beginning of Nimrod's kingdom was Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
1:10:11:From that land, he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
1:10:12:and Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is the great city.
1:10:13:Mizraim fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
1:10:14:Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines descended), and Caphtorim.
1:10:15:Canaan's descendants were Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,
1:10:16:as well as the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
1:10:17:Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
1:10:18:Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. Later, the Canaanite clans spread out.
1:10:19:The Canaanite border extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
1:10:20:These are the descendants of Ham, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
1:10:21:Sons were also born to Shem, Japheth's older brother and the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
1:10:22:Shem's descendants were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
1:10:23:Aram's offspring included Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
1:10:24:Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.
1:10:25:To Eber, two sons were born: Peleg, because the earth was divided during his days, and his brother's name was Joktan.
1:10:26:Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
1:10:27:Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
1:10:28:Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
1:10:29:Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan's sons.
1:10:30:Their dwelling place stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, the eastern hill country.
1:10:31:These are the descendants of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
1:10:32:This is the account of Noah's family, as they spread throughout the earth and formed nations after the flood.
1:11:1:At one time, the whole world spoke a single language and shared a common vocabulary.
1:11:2:As people migrated from the east, they discovered a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
1:11:3:They said to each other, "Let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." So they used bricks instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
1:11:4:Then they proposed, "Let's build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so we can make a name for ourselves and not be scattered across the face of the earth."
1:11:5:The Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the people were building.
1:11:6:And the Lord said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
1:11:7:Come, let us go down and confuse their language, so they will not understand each other."
1:11:8:So the Lord scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city.
1:11:9:That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there, the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
1:11:10:This is the account of Shem's family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
1:11:11:After the birth of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:12:When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
1:11:13:After the birth of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:14:When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.
1:11:15:After the birth of Eber, Shelah lived 403 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:16:When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.
1:11:17:After the birth of Peleg, Eber lived 430 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:18:When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.
1:11:19:After the birth of Reu, Peleg lived 209 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:20:When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.
1:11:21:After the birth of Serug, Reu lived 207 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:22:When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.
1:11:23:After the birth of Nahor, Serug lived 200 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:24:When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.
1:11:25:After the birth of Terah, Nahor lived 119 more years and had other sons and daughters.
1:11:26:After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
1:11:27:This is the account of Terah's family line. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
1:11:28:Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans, while his father Terah was still alive.
1:11:29:Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
1:11:30:Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive.
1:11:31:Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
1:11:32:Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
1:12:1:Now the Lord said to Abram, "Leave your country, your family, and your father's household, and go to the land that I will show you.
1:12:2:I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing.
1:12:3:I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all families on earth will be blessed through you."
1:12:4:So Abram went, as the Lord had instructed him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
1:12:5:Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all their possessions they had accumulated, and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan.
1:12:6:When they arrived in Canaan, Abram traveled through the land to the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
1:12:7:The Lord appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your offspring." So Abram built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
1:12:8:From there, he moved to the hill country east of Bethel and set up his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built another altar to the Lord and worshiped Him.
1:12:9:Then Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev.
1:12:10:There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
1:12:11:As he approached Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know you are a beautiful woman.
1:12:12:When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but let you live.
1:12:13:Please tell them you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."
1:12:14:When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was indeed very beautiful.
1:12:15:Pharaoh's officials noticed her and praised her to Pharaoh. Consequently, she was taken into his palace.
1:12:16:He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
1:12:17:But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai.
1:12:18:So Pharaoh summoned Abram and asked, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
1:12:19:Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"
1:12:20:Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him away, along with his wife and everything he had.
1:13:1:So Abram went up from Egypt, he, his wife, and everything he had, along with Lot, into the Negev.
1:13:2:Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.
1:13:3:From the Negev, he journeyed from place to place until he arrived at Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier
1:13:4:and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the Lord.
1:13:5:Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.
1:13:6:But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they couldn't live side by side.
1:13:7:And quarrels arose between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.
1:13:8:Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are relatives.
1:13:9:Isn't the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left."
1:13:10:Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
1:13:11:So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:
1:13:12:Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
1:13:13:Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the Lord.
1:13:14:The Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.
1:13:15:All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
1:13:16:I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
1:13:17:Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you."
1:13:18:So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the Lord.
1:14:1:At that time, Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim
1:14:2:formed an alliance and went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
1:14:3:All these kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (which is now the Dead Sea).
1:14:4:They had served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
1:14:5:In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
1:14:6:and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El-paran, near the desert.
1:14:7:Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
1:14:8:Subsequently, the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and arrayed for battle in the Valley of Siddim
1:14:9:against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
1:14:10:The Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their men fell into them, while the rest escaped to the hill country.
1:14:11:Chedorlaomer and his allies then took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, along with their food supplies, and left.
1:14:12:They also captured Lot, Abram's nephew who lived in Sodom, and carried off his possessions since he was living there.
1:14:13:A survivor came and informed Abram the Hebrew, who was staying near the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allies of Abram.
1:14:14:When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out his trained men, born in his household, numbering 318, and pursued the captors as far as Dan.
1:14:15:During the night, Abram divided his forces and attacked, defeating Chedorlaomer and his allies. He chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus,
1:14:16:and recovered all the goods, as well as his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and other people who had been captured.
1:14:17:After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
1:14:18:Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, brought out bread and wine
1:14:19:and blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
1:14:20:and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.
1:14:21:The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself."
1:14:22:But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand in an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
1:14:23:that I will not accept anything belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you cannot say, 'I made Abram rich.'
1:14:24:I will take nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who accompanied me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them have their share."
1:15:1:After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield and your exceedingly great reward."
1:15:2:Abram replied, "Lord GOD, what will you give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my household is Eliezer of Damascus?"
1:15:3:Abram continued, "You have given me no offspring, so a servant born in my house will inherit my possessions."
1:15:4:Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will inherit your possessions."
1:15:5:God took Abram outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can. So shall your descendants be."
1:15:6:Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
1:15:7:God also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as an inheritance."
1:15:8:But Abram asked, "Lord GOD, how can I know that I will indeed possess it?"
1:15:9:God instructed him, "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
1:15:10:Abram brought all these animals to God, cut them in half, and placed each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in half.
1:15:11:Birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
1:15:12:As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came over him.
1:15:13:Then the LORD told Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land not their own, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.
1:15:14:But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward, they will come out with great possessions.
1:15:15:As for you, you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.
1:15:16:In the fourth generation, your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
1:15:17:When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals.
1:15:18:On that day, the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants, I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates River—
1:15:19:the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
1:15:20:Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim,
1:15:21:Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."
1:16:1:Now, Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne him any children. She had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
1:16:2:Sarai said to Abram, "Look, the Lord has prevented me from having children. Please sleep with my servant; perhaps I can have a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
1:16:3:So after Abram had been living in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.
1:16:4:Abram slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When Hagar realized she was pregnant, she began to look down on her mistress Sarai.
1:16:5:Sarai complained to Abram, saying, "The wrong done to me is your fault! I gave my servant into your arms, but now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me!"
1:16:6:Abram replied, "Your servant is in your hands; do with her as you see fit." So Sarai treated Hagar harshly, and Hagar ran away from her.
1:16:7:The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert—the spring on the way to Shur.
1:16:8:He asked, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She answered, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai."
1:16:9:Then the angel of the Lord told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her authority."
1:16:10:The angel added, "I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count."
1:16:11:The angel of the Lord also said to her, "You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard your misery.
1:16:12:He will be like a wild donkey among people; his hand will be against everyone, and everyone's hand will be against him. He will live in hostility toward all his brothers."
1:16:13:Hagar named the Lord who spoke to her, "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "Have I truly seen the One who sees me?"
1:16:14:That is why the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
1:16:15:So Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
1:16:16:Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
1:17:1:When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless.
1:17:2:Then I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will greatly increase your numbers."
1:17:3:Abram fell facedown, and God spoke with him, saying,
1:17:4:"As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
1:17:5:No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
1:17:6:I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will create nations from you, and kings will come from you.
1:17:7:I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you, for generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
1:17:8:The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God."
1:17:9:God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
1:17:10:This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
1:17:11:You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
1:17:12:For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.
1:17:13:Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
1:17:14:Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
1:17:15:God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
1:17:16:I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
1:17:17:Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"
1:17:18:And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"
1:17:19:Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
1:17:20:And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
1:17:21:But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year."
1:17:22:When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
1:17:23:On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God had told him.
1:17:24:Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
1:17:25:and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
1:17:26:Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.
1:17:27:And every male in Abraham's household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
1:18:1:The Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.
1:18:2:Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. He quickly left the entrance of his tent to meet them, bowing low to the ground.
1:18:3:He said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.
1:18:4:Let a little water be brought, so you may wash your feet and rest under this tree.
1:18:5:Allow me to bring some bread for you to refresh yourselves. Then you can continue on your journey, since you have come to visit your servant." They replied, "Do as you say."
1:18:6:So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread."
1:18:7:Then Abraham ran to the herd, selected a choice, tender calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
1:18:8:He then took curds, milk, and the prepared calf, and set these before the men. He remained standing near them under the tree as they ate.
1:18:9:"Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he replied.
1:18:10:One of them said, "I will surely return to you around this time next year, and your wife Sarah will have a son." Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him.
1:18:11:Abraham and Sarah were already old, well advanced in years, and Sarah had stopped having her monthly cycles.
1:18:12:So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, "After I have become worn out and my husband is old, will I now experience pleasure?"
1:18:13:The Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?'
1:18:14:Is anything too difficult for the Lord? At the appointed time, I will return to you, around this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
1:18:15:Frightened, Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh." But He replied, "Yes, you did laugh."
1:18:16:When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
1:18:17:Then the Lord said, "Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
1:18:18:Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
1:18:19:For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."
1:18:20:Then the Lord said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grievous,
1:18:21:that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."
1:18:22:The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord.
1:18:23:Abraham approached Him and asked, "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
1:18:24:What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
1:18:25:Surely you would not do such a thing, to kill the righteous along with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Surely you will not. Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1:18:26:The Lord replied, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
1:18:27:Then Abraham spoke up again: "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
1:18:28:what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?" He answered, "If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it."
1:18:29:Once again Abraham asked, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."
1:18:30:Then Abraham said, "Please do not be angry, my Lord, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
1:18:31:Abraham continued, "Now that I have dared to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He replied, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."
1:18:32:Finally, Abraham said, "Please do not be angry, my Lord, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."
1:18:33:When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, He left, and Abraham returned home.
1:19:1:That evening, the two angels arrived in Sodom while Lot was sitting at the city gate. When he saw them, he got up to greet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
1:19:2:"My lords," said Lot, "please come to your servant's house for a night's stay and wash your feet. You can rise early and continue your journey." But they replied, "No, we will spend the night in the town square."
1:19:3:Lot insisted so strongly that they finally agreed to go with him to his house. He prepared a feast for them, baking unleavened bread, and they ate together.
1:19:4:Before they went to bed, all the men of the city, both young and old, surrounded the house.
1:19:5:They called out to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them intimately."
1:19:6:Lot stepped outside, closing the door behind him.
1:19:7:He pleaded with them, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.
1:19:8:Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do whatever you want with them. But please, don't do anything to these men, for they are under the protection of my roof."
1:19:9:The men of the city replied, "Stand back! This man came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge? We'll treat you worse than them!" They pressed hard against Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
1:19:10:But the angels reached out, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door.
1:19:11:Then they struck the men at the entrance of the house, both small and great, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
1:19:12:The angels asked Lot, "Do you have any other relatives here in the city? Bring out your sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else you have in the city,
1:19:13:because we are about to destroy this place. The outcry against its people has become so great before the Lord that He has sent us to destroy it."
1:19:14:So Lot went out and spoke to his future sons-in-law who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry, get out of this place, for the Lord is going to destroy the city!" But they thought he was joking.
1:19:15:As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."
1:19:16:When Lot hesitated, the angels grabbed his hand, along with the hands of his wife and two daughters, and led them safely out of the city, for the Lord had mercy on them.
1:19:17:Once outside, one of the angels ordered, "Run for your lives! Don't look back or stop anywhere in the plain. Flee to the mountains, or you'll be consumed!"
1:19:18:Lot replied, "No, my lords, please!
1:19:19:Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you've shown me great kindness by sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.
1:19:20:Look, there's a small town nearby where I can run for safety. It's only a small place, but it will save my life."
1:19:21:The angel said to him, "Very well, I will grant your request. I won't destroy the town you speak of.
1:19:22:But hurry! Flee there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you arrive." That is why the town was called Zoar.
1:19:23:As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar,
1:19:24:the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the heavens.
1:19:25:He overthrew those cities, along with the entire plain, destroying all the inhabitants and everything that grew on the ground.
1:19:26:But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
1:19:27:Early the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
1:19:28:He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and across the plain, seeing the smoke rising like the smoke from a furnace.
1:19:29:So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
1:19:30:Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. They lived in a cave together.
1:19:31:One day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there's no man around here to give us children, as is the custom all over the earth.
1:19:32:Let's get our father drunk with wine, and we will lie with him so that we can preserve our family line through our father."
1:19:33:That night they got their father drunk with wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with her father. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
1:19:34:The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him drunk again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so that we can preserve our family line through our father."
1:19:35:So they got their father drunk again that night, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again, he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
1:19:36:In this way, both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
1:19:37:The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.
1:19:38:The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
1:20:1:At that time, Abraham traveled from there to the land of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was living in Gerar,
1:20:2:Abraham told everyone that Sarah, his wife, was actually his sister. So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.
1:20:3:But God came to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman."
1:20:4:Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?
1:20:5:Didn't he himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I acted with a clear conscience and clean hands."
1:20:6:Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this with a pure heart, and I have also kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
1:20:7:Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you and all who belong to you will surely die."
1:20:8:Early the next morning, Abimelech called all his officials and told them everything that had happened in the dream. They were terrified.
1:20:9:Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and asked him, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done."
1:20:10:Abimelech also asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"
1:20:11:Abraham replied, "I thought, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
1:20:12:Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father but not of my mother; and she became my wife.
1:20:13:And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
1:20:14:Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him.
1:20:15:Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like."
1:20:16:To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
1:20:17:Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so they could have children again,
1:20:18:for the Lord had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah.
1:21:1:At the time appointed by God, Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age.
1:21:2:Abraham named his newborn son Isaac, just as God had instructed him.
1:21:3:When Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him according to God's command.
1:21:4:Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born.
1:21:5:Sarah declared, "God has brought me laughter; everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."
1:21:6:She also said, "Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given him a son in his old age."
1:21:7:The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned, Abraham held a great feast.
1:21:8:But Sarah saw Ishmael, the son of Abraham and her Egyptian servant Hagar, mocking Isaac.
1:21:9:So she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman will not share the inheritance with my son Isaac."
1:21:10:This distressed Abraham greatly because Ishmael was his son.
1:21:11:But God said to Abraham, "Don't be troubled about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to what Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be counted.
1:21:12:As for the son of the slave woman, I will make him into a nation too, because he is your offspring."
1:21:13:Early the next morning, Abraham took some bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He placed them on her shoulder, along with the boy, and sent her away. She went off and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
1:21:14:When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.
1:21:15:Then she went and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there, she began to cry.
1:21:16:God heard the boy's cries, and the angel of God called out to Hagar from heaven, saying, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
1:21:17:Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."
1:21:18:Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
1:21:19:God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert archer.
1:21:20:While living in the wilderness of Paran, his mother found a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
1:21:21:At that time, Abimelek and Phicol, the commander of his forces, said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.
1:21:22:Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the land where you are residing as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you."
1:21:23:Abraham replied, "I swear it."
1:21:24:However, Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek's servants had seized.
1:21:25:Abimelek said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today."
1:21:26:So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.
1:21:27:Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,
1:21:28:and Abimelek asked him, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"
1:21:29:Abraham answered, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well."
1:21:30:That place was called Beersheba because the two men swore an oath there.
1:21:31:After they had made the treaty at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol, the commander of his forces, returned to the land of the Philistines.
1:21:32:Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
1:21:33:And Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
1:22:1:Now, it happened that God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" He replied, "Here I am."
1:22:2:God continued, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will show you."
1:22:3:So early in the morning, Abraham got up, saddled his donkey, and took two of his servants with him, along with his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about.
1:22:4:On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
1:22:5:He told his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then return to you."
1:22:6:Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them walked together,
1:22:7:Isaac spoke up, saying, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. Isaac asked, "We have the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
1:22:8:Abraham answered, "God will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And they continued walking together.
1:22:9:When they reached the place God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.
1:22:10:Then, with the knife in hand, Abraham prepared to slay his son.
1:22:11:But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" He responded, "Here I am."
1:22:12:The angel said, "Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
1:22:13:Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. He went over, took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
1:22:14:So Abraham named that place "The Lord Will Provide," and it is still said today, "On the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided."
1:22:15:The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
1:22:16:saying, "I swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
1:22:17:I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,
1:22:18:and through your offspring, all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."
1:22:19:Afterward, Abraham returned to his servants, and together they set off for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
1:22:20:Later on, news came to Abraham: "Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:
1:22:21:Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
1:22:22:Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1:22:23:Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
1:22:24:His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
1:23:1:Sarah lived to be 127 years old; these were the years of Sarah's life.
1:23:2:She passed away in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham mourned and wept for her.
1:23:3:Afterwards, Abraham got up from beside his deceased wife and spoke to the Hittites, saying,
1:23:4:"I am a foreigner residing among you; please let me purchase a burial site from you so that I may bury my dead."
1:23:5:The Hittites replied to Abraham,
1:23:6:"Listen to us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb for burying your dead."
1:23:7:Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, the Hittites.
1:23:8:He said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf,
1:23:9:so that he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me at the full price as a burial site among you."
1:23:10:Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people, and he answered Abraham in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
1:23:11:"No, my lord," Ephron said, "hear me out. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of my people, I give it to you. Bury your dead."
1:23:12:Abraham bowed before the people of the land
1:23:13:and spoke to Ephron in their presence, saying, "If you will only please listen to me. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so that I can bury my dead there."
1:23:14:Ephron replied to Abraham,
1:23:15:"My lord, listen to me. The land is worth 400 shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Go ahead and bury your dead."
1:23:16:Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out the amount of silver specified by Ephron, which was 400 shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.
1:23:17:So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, as well as all the trees within the borders of the field—was legally transferred
1:23:18:to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.
1:23:19:After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
1:23:20:The field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
1:24:1:Abraham was now old and well along in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
1:24:2:He said to his oldest servant, who managed his household, "Place your hand under my thigh,
1:24:3:and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you won't take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live,
1:24:4:but instead, go to my country and my relatives to find a wife for my son Isaac."
1:24:5:The servant asked, "What if the woman isn't willing to follow me back to this land? Should I take your son back to the country you came from?"
1:24:6:Abraham replied, "Never take my son back there.
1:24:7:The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and my native land, who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.
1:24:8:If the woman is unwilling to come with you, then you'll be released from this oath. Just don't take my son back there."
1:24:9:So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath concerning this matter.
1:24:10:Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, carrying all kinds of valuable gifts from his master. He set out for the town of Nahor in Mesopotamia.
1:24:11:He made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town at evening time, when women went out to draw water.
1:24:12:He prayed, "LORD, God of my master Abraham, make this mission successful and show kindness to my master Abraham.
1:24:13:Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
1:24:14:May it be that when I say to a young woman, 'Please let down your jar so I may have a drink,' and she replies, 'Drink, and I'll also water your camels,' that she is the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this, I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
1:24:15:Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.
1:24:16:The young woman was very beautiful and a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again.
1:24:17:The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."
1:24:18:"Drink, my lord," she replied, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
1:24:19:After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too until they've had enough to drink."
1:24:20:So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
1:24:21:Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
1:24:22:When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
1:24:23:Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
1:24:24:She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor."
1:24:25:And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."
1:24:26:Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
1:24:27:saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."
1:24:28:The young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
1:24:29:Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
1:24:30:When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard Rebekah tell what the man had said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
1:24:31:"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," Laban said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
1:24:32:So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
1:24:33:Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," Laban replied.
1:24:34:He said, "I am Abraham's servant.
1:24:35:The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
1:24:36:My master's wife Sarah bore a son to him in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.
1:24:37:My master made me swear an oath, saying, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
1:24:38:but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'
1:24:39:"I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?'
1:24:40:He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family.
1:24:41:Then, when you go to my clan, you'll be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you—you will be released from my oath.'
1:24:42:"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.
1:24:43:See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar,"
1:24:44:and she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.'
1:24:45:"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
1:24:46:"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
1:24:47:I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,
1:24:48:and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.
1:24:49:Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."
1:24:50:Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
1:24:51:Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed."
1:24:52:When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
1:24:53:Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
1:24:54:After this, he and his men ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."
1:24:55:But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the young woman stay with us ten days or so; then you may go."
1:24:56:But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master."
1:24:57:They said, "Let's call the young woman and ask her about it."
1:24:58:So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" She replied, "I will go."
1:24:59:So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.
1:24:60:And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies."
1:24:61:Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
1:24:62:Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
1:24:63:He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.
1:24:64:Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
1:24:65:and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
1:24:66:Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
1:24:67:Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. She became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
1:25:1:Abraham married another woman named Keturah after Sarah's death.
1:25:2:She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah for him.
1:25:3:Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
1:25:4:The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah's descendants.
1:25:5:Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
1:25:6:But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from his son Isaac while he was still alive, to the east, into the eastern countries.
1:25:7:Abraham lived for 175 years in total.
1:25:8:He breathed his last and died at a good old age, content and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
1:25:9:Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field that belonged to Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite.
1:25:10:The field and the cave in it had been bought by Abraham from the Hittites as a burial site.
1:25:11:After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac, who settled near Beer Lahai Roi.
1:25:12:This is the lineage of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to him.
1:25:13:Ishmael's sons, listed by their names, were Nebaioth, the firstborn, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
1:25:14:Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
1:25:15:Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
1:25:16:These were Ishmael's sons, and these were their names by their settlements and encampments—twelve tribal chiefs according to their tribes.
1:25:17:Ishmael lived for 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
1:25:18:His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. They lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
1:25:19:This is the account of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham fathered Isaac.
1:25:20:Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
1:25:21:Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant.
1:25:22:The children struggled within her, so she asked, "Why is this happening to me?" She went to inquire of the Lord.
1:25:23:The Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."
1:25:24:When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
1:25:25:The first one came out red and covered with hair like a fur coat, so they named him Esau.
1:25:26:After that, his brother was born with his hand grasping Esau's heel, so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
1:25:27:The boys grew up. Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed among the tents.
1:25:28:Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating the game Esau brought, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
1:25:29:One day, when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.
1:25:30:He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm starving!" (That's why he was also called Edom.)
1:25:31:Jacob replied, "First, sell me your birthright."
1:25:32:"Look, I'm about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"
1:25:33:Jacob insisted, "Swear to me first." So Esau swore an oath and sold his birthright to Jacob.
1:25:34:Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. In this way, Esau despised his birthright.
1:26:1:Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that occurred during Abraham's time. So Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar.
1:26:2:The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, "Don't go down to Egypt; live in the land I will show you.
1:26:3:Stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your descendants, fulfilling the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
1:26:4:I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. Through your descendants, all nations on earth will be blessed,
1:26:5:because Abraham listened to my voice and obeyed my commandments, my requirements, my rules, and my instructions."
1:26:6:So Isaac settled in Gerar.
1:26:7:When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful."
1:26:8:After some time had passed, King Abimelech of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah, his wife.
1:26:9:Abimelech called Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied, "I thought I might die because of her."
1:26:10:Abimelech said, "What have you done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
1:26:11:So Abimelech ordered all the people, saying, "Anyone who harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death."
1:26:12:Isaac planted crops in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundredfold because the Lord blessed him.
1:26:13:The man became rich and continued to prosper until he became very wealthy.
1:26:14:He had many flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, as well as a large household. The Philistines envied him.
1:26:15:Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells that his father's servants had dug during the time of his father Abraham, filling them with dirt.
1:26:16:Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave us, for you have become much more powerful than we are."
1:26:17:So Isaac left there and camped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.
1:26:18:Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. He gave them the same names his father had given them.
1:26:19:When Isaac's servants dug in the valley, they discovered a well of fresh water.
1:26:20:But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming, "The water is ours!" So Isaac named the well Esek, which means "dispute."
1:26:21:Then they dug another well, but they also quarreled over it. So Isaac named it Sitnah, which means "opposition."
1:26:22:He moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he named it Rehoboth, which means "open space," and said, "Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
1:26:23:From there, Isaac went up to Beersheba.
1:26:24:That night, the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your offspring because of my servant Abraham."
1:26:25:So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. He pitched his tent, and his servants dug a well.
1:26:26:Meanwhile, Abimelech came to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
1:26:27:Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?"
1:26:28:They replied, "We saw clearly that the Lord was with you, so
1:26:29:we thought, 'Let there be a sworn agreement between us, between you and us. Let's make a covenant with you
1:26:30:that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. You are now the blessed of the Lord.'"
1:26:31:Isaac then prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
1:26:32:Early the next morning, they swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
1:26:33:On that very day, Isaac's servants came and informed him about the well they had dug. They said, "We have found water!"
1:26:34:Isaac named the well Shibah, which means "oath," and to this day the name of the town is Beersheba, which means "well of the oath."
1:27:1:One day, when Isaac was old and his eyesight had weakened, he called for Esau, his older son, and said, "My son, I am old now, and I don't know when I will die.
1:27:2:So, take your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out to the field to hunt some game for me.
1:27:3:Then prepare a tasty meal that I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die."
1:27:4:Rebekah overheard what Isaac said to his son Esau. So when Esau went out to hunt for game to bring back,
1:27:5:Rebekah spoke to her son Jacob, saying, "I heard your father tell your brother Esau,
1:27:6:'Bring me game and prepare a delicious meal for me to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.'
1:27:7:Now, my son, listen carefully and do exactly as I instruct you.
1:27:8:Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, and I will prepare them into a delicious meal for your father, just the way he likes it.
1:27:9:You shall take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies."
1:27:10:But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I have smooth skin.
1:27:11:What if my father touches me? He would think I'm trying to trick him and would curse me instead of blessing me."
1:27:12:His mother replied, "Let any curse fall on me, my son. Just do as I say, and go get the goats for me."
1:27:13:So Jacob brought the goats to his mother, and she prepared a delicious meal just the way his father liked it.
1:27:14:Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.
1:27:15:She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goat skins.
1:27:16:Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty meal and the bread she had made.
1:27:17:He went to his father and said, "My father." Isaac replied, "Yes, my son. Who is it, Esau or Jacob?"
1:27:18:Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me."
1:27:19:Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "The Lord your God gave me success."
1:27:20:Isaac then said to Jacob, "Come closer so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."
1:27:21:Jacob approached his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
1:27:22:He didn't recognize Jacob because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
1:27:23:Then Isaac asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he replied, "I am."
1:27:24:So Isaac said, "Bring the food to me, and I will eat some of my son's game so that I may bless you." Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank.
1:27:25:Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me."
1:27:26:So Jacob went to him and kissed him. When Isaac smelled the clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.
1:27:27:May God give you heaven's dew and earth's richness—an abundance of grain and new wine.
1:27:28:May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed."
1:27:29:After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had barely left his father's presence, his brother Esau returned from hunting.
1:27:30:He too prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, "My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me."
1:27:31:But Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
1:27:32:Isaac trembled violently and said, "Then who was it that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came, and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!"
1:27:33:When Esau heard his father's words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said, "Bless me—me too, my father!"
1:27:34:But Isaac replied, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
1:27:35:Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?"
1:27:36:Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have given him all his relatives as his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?"
1:27:37:Esau pleaded with his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.
1:27:38:His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above.
1:27:39:You will live by the sword and serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."
1:27:40:Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
1:27:41:When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.
1:27:42:Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
1:27:43:Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides.
1:27:44:When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
1:27:45:Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living."
1:28:1:Now Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him, instructing him not to marry a Canaanite woman.
1:28:2:Instead, he told him, "Go to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother's father, Bethuel, and find yourself a wife among the daughters of your mother's brother, Laban.
1:28:3:May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and multiply you so that you become an assembly of nations.
1:28:4:And may He grant you the blessing of Abraham, to you and your descendants, so that you may possess the land where you are now living as a foreigner—the land that God gave to Abraham."
1:28:5:So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
1:28:6:Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife there, and that when he blessed him, he commanded him not to marry a Canaanite woman.
1:28:7:Jacob obeyed his father and mother and went to Paddan-aram.
1:28:8:Seeing that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,
1:28:9:Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, in addition to the wives he already had.
1:28:10:As Jacob set out from Beersheba and traveled toward Haran,
1:28:11:he came upon a certain place and decided to spend the night there because the sun had set. He took a stone from the place, put it under his head, and lay down to sleep.
1:28:12:In a dream, he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and God's angels were ascending and descending on it.
1:28:13:There above it stood the LORD, who said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
1:28:14:Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, spreading out in all directions—to the west, east, north, and south. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
1:28:15:I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
1:28:16:When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware."
1:28:17:He was filled with awe and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven."
1:28:18:Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.
1:28:19:He named that place Bethel, though the city was originally called Luz.
1:28:20:Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey I am taking, providing me with food to eat and clothes to wear,
1:28:21:and if I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God.
1:28:22:This stone I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me, I will surely give a tenth back to you."
1:29:1:Jacob continued on his journey and arrived at the land of the eastern peoples.
1:29:2:He saw a well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying nearby because they were watered from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well.
1:29:3:The shepherds would gather all the flocks there, roll the stone away from the well's opening, and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place over the well's mouth.
1:29:4:Jacob asked the shepherds, "My brothers, where are you from?" They replied, "We are from Haran."
1:29:5:He said to them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" They answered, "Yes, we know him."
1:29:6:Then Jacob asked, "Is he well?" They said, "He is well; and look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."
1:29:7:Jacob told them, "It is still broad daylight; it's not yet time to gather the animals. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture."
1:29:8:But they replied, "We cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the well's mouth. Only then can we water the sheep."
1:29:9:While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
1:29:10:When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over, rolled the stone away from the well's mouth, and watered his uncle's sheep.
1:29:11:Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
1:29:12:He told her that he was a relative of her father and Rebekah's son. So she ran to tell her father.
1:29:13:Upon hearing the news about his sister's son Jacob, Laban hurried to meet him. He embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his home. Jacob told Laban everything that had happened,
1:29:14:and Laban said to him, "You are indeed my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him for a month,
1:29:15:Laban said to him, "Just because you're my relative doesn't mean you should work for me without pay. Tell me, what should your wages be?"
1:29:16:Now Laban had two daughters; the older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel.
1:29:17:Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
1:29:18:Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will work for you seven years in exchange for your younger daughter Rachel."
1:29:19:Laban agreed, saying, "It is better for me to give her to you than to another man. Stay here with me."
1:29:20:So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
1:29:21:Finally, Jacob said to Laban, "The time has come; give me my wife so I may sleep with her."
1:29:22:Laban gathered all the people of the place and held a feast.
1:29:23:But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, who slept with her.
1:29:24:Laban also gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.
1:29:25:When morning arrived, Jacob realized it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What have you done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?"
1:29:26:Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
1:29:27:Finish this week of celebration with Leah, and then we will also give you Rachel if you agree to serve me another seven years."
1:29:28:Jacob agreed, and after he had completed the week with Leah, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
1:29:29:Laban also gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
1:29:30:Jacob slept with Rachel, and he loved her more than Leah. He continued to work for Laban for another seven years.
1:30:1:Now when Rachel saw that she wasn't bearing any children for Jacob, she became jealous of her sister Leah. So she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I will die."
1:30:2:Jacob was upset with Rachel and replied, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
1:30:3:Rachel then said, "Here is my servant Bilhah; sleep with her so that she can bear children on my behalf, and through her, I too can have a family."
1:30:4:So Rachel gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.
1:30:5:Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
1:30:6:Rachel declared, "God has judged me and has also heard my voice, giving me a son." Therefore she named him Dan.
1:30:7:Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
1:30:8:Rachel exclaimed, "I have wrestled mightily with my sister and have prevailed." So she named him Naphtali.
1:30:9:When Leah realized she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
1:30:10:Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
1:30:11:Leah announced, "Good fortune has come!" So she named him Gad.
1:30:12:Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
1:30:13:Leah declared, "How happy I am! Women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
1:30:14:During the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
1:30:15:Leah responded, "Is it not enough that you have taken my husband? Now you want to take my son's mandrakes too?" Rachel replied, "Very well, he can sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
1:30:16:When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come to me, because I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So Jacob slept with her that night.
1:30:17:God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
1:30:18:Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
1:30:19:Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
1:30:20:Leah declared, "God has given me a good gift; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
1:30:21:Later, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
1:30:22:Then God remembered Rachel, listened to her, and enabled her to conceive.
1:30:23:Rachel became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, "God has taken away my disgrace."
1:30:24:She named him Joseph, saying, "May the Lord add another son to me."
1:30:25:After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland.
1:30:26:Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the work I have done for you."
1:30:27:Laban replied, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you."
1:30:28:He continued, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."
1:30:29:Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
1:30:30:The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I provide for my own household?"
1:30:31:Laban asked, "What shall I give you?" Jacob replied, "Do not give me anything. But if you do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:
1:30:32:Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.
1:30:33:And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen."
1:30:34:Laban agreed, saying, "Let it be as you have said."
1:30:35:That same day Laban removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and placed them in the care of his sons.
1:30:36:Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.
1:30:37:Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
1:30:38:He set the peeled branches in the watering troughs so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
1:30:39:they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled.
1:30:40:Jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked and all the dark-colored animals in Laban's flock. He set apart his own herds and did not mix them with Laban's animals.
1:30:41:Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches.
1:30:42:But if the animals were weak, he would not place the branches there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.
1:30:43:In this way, Jacob grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, as well as male and female servants, camels, and donkeys.
1:31:1:Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and gained all his wealth at our father's expense."
1:31:2:Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him had changed and was not as friendly as before.
1:31:3:Then the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
1:31:4:Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come out to the field where his flocks were.
1:31:5:He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me.
1:31:6:You know that I have worked hard for your father,
1:31:7:but he has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
1:31:8:If Laban said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flock gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked offspring.
1:31:9:So God has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me.
1:31:10:Once during breeding season, I had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.
1:31:11:The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.'
1:31:12:And he said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
1:31:13:I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'"
1:31:14:Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?
1:31:15:He has treated us as foreigners, selling us and using up what was paid for us.
1:31:16:Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."
1:31:17:Then Jacob put his children and wives on camels,
1:31:18:and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to return to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
1:31:19:When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.
1:31:20:Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.
1:31:21:So he fled with everything he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
1:31:22:On the third day, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
1:31:23:Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
1:31:24:But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and warned him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
1:31:25:Laban overtook Jacob, who had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.
1:31:26:Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me and taken my daughters away like captives in war!
1:31:27:Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?
1:31:28:You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and daughters goodbye. You have acted foolishly!
1:31:29:I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
1:31:30:Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's household. But why did you steal my gods?"
1:31:31:Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
1:31:32:But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
1:31:33:So Laban went into Jacob's tent and then into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.
1:31:34:Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
1:31:35:Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.
1:31:36:Jacob became angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?
1:31:37:Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
1:31:38:I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
1:31:39:I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
1:31:40:This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
1:31:41:It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.
1:31:42:If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."
1:31:43:Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or about the children they have borne?
1:31:44:Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."
1:31:45:So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
1:31:46:He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
1:31:47:Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
1:31:48:Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.
1:31:49:It was also called Mizpah because he said, "May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
1:31:50:If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."
1:31:51:Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
1:31:52:This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
1:31:53:May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
1:31:54:He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
1:31:55:Early the next morning, Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
1:32:1:During that time, Jacob went on his way and encountered angels of God.
1:32:2:When he saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim.
1:32:3:Then Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
1:32:4:He instructed them, "Say this to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now.
1:32:5:I own cattle, donkeys, flocks, male and female servants. I am sending this message to inform my lord, so that I may find favor in your eyes.'"
1:32:6:The messengers returned to Jacob and reported, "We went to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, along with four hundred men."
1:32:7:Greatly afraid and distressed, Jacob divided the people with him, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels, into two camps.
1:32:8:He thought, "If Esau attacks one camp, the other camp will escape."
1:32:9:Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Lord who told me, 'Return to your country and your family, and I will make you prosper,'
1:32:10:I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
1:32:11:Please save me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, along with the mothers and their children.
1:32:12:But You have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which is too numerous to count.'"
1:32:13:After spending the night there, Jacob selected a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him:
1:32:14:two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
1:32:15:thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
1:32:16:He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, "Go ahead of me, and keep some distance between each herd."
1:32:17:He instructed the one in front, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Whose servant are you? Where are you going? And whose animals are these?'
1:32:18:You shall reply, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and Jacob himself is coming behind us.'"
1:32:19:Jacob gave similar instructions to the second, third, and all the others who followed the herds, saying, "You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
1:32:20:And be sure to add, 'Your servant Jacob is right behind us.'" For he thought, "I will appease Esau with the gifts that go before me. After that, I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me."
1:32:21:So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, while he spent the night in the camp.
1:32:22:During the night, Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
1:32:23:After taking them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
1:32:24:Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
1:32:25:When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip, so that his hip was wrenched as they wrestled.
1:32:26:The man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
1:32:27:The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
1:32:28:Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have prevailed."
1:32:29:Jacob requested, "Please tell me your name." But the man replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed Jacob there.
1:32:30:So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared."
1:32:31:The sun rose as Jacob passed Peniel, limping because of his hip.
1:32:32:To this day, the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.
1:33:1:Later, Jacob looked up and saw Esau approaching with 400 men. He divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
1:33:2:He placed the maidservants and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
1:33:3:Jacob himself went ahead of them, bowing down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
1:33:4:Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
1:33:5:When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, "Who are these with you?" Jacob replied, "These are the children God has graciously given your servant."
1:33:6:Then the maidservants and their children came forward and bowed down.
1:33:7:Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, followed by Rachel and Joseph, who did the same.
1:33:8:Esau asked, "What was the meaning of all those flocks and herds I encountered?" Jacob answered, "To find favor in your eyes, my lord."
1:33:9:But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; keep what you have for yourself."
1:33:10:Jacob insisted, "No, please! If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For seeing your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.
1:33:11:Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob urged him, Esau accepted it.
1:33:12:Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I will accompany you."
1:33:13:But Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.
1:33:14:Please let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."
1:33:15:Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." But Jacob asked, "Why do that? Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."
1:33:16:So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
1:33:17:Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.
1:33:18:After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.
1:33:19:For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, the plot of land where he pitched his tent.
1:33:20:There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
1:34:1:One day, Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the local women.
1:34:2:Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite and ruler of the region, saw her and took her, forcing himself upon her.
1:34:3:He became deeply attracted to Dinah, Jacob's daughter, and fell in love with her. He spoke tenderly to her.
1:34:4:Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife."
1:34:5:Jacob learned that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were out in the field with the livestock, he remained silent until they returned.
1:34:6:Hamor, Shechem's father, came to speak with Jacob.
1:34:7:When Jacob's sons heard the news, they returned from the field. They were furious and deeply distressed because Shechem had committed an outrageous act against Israel by sleeping with Jacob's daughter – something that should not be done.
1:34:8:Hamor discussed the matter with them, saying, "My son Shechem is deeply in love with your daughter. Please let him marry her.
1:34:9:Intermarry with us; give us your daughters as wives and take our daughters for yourselves.
1:34:10:You can settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, trade freely, and acquire property in it."
1:34:11:Then Shechem addressed Dinah's father and brothers, saying, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.
1:34:12:Set the bride price and gift as high as you want, and I'll pay whatever you ask. Just let me marry the girl."
1:34:13:Jacob's sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father Hamor because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah.
1:34:14:They said to them, "We cannot do this; we cannot give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
1:34:15:We will only agree on one condition: if you become like us by having every male among you circumcised.
1:34:16:Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people.
1:34:17:But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we will take our sister and leave."
1:34:18:Hamor and his son Shechem agreed to the proposal.
1:34:19:Shechem wasted no time in doing what was requested because he was deeply in love with Jacob's daughter. He was the most respected member of his father's household.
1:34:20:Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate to discuss the matter with the men of their city.
1:34:21:They said, "These people are friendly toward us. Let them live in our land and trade freely. The land is large enough for them. We can marry their daughters and give them our daughters as wives.
1:34:22:But there is one condition they insist upon: that every male among us be circumcised, just as they are circumcised.
1:34:23:Won't their livestock, property, and all their animals become ours? So let's agree to their terms, and they will settle among us."
1:34:24:All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.
1:34:25:Three days later, when the men were still in pain from the circumcision, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.
1:34:26:They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.
1:34:27:Jacob's other sons came upon the slain and plundered the city because their sister had been defiled.
1:34:28:They seized their flocks, herds, donkeys, and everything else in the city and in the fields.
1:34:29:They took all their wealth, their children, and their wives, capturing everything in the houses.
1:34:30:Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me repulsive to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack, I will be destroyed, along with my household."
1:34:31:But Simeon and Levi replied, "Should our sister be treated like a prostitute?"
1:35:1:God said to Jacob, "Arise and go up to Bethel, and stay there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
1:35:2:Jacob told his household and all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods among you, purify yourselves, and change your clothes.
1:35:3:We will go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to the God who answered me in my time of distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."
1:35:4:So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had, along with their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.
1:35:5:As they set out, a great fear fell upon the towns around them, so that no one pursued them.
1:35:6:Jacob and all the people with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
1:35:7:There he built an altar, and he called the place El-Bethel, because it was there that God revealed Himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
1:35:8:Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon-Bacuth.
1:35:9:After Jacob returned from Paddan-Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.
1:35:10:God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel." So He named him Israel.
1:35:11:God also said to him, "I am God Almighty; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants.
1:35:12:The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you."
1:35:13:Then God left him at the place where He had spoken with him.
1:35:14:Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.
1:35:15:Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
1:35:16:They moved on from Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.
1:35:17:As she was having intense labor pains, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you have another son."
1:35:18:In her last breath—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.
1:35:19:Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
1:35:20:Over her grave, Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb.
1:35:21:Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-Eder.
1:35:22:While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it.
1:35:23:Jacob had twelve sons: The sons of Leah were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
1:35:24:The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
1:35:25:The sons of Rachel's servant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
1:35:26:The sons of Leah's servant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, born to him in Paddan-Aram.
1:35:27:Jacob went home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath-Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
1:35:28:Isaac lived 180 years.
1:35:29:Then he breathed his last and died at a ripe old age, joining his people. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
1:36:1:This is the account of Esau (also known as Edom) and his descendants.
1:36:2:Esau married women from Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
1:36:3:and Basemath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
1:36:4:Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,
1:36:5:and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
1:36:6:Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the people in his household, his livestock, all his animals, and all the possessions he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land away from his brother Jacob.
1:36:7:Their possessions were too great for them to live together, and the land where they stayed could not support them because of their livestock.
1:36:8:So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. (Esau is Edom.)
1:36:9:Here is the record of Esau's family line in the hill country of Seir, the father of the Edomites:
1:36:10:These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, son of Esau's wife Basemath.
1:36:11:The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
1:36:12:Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the descendants of Adah, Esau's wife.
1:36:13:These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They were the descendants of Basemath, Esau's wife.
1:36:14:These were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: She bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah to Esau.
1:36:15:These are the chiefs among Esau's descendants. The sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
1:36:16:Gatam, and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were the grandsons of Adah.
1:36:17:The sons of Reuel, Esau's son: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were the grandsons of Esau's wife Basemath.
1:36:18:These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah.
1:36:19:These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs.
1:36:20:These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who lived in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
1:36:21:Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in Edom.
1:36:22:The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
1:36:23:The sons of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
1:36:24:These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
1:36:25:The children of Anah were Dishon and Oholibamah, daughter of Anah.
1:36:26:The sons of Dishon were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
1:36:27:The sons of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
1:36:28:The sons of Dishan were Uz and Aran.
1:36:29:These are the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
1:36:30:Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
1:36:31:These are the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king ruled:
1:36:32:Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
1:36:33:When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
1:36:34:After Jobab's death, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king.
1:36:35:When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith.
1:36:36:After Hadad's death, Samlah from Masrekah became king.
1:36:37:When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king.
1:36:38:After Shaul's death, Baal-Hanan son of Achbor became king.
1:36:39:When Baal-Hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar became king. His city was named Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-Zahab.
1:36:40:These are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families and regions, by their names: Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
1:36:41:Aholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
1:36:42:Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
1:36:43:Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites.
1:37:1:Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
1:37:2:This is the account of Jacob's family. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. He brought their father a bad report about them.
1:37:3:Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons because he was the son born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him.
1:37:4:When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
1:37:5:Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
1:37:6:He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:
1:37:7:We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."
1:37:8:His brothers replied, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
1:37:9:Then Joseph had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
1:37:10:When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"
1:37:11:His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
1:37:12:Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem.
1:37:13:And Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.
1:37:14:So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,
1:37:15:a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
1:37:16:He replied, "I'm searching for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"
1:37:17:"They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
1:37:18:But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
1:37:19:"Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.
1:37:20:"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what becomes of his dreams."
1:37:21:When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.
1:37:22:"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
1:37:23:So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the richly ornamented robe he was wearing—
1:37:24:and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
1:37:25:As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
1:37:26:Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
1:37:27:Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.
1:37:28:So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
1:37:29:When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
1:37:30:He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"
1:37:31:Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
1:37:32:They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."
1:37:33:He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! A ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."
1:37:34:Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
1:37:35:All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave." So his father wept for him.
1:37:36:Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potipar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
1:38:1:At that time, Judah left his brothers and stayed with a man from Adullam named Hirah.
1:38:2:There, Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and he married her and slept with her.
1:38:3:She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom she named Er.
1:38:4:Later, she got pregnant again and had another son, whom she named Onan.
1:38:5:She gave birth to a third son and named him Shelah. He was born in Kezib when she gave birth to him.
1:38:6:Judah found a wife for his firstborn, Er, and her name was Tamar.
1:38:7:However, Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord took his life.
1:38:8:Then Judah said to Onan, "Go sleep with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother."
1:38:9:But Onan knew that the offspring wouldn't be his, so whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother.
1:38:10:This displeased the Lord, so he took Onan's life as well.
1:38:11:Judah then told his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's household until my son Shelah grows up." He thought, "He might die too, like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
1:38:12:After a long time, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, passed away. When Judah had finished mourning, he went up to Timnah with his friend Hirah the Adullamite to shear his sheep.
1:38:13:Tamar was informed that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
1:38:14:So she removed her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She did this because she saw that Shelah had grown up, but she hadn't been given to him as a wife.
1:38:15:When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.
1:38:16:Not realizing she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you." She asked, "What will you give me to sleep with you?"
1:38:17:He replied, "I'll send you a young goat from my flock." She said, "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?"
1:38:18:Judah asked, "What should I give you as a pledge?" Tamar answered, "Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand." So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
1:38:19:Afterward, she left, took off her veil, and put on her widow's garments again.
1:38:20:Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to retrieve his pledge from the woman, but he couldn't find her.
1:38:21:He asked the men of that place, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" They answered, "There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here."
1:38:22:So he returned to Judah and said, "I couldn't find her. The men of the place also said there's no shrine prostitute there."
1:38:23:Judah replied, "Let her keep the items, or we'll become a laughingstock. I did send her this young goat, but you couldn't find her."
1:38:24:About three months later, Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has acted like a prostitute, and now she's pregnant." Judah ordered, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"
1:38:25:As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law, "I am pregnant by the man who owns these items. Examine them: whose seal and cord and staff are these?"
1:38:26:Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I since I didn't give her to my son Shelah." He did not sleep with her again.
1:38:27:When it was time for Tamar to give birth, it turned out she had twins in her womb.
1:38:28:As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist, saying, "This one came out first."
1:38:29:But then he withdrew his hand, and his brother came out. She said, "You have broken through! How did you manage to break out?" So he was named Perez.
1:38:30:Afterward, his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out, and he was named Zerah.
1:39:1:Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt, and an Egyptian named Potipar, one of Pharaoh's officials and the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.
1:39:2:The Lord was with Joseph, so he prospered and lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
1:39:3:Potipar noticed that the Lord was with Joseph and that the Lord made everything Joseph did successful.
1:39:4:Joseph gained favor in Potipar's eyes and became his personal attendant. Potipar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with everything he owned.
1:39:5:From the time Potipar appointed Joseph over his house and possessions, the Lord blessed the Egyptian's household because of Joseph. The Lord's blessing extended to all that Potipar had, both in his house and in his fields.
1:39:6:Potipar left everything he had in Joseph's care; he didn't concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.
1:39:7:After a while, Potipar's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."
1:39:8:But Joseph refused and told her, "My master has entrusted me with everything in his house and has given me authority over all he owns.
1:39:9:He hasn't withheld anything from me except you, since you are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"
1:39:10:Although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to sleep with her or even be near her.
1:39:11:One day, when Joseph entered the house to do his work and none of the household servants were inside,
1:39:12:Potipar's wife grabbed him by his cloak and said, "Sleep with me." But Joseph left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
1:39:13:When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run outside,
1:39:14:she called her household servants and told them, "Look, this Hebrew has been brought to us to make a mockery of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
1:39:15:When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
1:39:16:She kept his cloak with her until Potipar came home.
1:39:17:Then she told him the same story, saying, "This Hebrew slave you brought to us tried to come in and make a mockery of me.
1:39:18:But when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
1:39:19:When Potipar heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he became furious.
1:39:20:Potipar took Joseph and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But even while he was there,
1:39:21:the Lord was with Joseph and showed him kindness, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
1:39:22:The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners and gave him responsibility for everything that happened in the prison.
1:39:23:The warden didn't worry about anything under Joseph's care, because the Lord was with Joseph and made everything he did successful.
1:40:1:Sometime later, the cupbearer and the baker of Egypt's king offended their lord, the king of Egypt.
1:40:2:Pharaoh became angry with these two officers, his chief cupbearer and his chief baker.
1:40:3:So he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
1:40:4:The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to serve them, and they stayed in custody for some time.
1:40:5:One night, both the cupbearer and the baker had dreams, each with its own meaning.
1:40:6:When Joseph came to them the next morning, he noticed that they were troubled.
1:40:7:He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody, "Why do you look so sad today?"
1:40:8:They replied, "We both had dreams, but there's no one to interpret them." Joseph said, "Interpretations belong to God. Please tell me your dreams."
1:40:9:So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: "In my dream, I saw a vine before me,
1:40:10:with three branches on it. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
1:40:11:Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in his hand."
1:40:12:Joseph said, "This is the interpretation: The three branches represent three days.
1:40:13:In three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
1:40:14:But when all goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, so that he might get me out of this prison.
1:40:15:For I was forcibly taken from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in this dungeon."
1:40:16:When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said, "I also had a dream. There were three baskets of bread on my head,
1:40:17:and in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh. But the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
1:40:18:Joseph replied, "This is the interpretation: The three baskets represent three days.
1:40:19:In three days, Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. The birds will eat your flesh."
1:40:20:On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he held a feast for all his officials. He remembered the chief cupbearer and the chief baker among his guests.
1:40:21:He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and once again he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
1:40:22:But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had predicted.
1:40:23:Sadly, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him.
1:41:1:At the end of two years, Pharaoh had a dream. He was standing by the Nile River,
1:41:2:and he saw seven beautiful, healthy cows coming up from the river and grazing in the marshland.
1:41:3:Then, seven other cows emerged from the river, ugly and thin, and stood beside the healthy cows on the riverbank.
1:41:4:The ugly, thin cows devoured the seven healthy, plump cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
1:41:5:He fell asleep again and had a second dream. He saw seven full, ripe ears of grain growing on a single stalk.
1:41:6:Next, seven thin, withered ears of grain sprouted, scorched by the east wind.
1:41:7:The thin ears swallowed up the seven full, ripe ears. Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream.
1:41:8:In the morning, Pharaoh was troubled by his dreams, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. He told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
1:41:9:Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, remembering his own experience, "I am reminded today of my shortcomings.
1:41:10:Pharaoh was angry with his servants and imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
1:41:11:We both had dreams on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.
1:41:12:A young Hebrew man was with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
1:41:13:Everything happened just as he predicted: I was restored to my position, and the chief baker was executed."
1:41:14:Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
1:41:15:Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I've heard that when you hear a dream, you can explain it."
1:41:16:Joseph replied, "It's not me; God will provide the answer that will bring peace to Pharaoh."
1:41:17:Pharaoh described his dreams to Joseph, saying, "In my dream, I stood on the bank of the Nile,
1:41:18:and I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river and graze in the marshland.
1:41:19:Then, seven other cows emerged, weak and very ugly, the worst I've ever seen in Egypt.
1:41:20:The thin, ugly cows devoured the first seven fat cows.
1:41:21:But after they ate them, they didn't look any healthier; they were still as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
1:41:22:I also saw in my second dream, seven full, ripe ears of grain growing on a single stalk.
1:41:23:Then, seven withered, thin ears sprouted, scorched by the east wind.
1:41:24:The thin ears swallowed up the seven ripe ears. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."
1:41:25:Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Both dreams have the same meaning. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
1:41:26:The seven healthy cows and the seven full ears of grain represent seven years of abundance.
1:41:27:The seven thin, ugly cows and the seven withered ears of grain represent seven years of famine that will follow.
1:41:28:This is what God has planned, and He will soon bring it to pass.
1:41:29:Pharaoh should look for a wise and discerning man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
1:41:30:Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest during the seven years of abundance.
1:41:31:They should collect all the food produced in these good years and store it under Pharaoh's authority, to be kept in the cities for later use.
1:41:32:This food will serve as a reserve for the country during the seven years of famine, so that the people won't starve."
1:41:33:Pharaoh and his officials found Joseph's proposal to be wise.
1:41:34:Pharaoh said to his officials, "Can we find anyone like this man, who has the spirit of God within him?"
1:41:35:Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.
1:41:36:You will be in charge of my palace, and all my people will submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."
1:41:37:Pharaoh continued, "I hereby place you in charge of the entire land of Egypt."
1:41:38:He took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph's finger, dressed him in fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
1:41:39:Pharaoh had Joseph ride in his second chariot, and people shouted before him, "Make way!" So he was appointed over all the land of Egypt.
1:41:40:Pharaoh declared to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word, no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
1:41:41:Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
1:41:42:Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He traveled throughout Egypt,
1:41:43:gathering the abundance of the land during the seven years of plenty.
1:41:44:He stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea, so much that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.
1:41:45:Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1:41:46:Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh, saying, "God has made me forget all my troubles and my father's household."
1:41:47:The second son he named Ephraim, saying, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1:41:48:When the seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,
1:41:49:the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. There was famine in all the other lands, but throughout Egypt, there was food.
1:41:50:When the whole land of Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, and he told them, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."
1:41:51:As the famine spread over the entire region, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe.
1:41:52:All the countries around Egypt came to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe everywhere.
1:42:1: Now when Jacob found out that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why are you just staring at each other?
1:42:2: I've heard that there's grain for sale in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so we can survive and not starve to death."
1:42:3: So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
1:42:4: But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
1:42:5: The sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had spread to the land of Canaan.
1:42:6: Joseph was the governor of the land, responsible for selling grain to all its people. When his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
1:42:7: As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where have you come from?" he asked. They replied, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
1:42:8: Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn't recognize him.
1:42:9: Remembering the dreams he'd had about them, Joseph said, "You're spies! You've come to see where our land is unprotected."
1:42:10: "No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have only come to buy food.
1:42:11: We're all sons of one man. We're honest men, not spies."
1:42:12: But Joseph insisted, "No, you've come to see where our land is exposed."
1:42:13: They replied, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no longer living."
1:42:14: Joseph said to them, "It's just as I told you: You're spies!
1:42:15: Here's how you'll be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you won't leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
1:42:16: Send one of you to get your brother, while the rest of you will be kept in prison. This way, your words can be tested to see if you're telling the truth. If not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"
1:42:17: Then he put them all together in custody for three days.
1:42:18: On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you'll live, for I fear God:
1:42:19: If you're honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back to your starving households.
1:42:20: But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and you won't die." They agreed to this.
1:42:21: They said to one another, "We're being punished because of what we did to our brother. We saw his deep distress when he pleaded with us, but we didn't listen. That's why this trouble has come upon us."
1:42:22: Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we're paying the price for his blood."
1:42:23: They didn't realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.
1:42:24: Joseph turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
1:42:25: Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, return each man's silver to his sack, and provide them with provisions for their journey. This was done for them.
1:42:26: They loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
1:42:27: At the place where they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
1:42:28: "My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank, and they turned to each other trembling, asking, "What has God done to us?"
1:42:29: When they arrived back at their father Jacob's house in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them:
1:42:30: "The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
1:42:31: But we told him, 'We're honest men, not spies.
1:42:32: We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no longer living, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'
1:42:33: Then the man who is the lord of the land said to us, 'This is how I'll know if you're honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take grain for your starving households, and go.
1:42:34: Bring your youngest brother to me so I can verify your words, and then you won't die.' So we did as he said."
1:42:35: As they were emptying their sacks, they discovered that each man's silver was in his sack. When they and their father saw the bundles of silver, they were afraid.
1:42:36: Jacob, their father, said to them, "You've deprived me of my children! Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin? Everything is going against me!"
1:42:37: Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I don't bring Benjamin back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back."
1:42:38: But Jacob replied, "My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead, and he's the only one left. If any harm comes to him on the journey you're taking, you'll bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow."
1:43:1:Now the famine was severe in the land.
1:43:2:So when they had eaten up all the grain they brought from Egypt, their father Jacob said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."
1:43:3:But Judah responded, "The man sternly warned us, 'You won't see my face unless your brother is with you.'
1:43:4:If you're willing to send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy food for you.
1:43:5:But if you won't send him, we won't go, because the man told us, 'You won't see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
1:43:6:Jacob asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"
1:43:7:They replied, "The man kept asking about our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How could we know he would demand that we bring our brother down?"
1:43:8:Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me, and we will set out so that we may live and not die—both we and you, and our little ones.
1:43:9:I will personally guarantee his safety; you can hold me responsible if I don't bring him back to you. Then let me bear the blame forever.
1:43:10:If we hadn't wasted time, we could have already made two trips by now!"
1:43:11:Their father Israel agreed, "If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and carry them down as a gift for the man—a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, pistachios, and almonds.
1:43:12:Also take twice the amount of money with you, as you must return the money that was put back in your sacks. It might have been a mistake.
1:43:13:Take your brother too, and go back to the man at once.
1:43:14:May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, so that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, then I am bereaved."
1:43:15:The men took the gifts, double the amount of money, and Benjamin, and set out for Egypt. There, they stood before Joseph.
1:43:16:When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his steward, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal, and prepare it, for they will dine with me at noon."
1:43:17:The man did as Joseph ordered and brought the men to Joseph's house.
1:43:18:But the brothers were afraid when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We're being brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks earlier. He'll use this as an excuse to attack us, enslave us, and confiscate our donkeys."
1:43:19:So they approached Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.
1:43:20:They said, "Sir, we indeed came down here the first time to buy food,
1:43:21:but when we arrived at our lodging place and opened our sacks, we found each one's money at the top of his sack. We've brought it back in full.
1:43:22:We also brought additional money to buy food. We don't know who put the money in our sacks."
1:43:23:The steward replied, "Peace to you, don't be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
1:43:24:After taking the men into Joseph's house, he provided water for them to wash their feet and food for their donkeys.
1:43:25:They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon because they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
1:43:26:When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
1:43:27:He asked them how they were doing, and then said, "How is your elderly father you mentioned? Is he still alive?"
1:43:28:They answered, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed down to show their respect.
1:43:29:Looking around and seeing his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he asked, "Is this your younger brother you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
1:43:30:Joseph hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he wanted to weep. He went into a private room and cried there.
1:43:31:After washing his face, he regained his composure and came back out. He ordered, "Serve the meal."
1:43:32:They served Joseph by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, as that was detestable to them.
1:43:33:The brothers were seated in front of him by age, from the firstborn to the youngest. They looked at each other in amazement.
1:43:34:Portions of food from Joseph's table were brought to them, but Benjamin's portion was five times larger than any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
1:44:1: Joseph commanded his steward, "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's money back at the top of his sack.
1:44:2: Then place my silver cup in the mouth of the youngest one's sack, along with the money for his grain." The steward did as Joseph instructed.
1:44:3: At dawn, the brothers were sent on their way with their donkeys.
1:44:4: They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Go after those men! When you catch up with them, ask them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?
1:44:5: Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and uses for divination? You have done a wicked thing.'"
1:44:6: So the steward caught up with them and repeated these words.
1:44:7: They replied, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
1:44:8: Look, we even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found inside our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
1:44:9: If any of us is found to have the cup, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves."
1:44:10: The steward said, "Very well, then. Let it be as you say: whoever is found to have the cup will become my slave, but the rest of you will be innocent."
1:44:11: Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
1:44:12: The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
1:44:13: They tore their clothes in despair, loaded their donkeys again, and returned to the city.
1:44:14: When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him.
1:44:15: Joseph asked them, "What have you done? Didn't you know that a man like me can find things out through divination?"
1:44:16: Judah replied, "What can we say, my lord? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. We are now my lord's slaves—we and the one who was found to have the cup."
1:44:17: But Joseph said, "I couldn't do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you may go back to your father in peace."
1:44:18: Then Judah approached Joseph and said, "Please, my lord, allow your servant to speak a word to you. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.
1:44:19: My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
1:44:20: And we answered, 'We have an elderly father and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'
1:44:21: Then you told us, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.'
1:44:22: But we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he were to leave, his father would die.'
1:44:23: Then you said to us, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
1:44:24: When we went back to your servant, our father, we told him what you had said.
1:44:25: Later, our father said, 'Go back and buy a little more food.'
1:44:26: But we replied, 'We cannot go down unless our youngest brother is with us. We can only go if our youngest brother accompanies us.'
1:44:27: Your servant, our father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
1:44:28: One of them went away from me, and I said, "He must have been torn to pieces," for I haven't seen him since.
1:44:29: If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.'
1:44:30: Now, if I return to your servant, my father, without the boy, and his life is so bound up with the boy's life,
1:44:31: when he sees that the boy isn't with us, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.
1:44:32: For I, your servant, guaranteed the boy's safety to my father. I said, 'If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life.'
1:44:33: Now then, please let me stay here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
1:44:34: How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I cannot bear to see the anguish that would come upon my father."
1:45:1:Joseph could no longer control his emotions in front of all his attendants, so he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" Thus, no one else was around when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers.
1:45:2:He wept loudly, and the Egyptians heard it, as well as Pharaoh's household.
1:45:3:Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers were too shocked to respond.
1:45:4:Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come closer to me." When they had come near, he continued, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
1:45:5:Now, don't be distressed or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to save lives.
1:45:6:For two years now, there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years, there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
1:45:7:God sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth and to save your lives in an extraordinary way.
1:45:8:So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord over his entire household, and ruler of all Egypt.
1:45:9:Hurry back to my father and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay.
1:45:10:You will live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything you have.
1:45:11:I will provide for you there, since there are still five years of famine to come. Otherwise, you, your household, and everything you own will become destitute.'
1:45:12:You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.
1:45:13:Tell my father about all the honor I have received in Egypt and everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly."
1:45:14:Then Joseph embraced his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder.
1:45:15:Joseph kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After that, his brothers talked with him.
1:45:16:The news reached Pharaoh's palace: "Joseph's brothers have come." Pharaoh and his officials were pleased.
1:45:17:Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,
1:45:18:and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you can enjoy the abundance of the land.'
1:45:19:You are also directed to tell them, 'Take wagons from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.
1:45:20:Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.'"
1:45:21:So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them wagons, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also provided them with provisions for their journey.
1:45:22:To each of them, he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin, he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
1:45:23:He sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other provisions for his journey.
1:45:24:Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving, he told them, "Don't quarrel on the way!"
1:45:25:So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
1:45:26:They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.
1:45:27:But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
1:45:28:Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
1:46:1:Israel set out on his journey with all that he had, and when he arrived at Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
1:46:2:During the night, God spoke to Israel in a vision, saying, "Jacob, Jacob!" He replied, "Here I am."
1:46:3:God said, "I am the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.
1:46:4:I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back. Joseph will close your eyes when you die."
1:46:5:Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons took him and their children and wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport them.
1:46:6:They also brought their livestock and possessions they had acquired in Canaan. So Jacob and his entire family went to Egypt.
1:46:7:His sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters, and all his descendants accompanied him to Egypt.
1:46:8:These are the names of the Israelites who went to Egypt, Jacob and his descendants: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
1:46:9:The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
1:46:10:The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
1:46:11:The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1:46:12:The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. However, Er and Onan had died in Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
1:46:13:The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.
1:46:14:The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
1:46:15:These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, along with their sister Dinah. In total, there were thirty-three descendants of Leah.
1:46:16:The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
1:46:17:The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malkiel.
1:46:18:These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She bore these sixteen children to Jacob.
1:46:19:The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
1:46:20:In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1:46:21:The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
1:46:22:These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob. In total, there were fourteen descendants of Rachel.
1:46:23:The son of Dan: Hushim.
1:46:24:The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
1:46:25:These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these seven children to Jacob.
1:46:26:All those who went with Jacob to Egypt, his direct descendants (excluding his sons' wives), numbered sixty-six persons.
1:46:27:Including Joseph's two sons who were born in Egypt, the total number of Jacob's family in Egypt was seventy.
1:46:28:Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph so that he could show them the way to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,
1:46:29:Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen. As soon as he saw him, he threw his arms around him and wept for a long time.
1:46:30:Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen your face and know you are still alive."
1:46:31:Joseph told his brothers and his father's household, "I will go up and inform Pharaoh, and tell him, 'My brothers and my father's household from the land of Canaan have come to me.
1:46:32:The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought their flocks, herds, and all their possessions.'
1:46:33:When Pharaoh calls for you and asks, 'What is your occupation?'
1:46:34:You should answer, 'Your servants have tended livestock from our youth until now, both we and our fathers.' This way, you can settle in the region of Goshen, since all shepherds are detestable to Egyptians."
1:47:1:Joseph went to Pharaoh and told him, "My father and my brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks, herds, and everything they own. They are now in the region of Goshen."
1:47:2:He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
1:47:3:Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What do you do for a living?" They replied, "We are shepherds, just like our ancestors."
1:47:4:They also told Pharaoh, "We have come to live here temporarily because there is no pasture for our flocks in Canaan. We request permission to settle in the region of Goshen."
1:47:5:Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you,
1:47:6:and Egypt is at your disposal. Settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any skilled workers among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
1:47:7:Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
1:47:8:Pharaoh asked Jacob, "How old are you?"
1:47:9:Jacob answered, "I have lived for 130 years. My years have been difficult and not as many as those of my ancestors during their journey on this earth."
1:47:10:After blessing Pharaoh again, Jacob left his presence.
1:47:11:Joseph settled his father and brothers in Egypt, providing them with property in the best part of the land, in the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered.
1:47:12:Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all their families, according to the number of their dependents.
1:47:13:There was no food in the land due to the severe famine. People in Egypt and Canaan were weak from hunger.
1:47:14:Joseph collected all the money that could be found in Egypt and Canaan for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.
1:47:15:When the people of Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money, they went to Joseph and said, "Give us food! Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is gone."
1:47:16:Joseph replied, "If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for them."
1:47:17:So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. He provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
1:47:18:When that year ended, they came to him the following year and said, "We cannot hide from you, our lord, that our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
1:47:19:Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we will become Pharaoh's slaves. Give us seed so we can survive and not die, and so the land does not become desolate."
1:47:20:So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians sold their fields because the famine was so severe, and the land became Pharaoh's property.
1:47:21:He made the people slaves from one end of Egypt to the other.
1:47:22:However, he did not buy the land of the priests because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
1:47:23:Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Plant the seed on the land.
1:47:24:At harvest time, you must give a fifth of your produce to Pharaoh. You may keep four-fifths as seed for your fields and as food for yourselves, your households, and your children."
1:47:25:The people replied, "You have saved our lives! We are grateful to you, our lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves."
1:47:26:So Joseph established it as a law in Egypt that still exists today: Pharaoh should receive one-fifth of the harvest, except for the land of the priests, which did not become Pharaoh's property.
1:47:27:Israel settled in Egypt, in the region of Gosh
1:47:28:Jacob and his family lived in Egypt for seventeen years. He lived a total of 147 years.
1:47:29:When the time approached for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
1:47:30:but when I rest with my ancestors, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." Joseph answered, "I will do as you say."
1:47:31:Jacob said, "Swear to me," and Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed.
1:48:1:At that time, Joseph was told that his father Jacob had become ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him.
1:48:2:When Jacob heard that his son Joseph had come to see him, he gathered his strength and sat up in bed.
1:48:3:Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there He blessed me.
1:48:4:He told me, 'I will make you fruitful and multiply your descendants. I will give this land to your offspring as an everlasting possession.'
1:48:5:Now, your two sons who were born to you in Egypt before I came here, Manasseh and Ephraim, are my own just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
1:48:6:Any children you have after them will be yours, but their inheritance will be counted under the names of their brothers.
1:48:7:As for me, when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died in the land of Canaan along the way, not far from Ephrath. I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, which is now called Bethlehem."
1:48:8:Then Israel saw Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are these?"
1:48:9:Joseph replied, "These are the sons God has given me here." And Jacob said, "Please bring them to me so I can bless them."
1:48:10:Israel's eyesight was weak because of his age, so he couldn't see well. Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed and embraced them.
1:48:11:Jacob said to Joseph, "I never thought I'd see your face again, but now God has also allowed me to see your children."
1:48:12:Joseph moved his sons away from Jacob's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
1:48:13:He then positioned Ephraim on his right, which was Israel's left, and Manasseh on his left, which was Israel's right, and brought them close to him.
1:48:14:But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, even though he was the younger, and crossed his arms, placing his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
1:48:15:Jacob blessed Joseph, saying, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life until this day,
1:48:16:The Angel who has redeemed me from all harm, bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1:48:17:When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him. He took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
1:48:18:Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father! This is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
1:48:19:But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a great nation, and he too will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a multitude of nations."
1:48:20:That day, Jacob blessed them, saying, "By you, Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
1:48:21:Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.
1:48:22:Moreover, I have given you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow."
1:49:1: Jacob called for his sons and said, "Gather around, so I can tell you what will happen to you in the future.
1:49:2: Come together and listen, sons of Jacob; pay attention to your father Israel.
1:49:3: Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength and the beginning of my power, excelling in honor and excelling in might.
1:49:4: But you are as unstable as water, and you won't excel, because you slept with your father's concubine, defiling my marriage bed.
1:49:5: Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords are weapons of violence.
1:49:6: Let me not join their secret meetings, nor be part of their wicked plans. For in their anger they killed men, and at their whim they crippled oxen.
1:49:7: Cursed is their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will scatter them throughout Israel.
1:49:8: Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies, and your father's sons will bow down before you.
1:49:9: You are like a lion, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion, he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?
1:49:10: The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes and the nations obey him.
1:49:11: He will tether his donkey to a vine, and his colt to the choicest branch. He will wash his garments in wine, and his robes in the blood of grapes.
1:49:12: His eyes will be darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
1:49:13: Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.
1:49:14: Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two saddlebags.
1:49:15: When he sees that his resting place is good and the land is pleasant, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.
1:49:16: Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
1:49:17: Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so its rider falls backward.
1:49:18: I look for your deliverance, O Lord.
1:49:19: Gad will be attacked by raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.
1:49:20: Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
1:49:21: Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
1:49:22: Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall.
1:49:23: Archers bitterly attacked him, shooting at him and harassing him.
1:49:24: But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.
1:49:25: The God of your father will help you, and the Almighty will bless you with blessings from the heavens above, blessings from the deep that lies below, and blessings of the breast and womb.
1:49:26: Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, and the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
1:49:27: Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the plunder."
1:50:1: Joseph threw himself upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
1:50:2: He then ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel; so they embalmed him.
1:50:3: The process took forty days, for that is how long it takes to embalm. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
1:50:4: When the mourning period was over, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's household, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh on my behalf.
1:50:5: Tell him, 'My father made me swear an oath, saying, "I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my father, and then return.'"
1:50:6: Pharaoh agreed, "Go and bury your father, as he made you promise."
1:50:7: So Joseph went to bury his father. All of Pharaoh's officials, the senior members of his household, and all the senior officials of Egypt accompanied him,
1:50:8: along with Joseph's entire family, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, flocks, and herds were left behind in Goshen.
1:50:9: Chariots and horsemen also went with him, forming a very impressive procession.
1:50:10: When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan River, they observed a solemn ceremony of mourning and lamentation. Joseph mourned for his father seven days there.
1:50:11: The Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad and said, "This is a deep mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore, the place was named Abel Mizraim, which is near the Jordan.
1:50:12: Jacob's sons did as he had instructed them.
1:50:13: They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah, in the field near Mamre that Abraham had purchased as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
1:50:14: After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him.
1:50:15: When Joseph's brothers realized their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrong we did to him?"
1:50:16: So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father left these instructions before he died:
1:50:17: 'Tell Joseph to forgive his brothers' transgressions and sins, for they treated him badly.' Now, please forgive our wrongdoing, for we are servants of your father's God." When Joseph received this message, he wept.
1:50:18: His brothers also came and threw themselves down before him. "We are your slaves," they said.
1:50:19: But Joseph reassured them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
1:50:20: You intended to harm me, but God meant it for good, to bring about the survival of many people, as is happening now.
1:50:21: So don't worry; I will provide for you and your families." And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
1:50:22: Joseph remained in Egypt, along with his father's family. He lived to be 110 years old.
1:50:23: He saw Ephraim's children to the third generation, and the children of Manasseh's son Machir were also recognized as his own.
1:50:24: Near the end, Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
1:50:25: And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, "When God comes to help you, you must carry my bones up from this place."
1:50:26: Joseph died at the age of 110. They embalmed him, and his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
