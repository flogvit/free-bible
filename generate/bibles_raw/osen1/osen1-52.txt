52:1:1:From Paul, Silas, and Timothy, to the church of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.
52:1:2:We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
52:1:3:Constantly remembering your work of faith, labor of love, and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
52:1:4:Brothers and sisters, we know that God loves you and has chosen you.
52:1:5:For our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with full conviction. You know how we lived among you for your benefit.
52:1:6:And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, welcoming the message with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, despite great suffering.
52:1:7:As a result, you became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
52:1:8:For the Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where your faith in God has become known. We don't even need to say anything about it.
52:1:9:People everywhere report how you welcomed us when we visited you, and how you turned away from idols to serve the living and true God.
52:1:10:Now you eagerly await the return of his Son from heaven, Jesus, whom he raised from the dead—our savior who rescues us from the coming wrath.
52:2:1:In our previous visit, you know how we treated you for your sake, with courage in our God to speak the gospel of God despite great opposition.
52:2:2:Indeed, our message didn't come from deceit or impure motives, nor were we trying to trick you.
52:2:3:Instead, we spoke as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, not seeking to please people but God, who examines our hearts.
52:2:4:As you are aware, we never used flattering words or hidden motives of greed—God is our witness.
52:2:5:Neither did we seek praise from people, whether from you or others, although as apostles of Christ, we could have asserted our authority.
52:2:6:But we were gentle among you, like a nurturing mother who tenderly cares for her own children.
52:2:7:With such affection for you, we were happy to share not only the gospel of God but also our very lives because you had become dear to us.
52:2:8:You remember, brothers and sisters, our hard work and dedication. We labored night and day so as not to burden any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you.
52:2:9:You and God can testify how devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves among you believers.
52:2:10:As you know, we dealt with each of you as a father does with his own children, encouraging, comforting, and urging you
52:2:11:to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
52:2:12:We continually thank God that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as it truly is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.
52:2:13:For this reason, brothers and sisters, we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.
52:2:14:You became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,
52:2:15:who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all people,
52:2:16:forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way, they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
52:2:17:But, brothers and sisters, when we were separated from you for a short time (in person, not in heart), we eagerly longed to see you face to face.
52:2:18:We wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—but Satan hindered us.
52:2:19:For who is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
52:2:20:Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
52:3:1:So when we could bear it no longer, we decided to stay in Athens alone,
52:3:2:and sent Timothy, our brother and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you concerning your faith,
52:3:3:in order to prevent any of you from being shaken by these trials. For you know that we are destined for such difficulties.
52:3:4:Indeed, when we were with you, we warned you that we would suffer persecution; and as you know, it has come to pass.
52:3:5:For this reason, I also sent Timothy when I could no longer endure the suspense, to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter might have tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
52:3:6:But now that Timothy has returned to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and love, and that you always remember us fondly and long to see us just as we long to see you,
52:3:7:therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution, we are encouraged about you because of your faith.
52:3:8:For now we truly live if you stand firm in the Lord.
52:3:9:How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
52:3:10:Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
52:3:11:Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, clear the way for us to come to you.
52:3:12:And may the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow and overflow, just as our love does for you.
52:3:13:So that he may strengthen your hearts, making them blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.
52:4:1:Furthermore, brothers and sisters, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that pleases God, just as you have already learned from us. Keep improving in your walk with Him.
52:4:2:You know the instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
52:4:3:God's will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all forms of sexual immorality.
52:4:4:Each one of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
52:4:5:not giving in to lustful passions like those who don't know God.
52:4:6:Never take advantage of or exploit a fellow believer in this matter, because the Lord will punish all those who commit such sins. We have warned you about this before.
52:4:7:God has not called us to live impure lives, but to be holy.
52:4:8:So anyone who rejects these instructions is not rejecting a human being, but God Himself, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.
52:4:9:Concerning brotherly love, you don't need us to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.
52:4:10:Indeed, you are already showing love to all the believers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, dear friends, to keep doing more.
52:4:11:Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you.
52:4:12:This way, you'll gain the respect of outsiders and won't be dependent on anyone.
52:4:13:We want you to be informed, brothers and sisters, about those who have passed away, so you don't grieve like others who have no hope.
52:4:14:For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, then we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have died in Him.
52:4:15:According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
52:4:16:For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud command, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
52:4:17:After that, we who are still alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.
52:4:18:Therefore, comfort one another with these words.
52:5:1:Now, concerning the times and seasons, friends, you don't need me to write to you.
52:5:2:You are well aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
52:5:3:When people say, "Peace and safety," sudden destruction will come upon them, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
52:5:4:But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
52:5:5:For you are all children of light and children of the day. We don't belong to the night or to darkness.
52:5:6:So then, let's not sleep like others do, but let's stay awake and be sober.
52:5:7:Those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
52:5:8:But since we belong to the day, let's be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
52:5:9:God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
52:5:10:who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
52:5:11:Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
52:5:12:We ask you, friends, to respect those who work among you, lead you in the Lord, and admonish you.
52:5:13:Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
52:5:14:We urge you, friends, to warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.
52:5:15:Make sure that no one repays evil for evil, but always strive to do good to one another and to everyone.
52:5:16:Rejoice always,
52:5:17:pray continually,
52:5:18:give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
52:5:19:Do not quench the Spirit;
52:5:20:do not treat prophecies with contempt,
52:5:21:but test everything; hold on to what is good,
52:5:22:and avoid every kind of evil.
52:5:23:May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
52:5:24:The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
52:5:25:Friends, please pray for us.
52:5:26:Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.
52:5:27:I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers and sisters.
52:5:28:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
