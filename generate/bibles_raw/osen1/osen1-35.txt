35:1:1:The message that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision.
35:1:2:Lord, how long will I cry out for help and you not listen? I tell you about violence, but you don't save us!
35:1:3:Why do you make me see wrongdoing and let me witness trouble? Destruction and violence are right in front of me; there is strife, and conflict is everywhere.
35:1:4:As a result, the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked surround the righteous, so justice comes out twisted.
35:1:5:Look among the nations and watch—be utterly astounded! For I am doing something in your days that you wouldn't believe even if you were told.
35:1:6:I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impulsive nation, who march across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own.
35:1:7:They are fearsome and dreadful; their justice and authority originate with themselves.
35:1:8:Their horses are faster than leopards, more ferocious than wolves at dusk. Their horsemen charge ahead; their horsemen come from afar, flying like an eagle swooping to devour.
35:1:9:All of them come for violence; their faces are set like the east wind. They gather captives like sand.
35:1:10:They scoff at kings and laugh at rulers. They deride every fortified city, building earthen ramps and capturing them.
35:1:11:Then they sweep past like the wind and move on—guilty people, whose own strength is their god.
35:1:12:But Lord, aren't you everlasting? You are my holy God, who doesn't die. Lord, you have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish.
35:1:13:Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do you put up with those who are treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
35:1:14:You have made people like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.
35:1:15:The wicked pull all of them up with hooks, catching them in their nets and gathering them in their dragnets; so they rejoice and celebrate.
35:1:16:Therefore, they worship their nets and burn incense to their dragnets, for by these things their portion is rich and their food plentiful.
35:1:17:Will they continue to empty their nets, mercilessly killing nations without pity?
35:2:1:Listen up, I'll stand at my watch post and position myself on the tower. I'll keep an eye out to see what he will say to me, and what answer I'll receive when I complain.
35:2:2:Then the Lord answered me and said, "Write down the vision clearly on tablets, so that anyone who reads it can run with it.
35:2:3:The vision is for a future time; it describes events that will happen in the end. Though it may seem slow in coming, wait patiently for it, because it will certainly take place; it won't be delayed.
35:2:4:Look at the proud! Their spirit isn't right within them, but the righteous person will live by their faithfulness.
35:2:5:Moreover, since wine betrays, the arrogant won't find rest. They're never satisfied, like the grave or death itself. They gather all nations to themselves and collect all peoples as if they were their own.
35:2:6:Won't everyone taunt them and ridicule them with riddles? They'll say, 'Woe to the one who piles up stolen goods and makes himself rich through extortion! How long can this go on?'
35:2:7:Won't your creditors suddenly rise up? Those who make you tremble will wake up, and you'll become their prey.
35:2:8:Because you've plundered many nations, all the remaining people will plunder you. You've shed human blood and destroyed lands, cities, and everyone in them.
35:2:9:Woe to the one who gains dishonest profit for his house, setting his nest on high to escape the reach of disaster!
35:2:10:You've planned shame for your house by wiping out many peoples and sinning against your own soul.
35:2:11:The stones of the wall will cry out, and the wooden beams will echo the sound.
35:2:12:Woe to the one who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice!
35:2:13:Hasn't the Lord Almighty determined that the work of the nations is only fuel for the fire, and that they labor in vain?
35:2:14:But the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
35:2:15:Woe to the one who gives his neighbor drink, pouring out your wrath and even making them drunk, in order to gaze at their nakedness!
35:2:16:You'll be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it's your turn! Drink and expose your own nakedness! The cup from the Lord's right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
35:2:17:The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of animals will terrify you. You've shed human blood and destroyed lands, cities, and everyone in them.
35:2:18:What good is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or a cast image that deceives you? The one who makes these things trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that can't speak.
35:2:19:Woe to the one who says to wood, 'Come to life!' or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It's covered with gold and silver, but there's no breath in it.
35:2:20:But the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him."
35:3:1:In this prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, he pleads with God:
35:3:2:Lord, I have heard about your fame and am in awe of your deeds. Please do them again in our time; make them known even now, despite your anger, show us your mercy.
35:3:3:God comes from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covers the heavens, and his praise fills the earth.
35:3:4:His brightness is like the sunlight; rays of light stream from his hand, where his power is hidden.
35:3:5:Pestilence goes before him, and plague follows in his footsteps.
35:3:6:He stands still, measuring the earth; he looks around and causes nations to tremble. The age-old mountains crumble, and the ancient hills collapse—his ways are everlasting.
35:3:7:I see the tents of Cushan in distress; the dwellings of Midian tremble in fear.
35:3:8:Was it against the rivers, Lord, that you displayed your wrath? Was your anger directed at the sea when you rode on your horses, with your chariots of salvation?
35:3:9:You uncovered your bow and commanded many arrows. You split the earth with rivers.
35:3:10:The mountains saw you and quaked; torrents of water swept by. The deep roared and lifted its waves high.
35:3:11:Sun and moon stood still in the sky as your brilliant arrows flew and your lightning flashed all around.
35:3:12:In wrath, you marched through the earth; in anger, you trampled the nations.
35:3:13:You went out to save your people, to rescue your chosen one. You crushed the head of the wicked, stripping him from head to toe.
35:3:14:With his own spear, you pierced the leader of his warriors who stormed out to scatter us, gloating as if ready to devour the weak who were in hiding.
35:3:15:You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
35:3:16:I heard, and my heart pounded; my lips quivered at the sound. Decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come upon the nation invading us.
35:3:17:Though the fig tree does not bud, and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,
35:3:18:Still, I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior.
35:3:19:The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights.
