59:1:1:James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends greetings to the twelve tribes scattered throughout the world.
59:1:2:My friends, consider it pure joy when you face various trials,
59:1:3:because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
59:1:4:Let perseverance finish its work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
59:1:5:If any of you lacks wisdom, ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.
59:1:6:But when you ask, believe without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
59:1:7:Such a person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59:1:8:A double-minded individual is unstable in all their ways.
59:1:9:Let the believer in humble circumstances take pride in their high position.
59:1:10:But the rich should take pride in their humiliation, since they will pass away like a wildflower.
59:1:11:For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls, and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.
59:1:12:Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
59:1:13:When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.
59:1:14:Instead, each person is tempted when they are lured and enticed by their own desires.
59:1:15:Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.
59:1:16:Do not be deceived, my dear friends.
59:1:17:Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
59:1:18:He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
59:1:19:My dear friends, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry,
59:1:20:because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
59:1:21:Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent, and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save your souls.
59:1:22:Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
59:1:23:For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, they are like a person who looks at their face in a mirror
59:1:24:and, after looking at themselves, goes away and immediately forgets what they look like.
59:1:25:But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.
59:1:26:If anyone considers themselves religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on their tongue, they deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.
59:1:27:Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
59:2:1:My dear friends, do not show favoritism as you hold on to your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.
59:2:2:For example, if someone wearing fancy clothes and gold rings comes into your assembly, and a poor person in shabby clothes also enters,
59:2:3:and you pay special attention to the one wearing fine clothes, saying, "Please sit here in this good place," while you say to the poor person, "Stand over there," or "Sit at my feet,"
59:2:4:are you not making distinctions among yourselves and becoming judges with evil thoughts?
59:2:5:Listen, my beloved friends: Hasn't God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and inheritors of the kingdom He promised to those who love Him?
59:2:6:But you have dishonored the poor. Don't the rich oppress you and drag you into court?
59:2:7:Don't they blaspheme the noble name by which you are called?
59:2:8:If you truly fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well.
59:2:9:But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
59:2:10:Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in just one point has become guilty of breaking all of it.
59:2:11:For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
59:2:12:So speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.
59:2:13:For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
59:2:14:What good is it, my friends, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?
59:2:15:Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food,
59:2:16:and one of you says to them, "Go in peace; stay warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is that?
59:2:17:In the same way, faith by itself, if not accompanied by action, is dead.
59:2:18:But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
59:2:19:You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
59:2:20:Do you want proof, you foolish person, that faith without deeds is useless?
59:2:21:Wasn't our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59:2:22:You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.
59:2:23:And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called God's friend.
59:2:24:You see that a person is justified by what they do and not by faith alone.
59:2:25:In the same way, wasn't even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?
59:2:26:As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
59:3:1:My dear friends, not many of you should become teachers, because we who teach will be judged more strictly.
59:3:2:We all make mistakes in various ways. If someone never makes a mistake in what they say, they are perfect and can control their whole body.
59:3:3:When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide their whole bodies as well.
59:3:4:Consider ships too. Though they are so large and driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
59:3:5:In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts of great things. A tiny spark can set a great forest on fire.
59:3:6:The tongue is also like a fire. It's a world of evil among the parts of our body. It corrupts our entire being and sets our lives on fire, and it is itself set on fire by hell.
59:3:7:People have tamed all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures, and continue to do so.
59:3:8:But no one can tame the tongue. It is restless, full of deadly poison.
59:3:9:With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who have been made in God's likeness.
59:3:10:Out of the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My friends, this should not be the case.
59:3:11:Does a spring pour forth both fresh and bitter water from the same opening?
59:3:12:Can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water.
59:3:13:Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them show it by their good conduct, with deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
59:3:14:But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
59:3:15:Such "wisdom" does not come from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
59:3:16:For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every kind of evil.
59:3:17:But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, and sincere.
59:3:18:And those who make peace sow the seeds of righteousness in a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.
59:4:1:What causes fights and quarrels among you? Isn't it the desires that battle within you?
59:4:2:You want things, but you don't get them. So you kill and covet, but still you cannot obtain what you desire. You argue and fight, but you do not have because you do not ask.
59:4:3:And when you ask, you don't receive because you ask with wrong motives, just to satisfy your own selfish desires.
59:4:4:You unfaithful people! Don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, if you choose to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.
59:4:5:Do you think the Scripture says without reason that the spirit He caused to live in us yearns jealously?
59:4:6:But He gives us more grace. That's why the Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."
59:4:7:Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59:4:8:Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59:4:9:Mourn, weep, and feel sorrow for your sins. Let your laughter turn to mourning and your joy to gloom.
59:4:10:Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up.
59:4:11:Don't speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
59:4:12:There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who can save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?
59:4:13:Listen up, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make money."
59:4:14:You don't even know what will happen tomorrow! Your life is like a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59:4:15:Instead, you should say, "If it's the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that."
59:4:16:As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.
59:4:17:So if anyone knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it's a sin for them.
59:5:1:Listen up, you rich folks! Weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you.
59:5:2:Your wealth has rotted, and your clothes have been eaten by moths.
59:5:3:Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in these last days.
59:5:4:Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
59:5:5:You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence; you have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
59:5:6:You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.
59:5:7:So be patient, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until it receives the early and late rains.
59:5:8:You too, be patient and strengthen your hearts, because the Lord's coming is near.
59:5:9:Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
59:5:10:Take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patience in the face of suffering.
59:5:11:Indeed, we consider those blessed who persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
59:5:12:Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple "Yes" or "No." Otherwise you will be condemned.
59:5:13:Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise.
59:5:14:Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
59:5:15:The prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
59:5:16:Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
59:5:17:Elijah was a human being, just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
59:5:18:Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
59:5:19:My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone brings that person back,
59:5:20:remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
