3:1:1:Now, the LORD spoke to Moses from the Meeting Tent, saying,
3:1:2:"Tell the Israelites that when they bring an offering to the LORD, they may choose an animal from their cattle or flock as a burnt offering, one without any defects.
3:1:3:If the offering is a bull from the herd, it must be a male without blemish. They should bring it to the entrance of the Meeting Tent so it will be accepted by the LORD.
3:1:4:They will lay their hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on their behalf to make atonement for them.
3:1:5:The bull shall then be slaughtered before the LORD, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood and sprinkle it around the altar at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
3:1:6:The person who brought the offering must skin the animal and cut it into pieces.
3:1:7:Aaron's sons, the priests, will put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
3:1:8:Then, the priests will arrange the pieces of the offering, including the head and fat, on the burning wood on the altar.
3:1:9:The internal organs and legs must be washed with water, and the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:1:10:If the offering is from the flock—either a sheep or a goat—as a burnt offering, it must be a male without any defects.
3:1:11:The animal will be killed on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on the altar.
3:1:12:The person who brought the offering must cut it into pieces, and the priest will arrange them, including the head and fat, on the burning wood on the altar.
3:1:13:The internal organs and legs must be washed with water, and the priest will offer all of it as a burnt offering on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:1:14:If the offering is a bird—a turtledove or a young pigeon—the priest will present it at the altar.
3:1:15:The priest will wring off its head, burn it on the altar, and drain its blood on the side of the altar.
3:1:16:He will remove the crop and its contents, and throw them on the east side of the altar where the ashes are.
3:1:17:The priest will then tear the bird open by its wings without separating them, and burn it on the altar, on top of the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:2:1:In this way, when someone offers a grain offering to the Lord, their offering should be of fine flour. They are to pour oil on it and place frankincense over it.
3:2:2:Then they must bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests. One of them will take a handful of the fine flour mixed with oil, along with all the frankincense, and burn it as a memorial portion on the altar, which is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
3:2:3:The remainder of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is considered a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the Lord.
3:2:4:If you decide to offer a baked grain offering, it should be made of fine flour without yeast, either as unleavened loaves mixed with oil or as unleavened wafers coated in oil.
3:2:5:If your offering is a grain offering cooked on a griddle, it should be made of fine flour mixed with oil, and without yeast.
3:2:6:Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
3:2:7:If your offering is a grain offering prepared in a pan, it should be made of fine flour with oil.
3:2:8:When you bring the grain offering made of these things to the Lord, present it to the priest, who shall take it to the altar.
3:2:9:The priest will remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
3:2:10:The remaining part of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the Lord.
3:2:11:No grain offering that you bring to the Lord shall be made with yeast, for you must not burn any yeast or honey as an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:2:12:You may offer them to the Lord as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
3:2:13:Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not let the salt of the covenant with your God be missing from your grain offerings; include salt with all your offerings.
3:2:14:If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, you should offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire.
3:2:15:Put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
3:2:16:The priest will burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all the frankincense, as an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:3:1:If someone offers a peace offering to the Lord, they may choose an animal from the herd or the flock. It should be without defect and offered willingly.
3:3:2:They will lay their hands on the head of the offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. The priests, Aaron's sons, will sprinkle its blood around the altar.
3:3:3:The person must then present part of the offering as a food offering to the Lord: the fat that covers the inner organs, all the fat on the internal organs,
3:3:4:both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
3:3:5:Aaron's sons will burn these parts on the altar atop the burnt offering already there, which rests on the wood fire. This is a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:3:6:If the peace offering is from the flock, they may offer a male or female without defect.
3:3:7:If they bring a lamb as their offering, they will present it before the Lord.
3:3:8:They will lay their hands on the head of their offering and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Aaron's sons will then sprinkle its blood around the altar.
3:3:9:As a food offering to the Lord, they will present the fat: the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the fat that covers the inner organs, all the fat on the internal organs,
3:3:10:both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
3:3:11:The priest will burn these parts on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:3:12:If their offering is a goat, they will present it before the Lord.
3:3:13:They will lay their hands on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Aaron's sons will then sprinkle its blood around the altar.
3:3:14:From the offering, they will present as a food offering to the Lord: the fat that covers the inner organs, all the fat on the internal organs,
3:3:15:both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
3:3:16:The priest will burn these parts on the altar as food, an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma. All the fat belongs to the Lord.
3:3:17:This is a permanent law for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.
3:4:1:If someone unintentionally sins by not following the commands of the Lord, the priest will present a young bull without blemish as a sin offering.
3:4:2:They will bring the bull to the entrance of the Meeting Tent before the Lord, lay their hand on its head, and slaughter it there.
3:4:3:The anointed priest will take some of the bull's blood and bring it into the Meeting Tent.
3:4:4:He will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
3:4:5:The priest will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the Lord in the Meeting Tent. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
3:4:6:From the sin offering, the priest will remove all the fat, just as he does with the peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. This will make atonement for the person who sinned.
3:4:7:Next, the priest will take the bull outside the camp and burn its hide, flesh, and dung with fire.
3:4:8:If the entire congregation of Israel unintentionally sins, and the sin becomes known, they must offer a young bull as a sin offering. They will bring it before the Meeting Tent.
3:4:9:The elders of the community will lay their hands on the bull's head before the Lord, and the bull will be slaughtered there.
3:4:10:The anointed priest will bring some of the bull's blood into the Meeting Tent.
3:4:11:He will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil.
3:4:12:He will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord in the Meeting Tent. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.
3:4:13:From the sin offering, he will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar.
3:4:14:Then, he will take the bull outside the camp and burn its hide, flesh, and dung with fire. This will make atonement for the congregation.
3:4:15:If a leader unintentionally sins by not following the commands of the Lord, he must offer a male goat without blemish as a sin offering.
3:4:16:The leader will lay his hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered before the Lord. This is a sin offering.
3:4:17:The priest will then dip his finger in the blood of the sin offering and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:18:He will burn all the fat on the altar, just as he does with the peace offerings. This will make atonement for the leader's sin, and he will be forgiven.
3:4:19:If any member of the community unintentionally sins, they must bring a female goat without blemish as a sin offering.
3:4:20:They will lay their hand on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered before the Lord.
3:4:21:The priest will dip his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:22:He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar, just as he does with the peace offerings. This will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:4:23:If someone unintentionally sins and brings a female lamb without blemish as their sin offering,
3:4:24:They will lay their hand on the lamb's head and slaughter it at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered before the Lord.
3:4:25:The priest will dip his finger in the blood of the sin offering and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
3:4:26:He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar, just as he does with the peace offerings. This will make atonement for the person's sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:1:If someone unintentionally commits a sin by not obeying any of the Lord's commandments, they are guilty.
3:5:2:When they become aware of their sin, they must bring an offering to the Lord. This should be a female goat or lamb without any defects as a sin offering.
3:5:3:The priest will perform the necessary rituals to make amends for their sin and they will be forgiven.
3:5:4:If they can't afford a lamb, they may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons as an offering—one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
3:5:5:They must present them to the priest, who will first offer the one designated as the sin offering. He will wring its head from its neck but not sever it completely.
3:5:6:He will then sprinkle some of the blood on the side of the altar, and drain the rest at the base. This is the sin offering.
3:5:7:Next, he will prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the prescribed regulations. In this way, the priest will make atonement for their sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:8:If they can't afford two birds, they may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. They must not put oil or incense on it because it's a sin offering.
3:5:9:The priest will take a handful of the flour as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar with the other offerings made by fire. This is also a sin offering.
3:5:10:The remainder of the flour belongs to the priest, just like the grain offerings. In this way, the priest will make atonement for their sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:11:If someone unknowingly touches something unclean, like a dead animal or human, they are guilty of sin and must confess it.
3:5:12:To make amends, they must bring a ram without defects from their flock as a guilt offering. Its value will be determined according to the sanctuary shekel.
3:5:13:The priest will perform the necessary rituals to make atonement for their unintentional sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:14:If someone unknowingly sins by not giving the Lord the offerings due to Him, they are guilty.
3:5:15:When they become aware of their sin, they must bring a ram without defects as a guilt offering. Its value will be determined according to the sanctuary shekel.
3:5:16:They must also pay the amount they owe, plus an additional fifth, to the priest. The priest will then make atonement for them with the ram, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:17:If someone sins unintentionally by breaking any of the Lord's commandments, even if they were unaware of their sin, they are still guilty.
3:5:18:When they become aware of their sin, they must bring a ram without defects as a guilt offering. The priest will perform the necessary rituals to make atonement for their sin, and they will be forgiven.
3:5:19:This is a guilt offering because they have committed an offense against the Lord.
3:6:1:The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:2:"Give this command to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering must remain on the altar hearth throughout the night until morning, while the fire on the altar is kept burning.
3:6:3:The priest shall put on his linen garment and wear linen undergarments on his body. He shall remove the ashes from the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.
3:6:4:Then he shall take off his garments, put on other clothes, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
3:6:5:The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Each morning the priest shall add wood to the fire, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on top of it.
3:6:6:The fire must always be kept burning on the altar; it must never go out.
3:6:7:"And this is the law of the grain offering: Aaron's sons shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
3:6:8:The priest shall take a handful of the fine flour and oil of the grain offering, along with all the incense on it, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:6:9:The remaining part of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
3:6:10:"Every grain offering for a priest must be entirely burned; it must not be eaten."
3:6:11:The LORD also said to Moses,
3:6:12:"This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the LORD on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
3:6:13:It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain offering broken in pieces as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3:6:14:The son who is to succeed him as priest shall prepare it. It is the LORD's perpetual share and must be entirely burned.
3:6:15:Every grain offering for a priest must be entirely burned; it must not be eaten."
3:6:16:The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:6:17:"Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering must also be slaughtered before the LORD; it is most holy.
3:6:18:The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
3:6:19:Any male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy.
3:6:20:But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned up.
3:7:1:These are the instructions for the guilt offering, which is most holy:
3:7:2:At the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the guilt offering should also be killed. The priest will then sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
3:7:3:The fat from the guilt offering will be offered as well: the fat tail, the fat covering the inner organs, 
3:7:4:both kidneys with the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed along with the kidneys.
3:7:5:The priest will burn these parts on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord; it is a guilt offering.
3:7:6:Any male in a priest's family may eat it, but it must be eaten in the sanctuary area because it is most holy.
3:7:7:The same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering: They belong to the priest who uses them to make atonement.
3:7:8:The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
3:7:9:Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it,
3:7:10:and every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.
3:7:11:These are the regulations for the fellowship offering one may present to the Lord:
3:7:12:If they offer it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this thank offering they are to offer thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with oil, and thick loaves of the finest flour well-kneaded and with oil mixed in.
3:7:13:With their fellowship offering of thanksgiving they are to present an offering with thick loaves of bread made with yeast.
3:7:14:They are to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the Lord; it belongs to the priest who splashes the blood of the fellowship offering against the altar.
3:7:15:The meat of their fellowship offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; they must leave none of it till morning.
3:7:16:If, however, their offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day they offer it, but anything left over may be eaten on the next day.
3:7:17:Any meat of the sacrifice left over until the third day must be burned up.
3:7:18:If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, the one who offered it will not be accepted. It will not be reckoned to their credit, for it has become impure; the person who eats any of it will be held responsible.
3:7:19:Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.
3:7:20:But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the Lord, they must be cut off from their people.
3:7:21:Anyone who touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature that moves along the ground—and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the Lord must be cut off from their people.
3:7:22:The Lord said to Moses,
3:7:23:Tell the Israelites: Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats.
3:7:24:The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.
3:7:25:Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the Lord must be cut off from their people.
3:7:26:And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.
3:7:27:Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from their people.
3:7:28:The Lord said to Moses,
3:7:29:Tell the Israelites: Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the Lord is to bring part of it as their sacrifice to the Lord.
3:7:30:With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the Lord; they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the Lord as a wave offering.
3:7:31:The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
3:7:32:You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
3:7:33:The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.
3:7:34:From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.
3:7:35:This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the Lord that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the Lord as priests.
3:7:36:On the day they were anointed, the Lord commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come.
3:7:37:These are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,
3:7:38:which the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord.
3:8:1: The Lord told Moses,
3:8:2: "Take Aaron and his sons, along with their priestly garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.
3:8:3: Then gather the entire community at the entrance to the Tabernacle."
3:8:4: So Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the people assembled at the entrance to the Tabernacle.
3:8:5: Moses announced to them, "This is what the Lord has instructed us to do."
3:8:6: He brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
3:8:7: He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and placed the ephod on him. He then fastened the ephod with its skillfully woven waistband.
3:8:8: Next, he placed the breastpiece on Aaron and put the Urim and Thummim in it.
3:8:9: He set the turban on Aaron's head and attached the gold plate, the sacred emblem, to the front of the turban, just as the Lord had commanded him.
3:8:10: Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything in it, consecrating them.
3:8:11: He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils, as well as the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
3:8:12: He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, anointing him to consecrate him.
3:8:13: Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them, and fastened headbands on them, just as the Lord had commanded him.
3:8:14: He then brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:15: Moses slaughtered the bull, took some of its blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar, consecrating it so that atonement could be made.
3:8:16: He took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and burned them on the altar.
3:8:17: But the bull's flesh, hide, and dung he burned outside the camp, as the Lord had commanded him.
3:8:18: He brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:19: Moses slaughtered the ram, sprinkled its blood on the sides of the altar,
3:8:20: cut the ram into pieces, and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.
3:8:21: After washing the internal organs and the legs with water, Moses burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.
3:8:22: He brought the second ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
3:8:23: Moses slaughtered the ram, took some of its blood, and put it on Aaron's right earlobe, on his right thumb, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3:8:24: He also brought Aaron's sons forward, put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on their right thumbs, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood on the sides of the altar.
3:8:25: He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh.
3:8:26: From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one piece of unleavened bread, one cake made with oil, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
3:8:27: He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the Lord as a wave offering.
3:8:28: Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:8:29: Moses took the breast and waved it before the Lord as a wave offering from the ram of ordination, just as the Lord had commanded him.
3:8:30: He took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood on the altar, and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. In this way, he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and their garments.
3:8:31: Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tabernacle, and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: 'Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'
3:8:32: Burn up the remaining meat and bread.
3:8:33: You must not leave the entrance to the Tabernacle for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, because your ordination will last for seven days.
3:8:34: What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you.
3:8:35: You must stay at the entrance to the Tabernacle day and night for seven days, and do what the Lord requires, so that you will not die; for this is what I have been commanded."
3:8:36: So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses.
3:9:1:On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, along with the elders of Israel.
3:9:2:He told Aaron, "Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before the Lord."
3:9:3:Then he instructed the Israelites, "Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both one year old and without blemish—for a burnt offering,"
3:9:4:"and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, along with a grain offering mixed with oil. For today, the Lord will appear to you."
3:9:5:The people brought what Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the Lord.
3:9:6:Moses said, "This is what the Lord has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the Lord may appear to you."
3:9:7:Next, Moses told Aaron, "Approach the altar, offer your sin offering and burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and the people. Then present the offering for the people and make atonement for them, as the Lord has commanded."
3:9:8:Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
3:9:9:His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, putting some on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
3:9:10:He burned the fat, kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
3:9:11:The flesh and the hide, however, he burned outside the camp.
3:9:12:Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering.
3:9:13:His sons handed him the blood, which he splashed against the sides of the altar.
3:9:14:They also handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
3:9:15:He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
3:9:16:Aaron presented the people's offering. He took the male goat for the people's sin offering, slaughtered it, and made atonement for them, as he had done with the first sin offering.
3:9:17:He brought forward the burnt offering and offered it according to the proper procedure.
3:9:18:Next, he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.
3:9:19:He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people's peace offering sacrifice. His sons brought him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.
3:9:20:As for the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver—
3:9:21:they placed these fat portions on the breasts of the animals, and Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
3:9:22:Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the Lord as a wave offering, as Moses had commanded.
3:9:23:Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. After offering the sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, he stepped down.
3:9:24:Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came out, they blessed the people. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
3:9:25:Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
3:10:1:Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took a censer, placed fire in it, and added incense. They then offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them to do.
3:10:2:Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died in front of the Lord.
3:10:3:Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the Lord spoke of when he said, 'I will demonstrate my holiness among those who come near me, and I will be glorified before all the people.'" Aaron remained silent.
3:10:4:Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come forward and remove your relatives from the sanctuary area, and take them outside the camp."
3:10:5:So they approached and carried Nadab and Abihu away in their tunics, taking them outside the camp, as Moses had instructed.
3:10:6:Moses then told Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair become disheveled or tear your clothes, lest you die and bring wrath upon the entire congregation. Let your relatives, the whole house of Israel, mourn for those whom the Lord has destroyed by fire.
3:10:7:You must not leave the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die, because the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you." So they did as Moses ordered.
3:10:8:Then the Lord spoke to Aaron,
3:10:9:"Do not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, neither you nor your sons, when you enter the tent of meeting, so that you will not die. This is a lasting ordinance throughout your generations.
3:10:10:You must distinguish between the holy and the common, as well as between the clean and the unclean,
3:10:11:and teach the Israelites all the decrees that the Lord has given them through Moses."
3:10:12:Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the Lord, and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy.
3:10:13:Eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons' share of the food offerings presented to the Lord; this is what I have been commanded.
3:10:14:The breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented, you and your sons and daughters may eat in a ceremonially clean place. These parts have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites' fellowship offerings.
3:10:15:The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings to be waved before the Lord as a wave offering. This will be a perpetual portion for you and your descendants, as the Lord has commanded."
3:10:16:When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and discovered that it had been burned up, he became angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked,
3:10:17:"Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy, and God has given it to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the Lord.
3:10:18:Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded."
3:10:19:Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they sacrificed their sin offering and burnt offering before the Lord, but still these terrible things happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the Lord's sight?"
3:10:20:When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
3:11:1: The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:11:2: "Inform the Israelites about which animals they can eat.
3:11:3: Among all land animals, you may eat those that have a split hoof and chew the cud.
3:11:4: However, don't eat camels, even though they chew the cud, because their hooves are not split; they are unclean for you.
3:11:5: Rock badgers also shouldn't be eaten, as they chew the cud but lack split hooves; they are unclean for you.
3:11:6: Rabbits are another animal you must avoid, since they chew the cud but don't have split hooves; they are unclean for you.
3:11:7: Pigs are forbidden too, for while they have split hooves, they don't chew the cud; they are unclean for you.
3:11:8: Don't touch the carcasses of these unclean animals or eat their meat; they are unclean for you.
3:11:9: Concerning aquatic creatures, you may eat anything with fins and scales from the waters, whether in seas or rivers.
3:11:10: But all creatures lacking fins and scales in the seas and rivers, including swarming things and other living creatures in the water, are to be detested by you.
3:11:11: They shall remain detestable; you must not eat their meat, and you should avoid touching their carcasses.
3:11:12: All aquatic creatures without fins and scales are detestable to you.
3:11:13: These are the birds you must consider unclean and avoid eating: eagles, vultures, ospreys,
3:11:14: kites, falcons, buzzards,
3:11:15: all kinds of ravens,
3:11:16: ostriches, nighthawks, seagulls, hawks of any kind,
3:11:17: owls, cormorants, ibises,
3:11:18: water-hens, pelicans, vultures,
3:11:19: storks, herons, hoopoes, and bats.
3:11:20: All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
3:11:21: However, you may eat flying insects with jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground.
3:11:22: Among these, you can eat locusts, katydids, crickets, and grasshoppers.
3:11:23: But other flying insects with four legs are detestable to you.
3:11:24: By touching the carcass of these unclean animals, you will become unclean. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until evening.
3:11:25: If you carry the carcass of an unclean animal, you must wash your clothes and remain unclean until evening; then you will be clean.
3:11:26: Every animal with a split hoof that doesn't chew the cud is unclean for you. Anyone who touches them becomes unclean.
3:11:27: Any four-legged animal that walks on its paws is unclean for you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until evening.
3:11:28: If you pick up their carcasses, you must wash your clothes and remain unclean until evening; they are unclean for you.
3:11:29: These small creatures are unclean for you among those that move along the ground: weasels, rats, lizards of any kind,
3:11:30: geckos, monitor lizards, skinks, chameleons, and moles.
3:11:31: Among all the small creatures that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.
3:11:32: Anything on which one of these creatures falls when it dies will become unclean, including wooden utensils, clothing, leather, or sacks. It must be washed with water and will remain unclean until evening; then it will be clean.
3:11:33: If one of these creatures falls into a clay pot, everything in it will become unclean, and you must break the pot.
3:11:34: Any food that could be eaten but has touched water from an unclean pot is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk from such a pot is unclean.
3:11:35: Everything that the carcass of an unclean creature falls upon shall be unclean; ovens and cooking pots must be broken; they are unclean for you.
3:11:36: However, if a spring or cistern contains water, it remains clean. But whoever touches the carcass of an unclean creature in the water will become unclean.
3:11:37: If the carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean.
3:11:38: But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it becomes unclean for you.
3:11:39: If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening.
3:11:40: Whoever eats some of the carcass must wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening; the same applies to anyone who carries the carcass.
3:11:41: Every creature that moves along the ground is detestable; it must not be eaten.
3:11:42: You must not eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it crawls on its belly, walks on all fours, or has many legs; they are all detestable.
3:11:43: Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Don't make yourselves unclean with them or be made unclean by them.
3:11:44: For I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not defile yourselves with any of these creatures that move along the ground.
3:11:45: I am the LORD who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore, be holy, because I am holy.
3:11:46: These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves in the water, and every creature that moves along the ground.
3:11:47: They exist to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten."
3:12:1:When a woman gives birth to a baby boy, she will be unclean for seven days, just as she is during her monthly period.
3:12:2:On the eighth day, the baby's foreskin must be circumcised.
3:12:3:Afterward, the mother will spend 33 days getting purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or enter the sanctuary until her purification period is over.
3:12:4:If she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks, like during her period, and then spend 66 days getting purified from her bleeding.
3:12:5:When the days of her purification are complete, whether for a son or daughter, she must bring a one-year-old lamb as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove as a sin offering to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, where the priest will be.
3:12:6:The priest will offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law for a woman who gives birth to a child, male or female.
3:12:7:If she cannot afford a lamb, she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. The priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.
3:13:1:The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:13:2:"When someone has a swelling, rash, or a shiny spot on their skin that might be a sign of a serious skin disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or one of his sons.
3:13:3:The priest will examine the affected area on the person's skin. If the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, it is a contagious skin disease, and the priest must pronounce them unclean.
3:13:4:If the spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin-deep and the hair has not turned white, the priest will isolate the person for seven days.
3:13:5:On the seventh day, the priest will examine the person again. If the disease hasn't spread, the priest will isolate them for another seven days.
3:13:6:After the second seven-day period, the priest will examine the person once more. If the affected area has faded and hasn't spread, the priest will declare them clean; it's only a rash. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean.
3:13:7:But if the rash spreads after they've been examined by the priest and declared clean, they must return to the priest.
3:13:8:The priest will examine them again, and if the rash has spread, he will declare them unclean because of the contagious skin disease.
3:13:9:When someone has a contagious skin disease, they must be brought to the priest.
3:13:10:The priest will examine them, and if there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white and there's raw flesh in the swelling,
3:13:11:it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce them unclean. They don't need to be isolated because they are already unclean.
3:13:12:If the disease spreads over the person's body, covering them completely,
3:13:13:the priest will examine them, and if the disease covers their entire body, he will declare them clean, since it has all turned white.
3:13:14:But if raw flesh appears on them, they will be unclean.
3:13:15:The priest will see the raw flesh and pronounce them unclean; the raw flesh indicates they are unclean due to the skin disease.
3:13:16:If the raw flesh turns white again, they must return to the priest,
3:13:17:who will examine them. If the affected area has turned white, the priest will declare them clean, and they are no longer unclean.
3:13:18:When someone has a boil on their skin that heals,
3:13:19:and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, they must present themselves to the priest.
3:13:20:The priest will examine it, and if it appears to be more than skin-deep and the hair has turned white, he will pronounce them unclean. It is a contagious skin disease that has broken out where the boil was.
3:13:21:If the priest examines it and there's no white hair and it doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep, he will isolate the person for seven days.
3:13:22:If it spreads on the skin, the priest will declare them unclean; it is a contagious disease.
3:13:23:But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread, it's just a scar from the boil, and the priest will declare them clean.
3:13:24:When someone has a burn on their skin and the raw flesh becomes a reddish-white or white spot,
3:13:25:the priest will examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears to be more than skin-deep, it is a contagious disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce them unclean; it's a contagious skin disease.
3:13:26:If the priest examines it and there's no white hair and it doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep but is still reddish-white, he will isolate the person for seven days.
3:13:27:On the seventh day, the priest will examine them again. If it has spread on the skin, he will pronounce them unclean; it's a contagious skin disease.
3:13:28:But if the spot remains unchanged and hasn't spread on the skin but has faded, it's just a swelling from the burn. The priest will declare them clean, for it's only a scar from the burn.
3:13:29:If a man or woman has a sore on their head or chin,
3:13:30:the priest will examine the sore. If it appears to be more than skin-deep and there is yellow, thin hair in it, the priest will pronounce them unclean; it's a contagious skin disease on their head or chin.
3:13:31:If the priest examines the sore and it doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep but there's no black hair, he will isolate the person for seven days.
3:13:32:On the seventh day, the priest will examine the sore again. If it hasn't spread and there's no yellow hair and it doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep, 
3:13:33:the person must shave their hair around the sore, but not the hair within the sore itself. The priest will then isolate them for another seven days.
3:13:34:On the seventh day, the priest will examine the sore once more. If it hasn't spread and doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep, he will declare them clean. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean.
3:13:35:When someone has a white spot on their skin,
3:13:36:the priest will examine it. If the hair in the spot hasn't turned white and it doesn't appear to be more than skin-deep, the person has a harmless rash, and they are clean.
3:13:37:As for the person who loses their hair and becomes bald, they are clean.
3:13:38:If they lose their hair from the front of their head and develop a bald forehead, they are still clean.
3:13:39:But if there is a reddish-white sore on the bald head or forehead, it's a contagious skin disease breaking out on their head.
3:13:40:The priest will examine them, and if the swollen sore on their head or forehead is reddish-white and appears to be more than skin-deep, it's a contagious skin disease on their head, and they are unclean.
3:13:41:The person with such a contagious disease must wear torn clothes, leave their hair disheveled, cover their upper lip, and cry out, 'Unclean! Unclean!'
3:13:42:As long as they have the disease, they remain unclean. They must live alone and stay outside the camp.
3:13:43:When a contagious skin disease infects an article of clothing, whether it's made of wool or linen,
3:13:44:or found in the warp or woof of linen or wool, or in leather or anything made of leather,
3:13:45:the priest will examine the affected area. If it appears to be deeper than the surface, it's a contagious skin disease that has infected the clothing, leather, warp, woof, or any other item.
3:13:46:He must burn the item that has the disease, whether it's partially eaten away or completely damaged, for it is indeed a contagious skin disease and must be burned.
3:13:47:If the priest examines the item and the disease hasn't spread, he will order the contaminated object to be washed and isolated for seven days.
3:13:48:After it's been washed, the priest will examine it again. If the contaminated area hasn't changed, even if the disease hasn't spread, it's still unclean. The object must be burned, whether the contamination is on the inside or outside.
3:13:49:But if the priest sees that the contaminated area has faded after washing, he must cut it out of the clothing, leather, warp, or woof.
3:13:50:If it appears again in the item after it's been washed, it's a spreading disease and must be burned.
3:13:51:If the contamination disappears from the item after washing, the item is clean, and it must be washed again before it can be used.
3:14:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:14:2:"This is the law for those who have a skin disease when they are declared clean: They must be brought to the priest.
3:14:3:The priest will go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed of their skin disease,
3:14:4:the priest will order that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed.
3:14:5:The priest will command that one bird be killed in an earthenware pot over fresh water.
3:14:6:He will then take the live bird, along with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
3:14:7:Next, he will sprinkle the blood seven times on the person being cleansed from the skin disease, declare them clean, and release the live bird into the open field.
3:14:8:The one who has been cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean and may return to the camp; however, they must remain outside their tent for seven days.
3:14:9:On the seventh day, they must shave off all their hair again—head, beard, eyebrows, and body—and wash their clothes and bathe their body in water. After this, they will be clean.
3:14:10:On the eighth day, they must bring two male lambs without defects, a year-old ewe lamb without defects, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.
3:14:11:The priest who declares them clean will present them and their offerings before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
3:14:12:The priest will take one male lamb, along with the log of oil, and offer it as a guilt offering. He will then wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
3:14:13:He will slaughter the lamb in the holy place where sin and burnt offerings are slaughtered. The guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
3:14:14:The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being cleansed.
3:14:15:The priest will also take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his left hand.
3:14:16:He will then dip his right finger into the oil and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord.
3:14:17:Next, he will put some of the oil on the same places as the blood from the guilt offering—on the right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being cleansed.
3:14:18:The remaining oil in his palm will be placed on the head of the one being cleansed, making atonement for them before the Lord.
3:14:19:The priest will then offer the sin offering to make atonement for the one being cleansed from their uncleanness. Afterward, he will slaughter the burnt offering
3:14:20:and offer it on the altar, along with the grain offering, making atonement for them, and they will be clean.
3:14:21:If the person is poor and cannot afford these offerings, they must bring one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log of oil,
3:14:22:and two doves or two young pigeons, whichever they can afford—one for the sin offering and the other for the burnt offering.
3:14:23:On the eighth day of their cleansing, they will bring these offerings to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the Lord.
3:14:24:The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
3:14:25:He will slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and put some of its blood on the right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being cleansed.
3:14:26:He will pour some of the oil into the palm of his left hand,
3:14:27:and with his right finger, he will sprinkle the oil seven times before the Lord.
3:14:28:He will put some of the oil on the same places as the blood from the guilt offering—on the right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being cleansed.
3:14:29:The remaining oil in his palm will be placed on the head of the one being cleansed, making atonement for them before the Lord.
3:14:30:Then the priest will offer one of the doves or young pigeons, whichever the person can afford,
3:14:31:as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, along with the grain offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement before the Lord for the one being cleansed."
3:14:32:These are the regulations for anyone who has a skin disease and cannot afford the usual offerings for their cleansing.
3:14:33:The Lord also spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
3:14:34:"When you enter the land of Canaan that I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mold in a house in that land,
3:14:35:the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, 'I have seen something that looks like mold in my house.'
3:14:36:The priest will then order the house to be emptied before he goes in to examine the mold so that nothing in the house becomes unclean. Afterward, the priest will enter to inspect the house.
3:14:37:If he sees the mold on the walls and it appears to be deeper than the surface, with greenish or reddish depressions,
3:14:38:the priest will leave the house, close the door, and quarantine it for seven days.
3:14:39:On the seventh day, the priest will return to inspect the house. If the mold has spread on the walls,
3:14:40:he must order the contaminated stones to be removed and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.
3:14:41:The house must then be scraped inside, and the contaminated material must be dumped in an unclean place outside the town.
3:14:42:Finally, new stones will replace the old ones, and new clay will be used to replaster the house.
3:14:43:If the mold reappears after the stones have been replaced and the house has been scraped and replastered,
3:14:44:the priest will return and examine it. If the mold has spread, it is a destructive mold, and the house is unclean.
3:14:45:The house must be torn down—its stones, timbers, and all the plaster—and taken to an unclean place outside the town.
3:14:46:Anyone who enters the house while it is quarantined will be unclean until evening.
3:14:47:Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.
3:14:48:But if the priest inspects the house and the mold has not spread after it was replastered, he will declare the house clean because the mold is gone.
3:14:49:To purify the house, he will take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.
3:14:50:He will kill one bird over fresh water in an earthenware pot
3:14:51:and dip the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet yarn, and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water.
3:14:52:He will then sprinkle the house seven times with the blood mixture,
3:14:53:release the live bird into the open field, and make atonement for the house. It will be clean.
3:14:54:These are the regulations for any skin disease or mildew,
3:14:55:for a skin infection, scaly outbreak, or mold in clothing or a house,
3:14:56:and for swelling, rash, or discolored skin.
3:14:57:These instructions will help determine when something is clean or unclean. This is the law concerning skin diseases and mold."
3:15:1:Leviticus 15 begins with the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron. He tells them that when a man has a discharge from his body, it is unclean.
3:15:2:The discharge makes him unclean, and anything he lies or sits on becomes unclean as well.
3:15:3:If someone touches the man's bed, they must wash their clothes and bathe in water; they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:4:Whoever sits on an object the man has sat on must also wash their clothes and bathe in water, remaining unclean until evening.
3:15:5:Anyone who touches the man with the discharge must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:6:If the man with the discharge touches someone without first rinsing his hands in water, the person touched must wash their clothes and bathe in water, remaining unclean until evening.
3:15:7:When the man with the discharge touches an object or another person, the object or person becomes unclean. They must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:8:If the man with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, that person must wash their clothes and bathe in water, remaining unclean until evening.
3:15:9:Any saddle the man with the discharge rides on becomes unclean.
3:15:10:Whoever touches the saddle must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:11:If the man with the discharge touches an object without washing his hands, the object becomes unclean. Anyone who touches the object must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:12:If the man with the discharge touches a clay pot, it must be broken. Any wooden utensil he touches must be rinsed in water.
3:15:13:When the man with the discharge becomes clean from his discharge, he must count seven days for his cleansing. He must wash his clothes and bathe his body in fresh water, and then he will be clean.
3:15:14:On the eighth day, he must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
3:15:15:The priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement for the man before the Lord for his discharge.
3:15:16:When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body in water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3:15:17:Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed in water, and it will be unclean until evening.
3:15:18:When a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both must bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:19:When a woman has her menstrual period, she will be unclean for seven days. Anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening.
3:15:20:Anything she lies or sits on during her period will be unclean.
3:15:21:Whoever touches her bed must wash their clothes and bathe in water, remaining unclean until evening.
3:15:22:Anyone who touches any object she has sat on must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.
3:15:23:If an object is touched that she has sat or lain on during her period, the person who touches it will be unclean until evening.
3:15:24:If a man lies with her and her menstrual blood touches him, he will be unclean for seven days. Any bed he lies on will also become unclean.
3:15:25:When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days outside of her regular period or if her discharge continues beyond her period, she will be unclean as long as the discharge continues.
3:15:26:Any bed she lies on and anything she sits on during this time will be unclean, just like during her period.
3:15:27:Whoever touches these things must wash their clothes and bathe in water, remaining unclean until evening.
3:15:28:When the woman is cleansed from her discharge, she must count seven days, and after that, she will be clean.
3:15:29:On the eighth day, she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
3:15:30:The priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement for her before the Lord for her unclean discharge.
3:15:31:This is the law for any man who has a discharge or an emission of semen, making him unclean,
3:15:32:and for any woman during her menstrual period, as well as for any man or woman with a discharge, whether it is from the man or the woman, and for the man who lies with an unclean woman.
3:16:1:The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron's two sons when they approached the Lord and died.
3:16:2:He said, "Tell your brother Aaron not to enter the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark whenever he pleases, or he may die because I appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.
3:16:3:Only in this way can Aaron enter the Holy Place: by offering a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering.
3:16:4:He must put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he must tie the linen sash around him and wear the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.
3:16:5:From the Israelite community, he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
3:16:6:Aaron will offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
3:16:7:He must then take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
3:16:8:Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat.
3:16:9:Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the Lord and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
3:16:10:But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.
3:16:11:Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he shall slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
3:16:12:He must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and bring them behind the curtain.
3:16:13:He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so that he will not die.
3:16:14:He is to take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
3:16:15:Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
3:16:16:In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He is to do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
3:16:17:No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household and the whole community of Israel.
3:16:18:Then he shall come out to the altar that is before the Lord and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
3:16:19:He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
3:16:20:When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat.
3:16:21:He is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat's head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task.
3:16:22:The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.
3:16:23:Then Aaron is to enter the tent of meeting, take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Most Holy Place, and leave them there.
3:16:24:He shall bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and the burnt offering for the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.
3:16:25:He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
3:16:26:The man who released the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward, he may come into the camp.
3:16:27:The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh, and intestines are to be burned up.
3:16:28:The one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward, he may come into the camp.
3:16:29:"This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you must deny yourselves and not do any work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you.
3:16:30:On this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Then, before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins.
3:16:31:It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.
3:16:32:The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement. He is to put on the sacred linen garments
3:16:33:and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting and the altar, and for the priests and all the members of the community.
3:16:34:This is to be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites." And it was done, as the Lord commanded Moses.
3:17:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:17:2:"Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, and tell them that this is what the Lord has commanded:
3:17:3:If anyone from the house of Israel slaughters an ox, lamb, or goat, whether inside or outside the camp,
3:17:4:and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting as an offering to the Lord before His dwelling place, that person shall be considered guilty of bloodshed; he has shed blood and must be cut off from his people.
3:17:5:The reason for this is so the Israelites will bring their sacrifices, which they have been offering in the open fields, to the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They must present them to the priest, who will offer them as peace offerings to the Lord.
3:17:6:The priest will then sprinkle the blood on the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
3:17:7:They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat-demons, with whom they have been prostituting themselves. This is a permanent statute for them throughout their generations.
3:17:8:Tell them that if anyone, whether native-born or foreigner, offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
3:17:9:without bringing it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to offer it to the Lord, that person must be cut off from his people.
3:17:10:Moreover, if any of the Israelites or any foreigner living among them consumes blood in any form, I will turn against that person and cut him off from his people.
3:17:11:For the life of a creature is in its blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your lives; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.
3:17:12:Therefore, I say to the Israelites, 'No one among you, whether native-born or foreigner, shall consume blood.'
3:17:13:If any of the Israelites or foreigners living among them hunts a wild animal or bird that may be eaten, they must drain its blood and cover it with earth.
3:17:14:For the life of every creature is in its blood. That is why I have told the Israelites, 'You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off.'
3:17:15:Any person, whether native-born or foreigner, who eats an animal found dead or torn by wild beasts must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening; then he will become clean.
3:17:16:But if he does not wash his clothes or bathe himself, he will bear the consequences of his sin."
3:18:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:18:2:"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, I am the Lord your God.
3:18:3:You must not follow the practices of Egypt, where you used to live, nor of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not imitate their customs.
3:18:4:Obey my rules and follow them. I am the Lord your God.
3:18:5:Keep my decrees and laws, for those who do so will find life through them. I am the Lord.
3:18:6:No one should approach a close relative to have sexual relations; I am the Lord.
3:18:7:Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have relations with her.
3:18:8:Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife, as that would shame your father.
3:18:9:Do not have sexual relations with your sister, whether she is your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, regardless if she was born in the same household or elsewhere.
3:18:10:Do not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, for that would be a disgrace to your own family.
3:18:11:Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.
3:18:12:Do not have sexual relations with your father's sister; she is your father's close relative.
3:18:13:Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister, for she is your mother's close relative.
3:18:14:Do not dishonor your father's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.
3:18:15:Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; you must not have relations with her.
3:18:16:Do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife; that would dishonor your brother.
3:18:17:Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sexual relations with her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness.
3:18:18:Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.
3:18:19:Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.
3:18:20:Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor's wife and defile yourself with her.
3:18:21:Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.
3:18:22:Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.
3:18:23:Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.
3:18:24:Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.
3:18:25:Even the land was defiled, so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
3:18:26:You must obey my laws and decrees. Do not commit any of these detestable things—not native-born Israelites nor the foreigners residing among you.
3:18:27:For the people of the land who were before you did all these detestable things, and the land became defiled.
3:18:28:And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
3:18:29:Everyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people.
3:18:30:Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came, and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God."
3:19:1:The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3:19:2:"Speak to the entire Israelite community and tell them: Be holy, for I, the LORD your God, am holy.
3:19:3:Every one of you shall respect your mother and father, and keep my Sabbaths; I am the LORD your God.
3:19:4:Do not turn to idols or make gods of cast metal for yourselves; I am the LORD your God.
3:19:5:When you offer a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, do so in a manner that is acceptable, so it may be received favorably.
3:19:6:The sacrifice must be eaten on the day it is offered or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned up.
3:19:7:If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is impure and will not be accepted.
3:19:8:Anyone who eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the LORD; that person must be cut off from their people.
3:19:9:When you harvest your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
3:19:10:Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the fallen grapes; leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the LORD your God.
3:19:11:Do not steal, lie, or deceive one another.
3:19:12:Do not swear falsely by my name, profaning the name of your God; I am the LORD.
3:19:13:Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight.
3:19:14:Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but fear your God; I am the LORD.
3:19:15:Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly.
3:19:16:Do not spread slander among your people. Do not stand idly by when your neighbor's life is threatened; I am the LORD.
3:19:17:Do not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly, so you will not share in their guilt.
3:19:18:Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.
3:19:19:Keep my decrees. Do not mate different kinds of animals. Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material.
3:19:20:If a man sleeps with a female slave who is promised to another man but who has not been ransomed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. Yet they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.
3:19:21:The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance of the tent of meeting for a guilt offering to the LORD.
3:19:22:With the ram of the guilt offering, the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD for the sin he has committed, and his sin will be forgiven.
3:19:23:When you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as forbidden. For three years you are to consider it forbidden; it must not be eaten.
3:19:24:In the fourth year, all its fruit will be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD.
3:19:25:But in the fifth year, you may eat its fruit. In this way, your harvest will be increased; I am the LORD your God.
3:19:26:Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it. Do not practice divination or seek omens.
3:19:27:Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.
3:19:28:Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves; I am the LORD.
3:19:29:Do not degrade your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will turn to prostitution and be filled with wickedness.
3:19:30:Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary; I am the LORD.
3:19:31:Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them; I am the LORD your God.
3:19:32:Stand up in the presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly, and revere your God; I am the LORD.
3:19:33:Do not mistreat foreigners residing among you, but treat them as native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
3:19:34:Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length, weight, or quantity.
3:19:35:Use honest scales and honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin; I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt.
3:19:36:Keep all my decrees and all my laws and follow them; I am the LORD."
3:20:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:20:2:"Tell the Israelites that anyone who offers their children to Molech must be put to death. The people of the community shall stone them.
3:20:3:I will turn against those who offer their children to Molech and cut them off from their people because they have defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.
3:20:4:If the community ignores someone offering their children to Molech and doesn't execute them,
3:20:5:I will turn against that person and their family, cutting them off from their people along with all who follow them in prostituting themselves to Molech.
3:20:6:Any person who consults mediums or spiritists, prostituting themselves with them, I will turn against them and cut them off from their people.
3:20:7:Consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am the Lord your God.
3:20:8:Keep my decrees and follow them, for I am the Lord who makes you holy.
3:20:9:Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death; they have brought shame upon their parents and are responsible for their own death.
3:20:10:If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.
3:20:11:A man who sleeps with his father's wife has disgraced his father, and both must be put to death; they are responsible for their own deaths.
3:20:12:If a man sleeps with his daughter-in-law, both must be put to death. They have committed a perversion and are responsible for their own deaths.
3:20:13:If a man lies with another man as with a woman, both have committed an abomination and must be put to death; they are responsible for their own deaths.
3:20:14:If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is wickedness. They must all be burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you.
3:20:15:If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and the animal must also be killed.
3:20:16:If a woman approaches an animal to mate with it, both the woman and the animal must be killed; they are responsible for their own deaths.
3:20:17:If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off from their people in the sight of their relatives because they have dishonored their family.
3:20:18:If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has uncovered it. Both must be cut off from their people.
3:20:19:Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister or your father's sister, for that would dishonor a close relative. Both of you would bear the guilt.
3:20:20:If a man sleeps with his aunt, he has dishonored his uncle. They will bear their sin and die childless.
3:20:21:If a man marries his brother's wife, it is an act of impurity; he has dishonored his brother, and they will remain childless.
3:20:22:Observe all my decrees and laws, so that the land where I am bringing you to live will not vomit you out.
3:20:23:Do not follow the practices of the nations I am driving out before you, for they did all these things, and I abhorred them.
3:20:24:But I have said to you, 'You will inherit their land; I will give it to you as a possession, a land flowing with milk and honey.' I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.
3:20:25:Distinguish between clean and unclean animals and birds. Do not defile yourselves by any animal or bird or anything that moves along the ground—those that I have set apart as unclean for you.
3:20:26:Be holy to me, for I, the Lord, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own people.
3:20:27:A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You shall stone them; their blood will be on their own heads."
3:21:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:21:2:"Tell Aaron and his sons, the priests, that they must avoid contact with any dead body among their people,
3:21:3:except for their immediate family members - mother, father, son, daughter, or sibling.
3:21:4:If a priest has an unmarried sister, he may also become unclean for her when she dies.
3:21:5:A priest must not shave his head bald or trim the edges of his beard, nor make cuts on his body.
3:21:6:They must remain holy to their God and not profane His name, for they present offerings by fire to the Lord, the food of their God, so they must be holy.
3:21:7:A priest should not marry a woman who is a prostitute, defiled, or divorced from her husband, because he is holy to his God.
3:21:8:You must consider him holy, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I, the Lord, who sanctify you, am holy.
3:21:9:If a priest's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she dishonors her father; she must be burned in the fire.
3:21:10:The high priest, who has been anointed with the sacred anointing oil and wears the priestly garments, must not let his hair hang loose or tear his clothes.
3:21:11:He must not enter a place where there is a dead body; he must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother.
3:21:12:He must not leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.
3:21:13:The high priest must marry a virgin.
3:21:14:He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, a defiled woman, or a prostitute, but only a virgin from his own people,
3:21:15:so that he does not profane his offspring among his people, for I am the Lord who sanctifies him."
3:21:16:Moses told all this to Aaron and his sons, and to all the Israelites.
3:22:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:2:Tell Aaron and his sons to treat the sacred offerings of the Israelites with reverence, so they do not desecrate my holy name; I am the Lord.
3:22:3:Remind them that if any descendant of Aaron is unclean and approaches the sacred offerings dedicated to me by the Israelites, he will be cut off from my presence. I am the Lord.
3:22:4:No descendant of Aaron who has a skin disease or a discharge may eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. Anyone who touches something made unclean by a dead body, or a man who has had an emission of semen,
3:22:5:or anyone who touches a creature that makes him unclean, or a person who makes him unclean—whatever the uncleanness may be—
3:22:6:that person who touches any such thing will be unclean until evening, and must not eat the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself in water.
3:22:7:When the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward, he may eat the sacred offerings, for they are his food.
3:22:8:He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the Lord.
3:22:9:They must observe my charge, so they do not bear the guilt for sin and die because they treated it with contempt. I am the Lord, who makes them holy.
3:22:10:No outsider shall eat the sacred offering, nor shall the guest of a priest or his hired worker.
3:22:11:But if a priest buys a slave as his property, or if a slave is born in his household, they may eat his food.
3:22:12:If a priest's daughter marries an outsider, she may not eat from the sacred contributions.
3:22:13:But if the priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced and has no child, and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat her father's food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it.
3:22:14:If anyone eats the sacred offering by mistake, they must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of its value.
3:22:15:The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings of the Israelites presented to the Lord,
3:22:16:by allowing them to bear the guilt for eating their sacred offerings; for I am the Lord who makes them holy.
3:22:17:Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:18:Tell Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites that when anyone brings a fellowship offering to the Lord from the herd or flock, it must be without defect to be accepted; there must be no blemish.
3:22:19:You shall offer a male without blemish from the cattle, sheep, or goats.
3:22:20:Do not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
3:22:21:When anyone offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there must be no defect in it.
3:22:22:Blind, injured, maimed, or having a running sore, festering rash, or scabs—you shall not offer these to the Lord or put any of them on the altar as an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:22:23:As for an ox or a sheep that has any part too long or too short, you may present it as a freewill offering, but it will not be accepted for a vow.
3:22:24:You must not offer to the Lord an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut. You must not do this in your own land,
3:22:25:and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, for they are deformed and have defects.
3:22:26:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:22:27:When a calf, lamb, or goat is born, it shall remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:22:28:Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
3:22:29:When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the Lord, offer it so that it may be accepted on your behalf.
3:22:30:It must be eaten on the same day; do not leave any of it until morning. I am the Lord.
3:22:31:Keep my commands and follow them. I am the Lord.
3:22:32:Do not profane my holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the Lord, who makes you holy
3:22:33:and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.
3:23:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:2:"Speak to the Israelites and tell them about the appointed festivals that you must celebrate as sacred assemblies. These are my special times.
3:23:3:For six days you may work, but on the seventh day it is a complete rest, a sacred assembly. You must not do any work; it's a Sabbath to the Lord wherever you live.
3:23:4:These are the appointed festivals of the Lord, the sacred assemblies you must proclaim at their proper times:
3:23:5:The Lord's Passover begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
3:23:6:On the fifteenth day of the same month starts the Festival of Unleavened Bread in honor of the Lord. For seven days you must eat bread without yeast.
3:23:7:On the first day of the festival, hold a sacred assembly and don't do any regular work.
3:23:8:Offer food to the Lord for seven days. On the seventh day, hold another sacred assembly and refrain from working.
3:23:9:Then the Lord told Moses,
3:23:10:"Tell the Israelites, 'When you enter the land I am giving you and harvest its grain, bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.
3:23:11:He will wave the sheaf before the Lord so that you may be accepted; the priest shall wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
3:23:12:On the day you wave the sheaf, offer a one-year-old male lamb without defect as a burnt offering to the Lord.
3:23:13:With the lamb, present an offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a food offering to the Lord, along with a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.
3:23:14:You must not eat any bread, roasted grain, or fresh kernels until you have presented this offering to your God. This is a permanent law for generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:15:Starting from the day after the Sabbath, the day you bring the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks.
3:23:16:Count fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.
3:23:17:Bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the Lord.
3:23:18:Along with the bread, offer seven one-year-old male lambs without defect, one young bull, and two rams as burnt offerings to the Lord, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
3:23:19:Also, sacrifice one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering.
3:23:20:The priest will wave the lambs with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the Lord, together with the two lambs. They are holy and belong to the Lord for the priest.
3:23:21:On that same day, proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is a permanent statute for generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:22:When you harvest the land, don't reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner residing among you. I am the Lord your God."
3:23:23:The Lord said to Moses,
3:23:24:"Tell the Israelites, 'In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you must observe a day of complete rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts.
3:23:25:Do not do any regular work, but present an offering made by fire to the Lord.'"
3:23:26:Again, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:27:"On the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred assembly and humble yourselves; present an offering made by fire to the Lord.
3:23:28:Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement when atonement is made for you before the Lord your God.
3:23:29:Anyone who doesn't humble themselves on that day must be cut off from their people.
3:23:30:I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that day.
3:23:31:You must not do any work at all. This is a permanent law for generations to come, wherever you live.
3:23:32:It is a complete day of rest for you, and you must humble yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening, you are to observe your Sabbath."
3:23:33:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:23:34:"Tell the Israelites, 'On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Lord's Festival of Tabernacles begins, and it lasts for seven days.
3:23:35:The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work.
3:23:36:For seven days, present offerings made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day, hold a sacred assembly and present an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is the closing special assembly; do no regular work.
3:23:37:These are the appointed festivals of the Lord that you shall proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting offerings made by fire to the Lord—burnt offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings, each on its proper day.
3:23:38:This is in addition to the Sabbaths of the Lord and your gifts, all your vowed offerings, and all the freewill offerings you give to the Lord.
3:23:39:So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the Lord for seven days; the first day is a day of complete rest, and the eighth day also is a day of complete rest.
3:23:40:On the first day, gather branches from magnificent trees—palm fronds, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook—and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.
3:23:41:Celebrate this as a festival to the Lord for seven days each year. This is a permanent law for generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
3:23:42:Live in temporary shelters for seven days. All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters,
3:23:43:so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.'"
3:23:44:So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the Lord.
3:24:1:Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
3:24:2:"Command the Israelites to bring you pure olive oil for the lamps so that they may burn continuously.
3:24:3:Aaron shall maintain the lamps outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting from evening until morning before Yahweh continually. This is a permanent statute throughout your generations.
3:24:4:He shall arrange the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh regularly.
3:24:5:Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.
3:24:6:Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before Yahweh.
3:24:7:Place pure frankincense along with each row as a memorial portion, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
3:24:8:Every Sabbath day, Aaron shall set the bread in order before Yahweh continually; it is an everlasting covenant on behalf of the Israelites.
3:24:9:The bread will belong to Aaron and his sons, who shall eat it in a holy place, for it is most holy to him from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, a perpetual due."
3:24:10:Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel. This son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel fought together in the camp.
3:24:11:The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name, cursing it. They brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
3:24:12:They put him in custody until Yahweh's decision could be made clear to them.
3:24:13:Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
3:24:14:"Bring the one who cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him.
3:24:15:Tell the Israelites: 'Anyone who curses their God shall bear their sin.
3:24:16:Whoever blasphemes the Name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death. The entire congregation must stone him. Whether foreigner or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he shall be executed.
3:24:17:If anyone takes a human life, that person must be put to death.
3:24:18:Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life.
3:24:19:If anyone injures their neighbor, whatever they have done must be done to them:
3:24:20:Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The same injury they inflicted on another shall be inflicted on them.
3:24:21:Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death.
3:24:22:You shall have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am Yahweh your God.'"
3:24:23:Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. The Israelites did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
3:25:1:The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
3:25:2:Tell the Israelites that when they enter the land I am giving them, they must let it rest every seventh year, a Sabbath for the land.
3:25:3:For six years you may sow your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops,
3:25:4:but in the seventh year, there shall be a time of complete rest for the land, a Sabbath dedicated to the Lord. You must not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.
3:25:5:Do not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. The land should have a year of rest.
3:25:6:The produce of the land during its Sabbath will provide food for you, your male and female servants, and the hired laborers and temporary residents who live among you,
3:25:7:as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its yield shall be shared by everyone.
3:25:8:Count off seven sets of seven years, totaling forty-nine years.
3:25:9:Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, which is the Day of Atonement, sound the trumpet throughout the land.
3:25:10:Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan.
3:25:11:The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow, nor reap the aftergrowth, nor harvest the unpruned vines.
3:25:12:For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You may only eat the produce directly from the field.
3:25:13:In this Year of Jubilee, everyone is to return to their own property.
3:25:14:If you sell land to any of your fellow Israelites or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other.
3:25:15:You are to buy from your neighbor based on the number of years since the last jubilee. He is to sell to you based on the number of years left for harvesting crops.
3:25:16:When there are many years, you shall increase the price, and when there are few years, you shall decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops.
3:25:17:Do not cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am the Lord your God.
3:25:18:Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.
3:25:19:The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
3:25:20:You may wonder, "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?"
3:25:21:I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
3:25:22:While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
3:25:23:The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and temporary residents.
3:25:24:Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
3:25:25:If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold.
3:25:26:If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,
3:25:27:they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then return to their property.
3:25:28:But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the jubilee, and they can then go back to their property.
3:25:29:Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time, the seller may redeem it.
3:25:30:If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and their descendants. It is not to be returned in the jubilee.
3:25:31:But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they shall be returned in the jubilee.
3:25:32:The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.
3:25:33:So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.
3:25:34:But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
3:25:35:If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner or temporary resident, so they can continue to live among you.
3:25:36:Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.
3:25:37:You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.
3:25:38:I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
3:25:39:If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves.
3:25:40:They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
3:25:41:Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors.
3:25:42:Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
3:25:43:Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but fear your God.
3:25:44:Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves.
3:25:45:You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.
3:25:46:You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
3:25:47:If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner's clan,
3:25:48:they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them:
3:25:49:An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves.
3:25:50:They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years.
3:25:51:If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them.
3:25:52:If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.
3:25:53:They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly.
3:25:54:Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,
3:25:55:for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
3:26:1:If you follow my rules and keep my commandments, I will bless you.
3:26:2:I will provide rain at the right time, so your land will produce crops and your trees will bear fruit.
3:26:3:Your harvest will last until the grape harvest, and the grape harvest will last until it's time to plant again. You'll have plenty of food to eat and live securely in your land.
3:26:4:I will bring peace to your country, and you'll be able to sleep without fear. I will remove dangerous animals and protect you from enemy attacks.
3:26:5:You'll chase down your enemies, and they will fall before you in battle.
3:26:6:I will look favorably on you, making you fruitful and increasing your numbers. I will uphold my covenant with you.
3:26:7:You'll eat what you stored from the previous year, making room for the new harvest.
3:26:8:I will live among you and be your God, and you will be my people.
3:26:9:I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, freeing you from slavery, and breaking the chains that bound you.
3:26:10:Now, you can stand tall, because I am the Lord your God.
3:26:11:But if you don't listen to me and refuse to follow my commandments,
3:26:12:I will bring disaster upon you, causing sickness and defeat by your enemies. You will sow your seeds in vain, as your enemies will consume the harvest.
3:26:13:I will turn against you, and you will be defeated by those who hate you. Your enemies will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is chasing you.
3:26:14:And if you still don't listen to me and continue to disobey my commands,
3:26:15:I will punish you even more, striking you with terrible afflictions, fever, and disease that will destroy your eyesight and drain away your life. You won't have success when planting your seeds, and your enemies will eat what you've grown.
3:26:16:I will strike you with fear, making you weak and vulnerable to your enemies, who will rule over you. You will run away, even if no one is pursuing you.
3:26:17:If after all this, you still refuse to listen to me, I will increase the punishment seven times for your sins.
3:26:18:I will break your stubborn pride and make the sky like iron and the ground like bronze.
3:26:19:Your strength will be spent in vain, as the land won't produce crops and the trees won't bear fruit.
3:26:20:If you continue to resist and ignore me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times, according to your sins.
3:26:21:I will send wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your population until your roads are deserted.
3:26:22:If you still don't change your ways and remain hostile toward me,
3:26:23:I will respond with hostility and strike you down seven times for your sins.
3:26:24:I will bring a sword against you to avenge the breaking of our covenant. When you gather in your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you'll be handed over to your enemies.
3:26:25:When I cut off your food supply, ten women will bake bread in one oven, rationing it out by weight. You'll eat, but you won't be satisfied.
3:26:26:If after all this, you still don't listen to me and continue in hostility,
3:26:27:I will show my anger and discipline you seven times more for your sins.
3:26:28:I will cause you to eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters.
3:26:29:I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols. I will reject you.
3:26:30:I will devastate your cities and make your sanctuaries desolate. I will refuse to smell the pleasing aroma of your offerings.
3:26:31:I will turn your land into a desolation, and your enemies who live there will be appalled.
3:26:32:I will scatter you among the nations and draw my sword to chase you. Your land will become a wasteland, and your cities will lie in ruins.
3:26:33:Then the land will enjoy its Sabbath years as it lies desolate while you are in exile. It will finally rest and enjoy the Sabbaths it missed.
3:26:34:During the time it lies desolate, the land will make up for the Sabbaths it didn't rest while you lived there.
3:26:35:For those of you who survive, I will fill your hearts with fear in the lands of your enemies. The sound of a windblown leaf will put you to flight, and you'll flee as if running from a sword. You'll stumble over one another even when no one is pursuing you.
3:26:36:You will have no power to stand before your enemies.
3:26:37:You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.
3:26:38:Those who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
3:26:39:But if they confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors, admitting their unfaithfulness and hostility toward me,
3:26:40:I will remember my covenant with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, and I will remember the land.
3:26:41:The land will be abandoned by them and enjoy its Sabbaths while lying desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and treated my decrees with contempt.
3:26:42:Yet, despite all this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or despise them so completely as to destroy them and break my covenant with them. For I am the Lord their God.
3:26:43:Instead, I will remember the covenant I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt in the sight of the nations, to be their God. I am the Lord.
3:26:44:These are the decrees, laws, and regulations that the Lord established between himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
3:27:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
3:27:2:Speak to the Israelites and tell them that when someone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the Lord, the value of that person should be assessed.
3:27:3:For males aged twenty to sixty years old, the value is fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3:27:4:If it's a female, her value is thirty shekels.
3:27:5:For those between five and twenty years old, the value for a male is twenty shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
3:27:6:For children between one month and five years old, the value for a male is five shekels of silver, and for a female, three shekels.
3:27:7:For those who are sixty years old or older, the value for a male is fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
3:27:8:If someone is too poor to pay the set amount, they must present themselves before the priest, who will determine their value based on what they can afford.
3:27:9:If the vow concerns an animal that may be offered as an offering to the Lord, every such animal given to the Lord becomes holy.
3:27:10:One must not exchange or substitute another animal for it; if they do, both the original and its substitute become holy.
3:27:11:If the animal is unclean and cannot be offered to the Lord, it must be presented to the priest,
3:27:12:who will assess its value based on its worth. Once the priest has determined its value,
3:27:13:the person making the vow may choose to redeem the animal by adding one-fifth of its value in silver to the assessed amount.
3:27:14:If they don't redeem it, the animal will be sold for its assessed value.
3:27:15:When someone dedicates their house as holy to the Lord, the priest will determine its value based on its worth. If they want to redeem it, they must add one-fifth to the assessed value.
3:27:16:If a person dedicates part of their land to the Lord, its value should be calculated according to the seed required for it: fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed.
3:27:17:If the dedication is made during the Year of Jubilee, the full value applies.
3:27:18:But if it's dedicated after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the value based on the remaining years until the next Year of Jubilee, and the price will be reduced accordingly.
3:27:19:If the one who dedicated the land wishes to redeem it, they must add one-fifth to the assessed value, and it will return to them.
3:27:20:If they don't redeem the land or if it's sold to someone else, it can no longer be redeemed.
3:27:21:When the land is released in the Year of Jubilee, it becomes holy to the Lord like a devoted field; it will become the property of the priests.
3:27:22:If someone dedicates a field they've purchased, which is not part of their ancestral land,
3:27:23:the priest will calculate its value based on the years remaining until the next Year of Jubilee, and that amount must be paid on the day of dedication as a holy offering to the Lord.
3:27:24:In the Year of Jubilee, the field will return to the original owner from whom it was purchased, the one whose land it was part of.
3:27:25:All valuations must be made according to the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs equal one shekel.
3:27:26:The firstborn among animals already belongs to the Lord, so no one may dedicate a firstborn, whether it's a clean or unclean animal.
3:27:27:If it's an unclean animal, it can be redeemed at its assessed value plus one-fifth. If it's not redeemed, it will be sold for its assessed value.
3:27:28:Nothing that someone has devoted to destruction for the Lord, whether human or animal, or part of their inherited land, can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the Lord.
3:27:29:No person who has been devoted to destruction can be ransomed; they must be put to death.
3:27:30:All the tithe of the land, whether from crops or fruit trees, belongs to the Lord; it is holy to the Lord.
3:27:31:If someone wants to redeem any of their tithe, they must add one-fifth to its value.
3:27:32:The tithe of the herd and flock, every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd's rod, will be holy to the Lord.
3:27:33:The owner must not pick out the good from the bad or make any substitutions. If they do substitute one animal for another, both the original and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.
3:27:34:These are the commandments that the Lord gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
