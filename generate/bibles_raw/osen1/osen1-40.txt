40:1:1:This is the record of the lineage of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
40:1:2:Abraham was the father of Isaac, who fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
40:1:3:Judah had Perez and Zerah with Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, who fathered Ram.
40:1:4:Ram was the father of Amminadab, who fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.
40:1:5:Salmon had Boaz with Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed with Ruth. Obed fathered Jesse,
40:1:6:and Jesse was the father of King David. David fathered Solomon with Uriah's wife.
40:1:7:Solomon fathered Rehoboam, who fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.
40:1:8:Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, who fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah.
40:1:9:Uzziah fathered Jotham, who fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
40:1:10:Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, who fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.
40:1:11:Josiah had Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.
40:1:12:After the exile, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, who fathered Zerubbabel.
40:1:13:Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, who fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.
40:1:14:Azor fathered Zadok, who fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.
40:1:15:Eliud was the father of Eleazar, who fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.
40:1:16:Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary. Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called Christ.
40:1:17:So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen from the exile to Christ.
40:1:18:Here's the story of Jesus Christ's birth: Mary, his mother, was engaged to Joseph, but before they got married, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
40:1:19:Joseph, her fiancé, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to break off the engagement quietly.
40:1:20:As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40:1:21:She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
40:1:22:All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
40:1:23:"Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us."
40:1:24:When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife,
40:1:25:but he did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.
40:2:1:After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, during the time of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem.
40:2:2:"Where is the newborn king of the Jews?" they asked. "We saw his star as it rose and have come to worship him."
40:2:3:King Herod was troubled when he heard this news, and so was all of Jerusalem.
40:2:4:He gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people to inquire about where the Christ would be born.
40:2:5:They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote:
40:2:6:'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"
40:2:7:Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
40:2:8:He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the child. When you find him, report back to me, so that I too may go and worship him."
40:2:9:After hearing the king, they went on their way. And the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
40:2:10:When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
40:2:11:Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and fell down to worship him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
40:2:12:Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they took a different route back to their country.
40:2:13:After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
40:2:14:So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt.
40:2:15:They stayed there until the death of Herod, fulfilling what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."
40:2:16:When Herod realized he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious. He ordered the massacre of all boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.
40:2:17:Then the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled:
40:2:18:"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."
40:2:19:After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
40:2:20:saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
40:2:21:Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
40:2:22:But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,
40:2:23:and settled in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."
40:3:1:Around that time, John the Baptist came on the scene, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
40:3:2:"Change your hearts and lives," he said, "because the kingdom of heaven is near!"
40:3:3:John was the one spoken about by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "A voice calling out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord; make his paths straight.'"
40:3:4:John wore clothes made from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
40:3:5:People from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the region around the Jordan went to him,
40:3:6:confessing their sins, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
40:3:7:But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40:3:8:Prove your repentance by producing good fruit.
40:3:9:And don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!
40:3:10:Even now, the ax is poised to cut down the trees that don't produce good fruit. Such trees will be thrown into the fire.
40:3:11:I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am. I'm not even worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
40:3:12:He holds a winnowing fork in his hand and will clear his threshing floor. He'll gather his wheat into the barn, but he'll burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."
40:3:13:Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
40:3:14:But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
40:3:15:Jesus replied, "Allow it for now, because this is the right way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John agreed to baptize him.
40:3:16:After Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on him.
40:3:17:A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
40:4:1:Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
40:4:2:After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he felt hungry.
40:4:3:The tempter approached him and said, "If you're the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
40:4:4:Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
40:4:5:Next, the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
40:4:6:"If you're the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
40:4:7:Jesus answered, "Again, it is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
40:4:8:Finally, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
40:4:9:"All this I will give you," he said, "if you bow down and worship me."
40:4:10:Then Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
40:4:11:With that, the devil left him, and angels came and attended to Jesus.
40:4:12:When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.
40:4:13:Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali.
40:4:14:This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
40:4:15:"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
40:4:16:the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned."
40:4:17:From that time on, Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
40:4:18:As he walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
40:4:19:"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
40:4:20:Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
40:4:21:Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,
40:4:22:and at once they left the boat and their father, and followed him.
40:4:23:Jesus traveled throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40:4:24:News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.
40:4:25:Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan followed him.
40:5:1:Blessed are the spiritually needy, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
40:5:2:Joyful are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40:5:3:Fortunate are the humble, for they will inherit the earth.
40:5:4:Happy are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
40:5:5:Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
40:5:6:Content are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
40:5:7:Favored are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
40:5:8:Graced are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
40:5:9:Rejoice when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
40:5:10:Be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.
40:5:11:You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It's good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
40:5:12:You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
40:5:13:No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, so it gives light to everyone in the house.
40:5:14:Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
40:5:15:Don't think I've come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
40:5:16:Truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter or stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
40:5:17:Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40:5:18:I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and teachers of the law, you won't enter the kingdom of heaven.
40:5:19:You've heard it said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder,' and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
40:5:20:But I tell you, anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. If you insult someone, you'll be answerable to the court, and if you call someone a fool, you'll be in danger of hellfire.
40:5:21:So, if you're offering your gift at the altar and remember your brother or sister has something against you,
40:5:22:Leave your gift there, go and be reconciled to them; then come back and offer your gift.
40:5:23:Settle matters quickly with your adversary who's taking you to court. Do it while you're still together on the way, or they may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to the officer, and you'll be thrown into prison.
40:5:24:Truly I tell you, you won't get out until you've paid the last penny.
40:5:25:You've heard it said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
40:5:26:But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40:5:27:If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40:5:28:And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
40:5:29:It's been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'
40:5:30:But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
40:5:31:Again, you've heard it said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.'
40:5:32:But I tell you, don
40:5:33:Instead, let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
40:5:34:You've heard it said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'
40:5:35:But I tell you, don't resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
40:5:36:If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
40:5:37:If someone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
40:5:38:Give to the one who asks you, and don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
40:5:39:You've heard it said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
40:5:40:But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
40:5:41:So that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40:5:42:If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do that.
40:5:43:And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Even pagans do that.
40:5:44:Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
40:6:1:Be mindful of your acts of charity, not displaying them for others to see. If you do, you'll have no reward from your Father in heaven.
40:6:2:When giving to the needy, don't announce it with fanfare, like the hypocrites do in synagogues and on streets, seeking praise from others. They've already received their reward.
40:6:3:Instead, when you give to the needy, keep it secret, so your left hand doesn't know what your right hand is doing.
40:6:4:By giving in secret, your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:5:When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray in synagogues and at street corners, so people can see them. They've already received their reward.
40:6:6:But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:7:When praying, don't babble on like the pagans, thinking they'll be heard because of their many words.
40:6:8:Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
40:6:9:Pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored.
40:6:10:May your kingdom come, and your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
40:6:11:Give us today our daily bread,
40:6:12:And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40:6:13:Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.'
40:6:14:If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40:6:15:But if you don't forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
40:6:16:When you fast, don't look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they're fasting. They've already received their reward.
40:6:17:Instead, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
40:6:18:So it's not obvious to others that you're fasting, but only to your Father who is unseen. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40:6:19:Don't store up treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break in and steal.
40:6:20:Instead, store up treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.
40:6:21:For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
40:6:22:The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
40:6:23:But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
40:6:24:No one can serve two masters. Either you'll hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
40:6:25:That's why I tell you not to worry about your life—what you'll eat or drink—or about your body, what you'll wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
40:6:26:Look at the birds of the air; they don't sow or reap or store away in barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you more valuable than they?
40:6:27:Can any one of you, by worrying, add a single hour to your life?
40:6:28:And why worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow. They don't labor or spin.
40:6:29:Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
40:6:30:If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
40:6:31:So don't worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
40:6:32:For the pagans chase after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
40:6:33:Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you as well.
40:6:34:Therefore, don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
40:7:1:Don't judge others, so you won't be judged.
40:7:2:You'll be judged in the same way you judge others, and the measure you use will be used for you.
40:7:3:Why do you notice the speck in your friend's eye but ignore the log in your own?
40:7:4:How can you say to your friend, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there's a log in your own eye?
40:7:5:You hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye; then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
40:7:6:Don't give holy things to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs. They might trample them underfoot and then turn to attack you.
40:7:7:Ask, and you'll receive; seek, and you'll find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.
40:7:8:Everyone who asks receives; whoever seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
40:7:9:Which of you would give your child a stone if they asked for bread?
40:7:10:Or if they ask for a fish, would you give them a snake?
40:7:11:If you, being imperfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
40:7:12:So, treat others the way you want them to treat you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
40:7:13:Enter through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many go that way.
40:7:14:But narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
40:7:15:Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
40:7:16:You'll recognize them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
40:7:17:A good tree produces good fruit, while a bad tree bears bad fruit.
40:7:18:A good tree can't bear bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.
40:7:19:Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40:7:20:So, you'll recognize them by their fruits.
40:7:21:Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
40:7:22:On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?'
40:7:23:Then I'll tell them plainly, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.'
40:7:24:Anyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise person who built their house on rock.
40:7:25:The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it didn't fall because its foundation was on the rock.
40:7:26:But anyone who hears these words of mine and doesn't put them into practice is like a foolish person who built their house on sand.
40:7:27:The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and its collapse was great."
40:7:28:When Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
40:7:29:for he taught with authority, unlike their religious leaders.
40:8:1:When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
40:8:2:A man with leprosy approached and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean."
40:8:3:Jesus reached out his hand, touched the man, and said, "I am willing; be clean." Immediately, the man's leprosy was healed.
40:8:4:Then Jesus told him, "Don't tell anyone about this, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them."
40:8:5:As Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading for help.
40:8:6:"Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."
40:8:7:Jesus replied, "I will come and heal him."
40:8:8:The centurion responded, "Lord, I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
40:8:9:For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
40:8:10:When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly, I tell you, I haven't found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
40:8:11:I say to you that many will come from east and west and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
40:8:12:But the children of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40:8:13:Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that moment.
40:8:14:Jesus went to Peter's house, where he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
40:8:15:He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
40:8:16:That evening they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
40:8:17:This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases."
40:8:18:When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
40:8:19:A teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
40:8:20:Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
40:8:21:Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
40:8:22:But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
40:8:23:He got into the boat, and his disciples followed him.
40:8:24:Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
40:8:25:The disciples woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"
40:8:26:He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
40:8:27:The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"
40:8:28:When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
40:8:29:"What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"
40:8:30:Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
40:8:31:The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
40:8:32:He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water
40:8:33:Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town, and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
40:8:34:The whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
40:9:1:Jesus got into a boat, crossed over the water, and arrived at his hometown.
40:9:2:Some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take courage, my friend; your sins are forgiven."
40:9:3:Certain religious leaders thought to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
40:9:4:Knowing their thoughts, Jesus asked, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
40:9:5:Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or 'Get up and walk'?
40:9:6:But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
40:9:7:The man stood up and went home.
40:9:8:When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God for giving such authority to human beings.
40:9:9:As Jesus continued on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Matthew got up and followed him.
40:9:10:Later, Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, and many tax collectors and sinners came to eat with him and his disciples.
40:9:11:When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
40:9:12:Hearing this, Jesus replied, "Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick ones do.
40:9:13:Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' I have come not to call the righteous, but sinners."
40:9:14:Then John's disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
40:9:15:Jesus answered, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast.
40:9:16:No one patches an old garment with a new piece of unshrunk cloth. The patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
40:9:17:Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, so both are preserved."
40:9:18:While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But if you come and place your hand on her, she will live."
40:9:19:Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
40:9:20:A woman who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years approached him from behind and touched the edge of his cloak.
40:9:21:She thought to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
40:9:22:Jesus turned around, saw her, and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
40:9:23:When Jesus arrived at the ruler's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes,
40:9:24:he said, "Go away. The girl isn't dead but asleep." They laughed at him.
40:9:25:After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
40:9:26:News of this spread throughout the region.
40:9:27:As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40:9:28:When he entered a house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus asked them, "Do you believe I can do this?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
40:9:29:Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
40:9:30:And their sight was restored. Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
40:9:31:But they went out and spread the news about him throughout the area.
40:9:32:As they were leaving, a man who was demon-possessed and could not speak was brought to Jesus.
40:9:33:When the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
40:9:34:But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the prince of demons."
40:9:35:Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.
40:9:36:When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
40:9:37:Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
40:9:38:Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."
40:10:1:Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, enabling them to drive them out and heal every sickness and disease.
40:10:2:These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (also known as Peter) and his brother Andrew; James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
40:10:3:Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40:10:4:Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.
40:10:5:Jesus sent these twelve out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
40:10:6:Instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel.
40:10:7:As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
40:10:8:Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, and drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
40:10:9:Do not take along gold, silver, or copper in your belts;
40:10:10:nor a bag for your journey, extra clothes, sandals, or a staff, for the worker is worth their keep.
40:10:11:When you enter a town or village, find a worthy person and stay at their home until you leave.
40:10:12:As you enter the house, greet its occupants.
40:10:13:If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
40:10:14:If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.
40:10:15:Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
40:10:16:See, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
40:10:17:Be on your guard; people will hand you over to local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
40:10:18:You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles.
40:10:19:But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,
40:10:20:for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
40:10:21:Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
40:10:22:You will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40:10:23:When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
40:10:24:A student is not above their teacher, nor a servant above their master.
40:10:25:It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!
40:10:26:So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
40:10:27:What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
40:10:28:Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
40:10:29:Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
40:10:30:And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
40:10:31:So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
40:10:32:Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
40:10:33:But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.
40:10:34:Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40:10:35:I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
40:10:36:A person's enemies will be the members of their own household.
40:10:37:Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
40:10:38:Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
40:10:39:Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
40:10:40:Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
40:10:41:Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.
40:10:42:And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.
40:11:1:At that time, Jesus began to speak about John the Baptist to the crowds.
40:11:2:"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
40:11:3:If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are found in royal palaces.
40:11:4:So, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
40:11:5:This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
40:11:6:Blessed is the one who does not stumble on account of me."
40:11:7:As they went away, Jesus continued to address the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
40:11:8:Indeed, I tell you that among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40:11:9:From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people have been seizing it.
40:11:10:For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40:11:11:And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
40:11:12:Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40:11:13:"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:
40:11:14:'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
40:11:15:For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
40:11:16:The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds."
40:11:17:Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent:
40:11:18:"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40:11:19:But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
40:11:20:And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
40:11:21:But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
40:11:22:At that time, Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children.
40:11:23:Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
40:11:24:All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
40:11:25:Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
40:11:26:Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
40:11:27:For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
40:12:1:At that time, Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
40:12:2:When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
40:12:3:Jesus replied, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
40:12:4:He entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests.
40:12:5:Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
40:12:6:I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
40:12:7:If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
40:12:8:For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40:12:9:Moving on from there, Jesus went into their synagogue,
40:12:10:and there was a man with a shriveled hand. They asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.
40:12:11:He answered, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
40:12:12:How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
40:12:13:Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.
40:12:14:But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
40:12:15:Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill.
40:12:16:He warned them not to make him known,
40:12:17:to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
40:12:18:"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
40:12:19:He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
40:12:20:A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.
40:12:21:In his name, the nations will put their hope."
40:12:22:Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him so that he could both talk and see.
40:12:23:All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
40:12:24:But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."
40:12:25:Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
40:12:26:If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
40:12:27:And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
40:12:28:But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
40:12:29:"Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
40:12:30:"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
40:12:31:And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40:12:32:Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
40:12:33:"Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
40:12:34:You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
40:12:35:A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
40:12:36:But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
40:12:37:For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."
40:12:38:Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
40:12:39:He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40:12:40:For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
40:12:41:The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.
40:12:42:The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
40:12:43:"When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
40:12:44:Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.
40:12:45:Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."
40:12:46:While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
40:12:47:Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
40:12:48:He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
40:12:49:Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.
40:12:50:For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
40:13:1:That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.
40:13:2:A large crowd gathered around him, so he climbed into a boat and sat down, while the people stood on the shore.
40:13:3:He told them many things in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds.
40:13:4:As he scattered the seeds, some fell on the path, where birds came and ate them up.
40:13:5:Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil. They sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.
40:13:6:But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and since they had no deep roots, they withered away.
40:13:7:Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the young plants.
40:13:8:Still other seeds fell on good soil, where they produced a crop—a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
40:13:9:If you have ears, listen!"
40:13:10:The disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
40:13:11:He replied, "You are given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but for them it is not granted.
40:13:12:Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they possess will be taken from them.
40:13:13:This is why I use parables: because seeing, they do not see; and hearing, they do not hear or understand.
40:13:14:In them, the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: 'You will hear but never understand, and you will see but never perceive.
40:13:15:For this people's heart has grown calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.'
40:13:16:But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40:13:17:Truly, I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40:13:18:Listen, then, to the parable of the sower:
40:13:19:When anyone hears the message about the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
40:13:20:The seed that fell on rocky ground represents those who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy.
40:13:21:But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
40:13:22:The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear the word, but the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
40:13:23:But the seed sown on good soil refers to those who hear the word, understand it, and produce a crop—yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown."
40:13:24:Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40:13:25:But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
40:13:26:When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, the weeds also appeared.
40:13:27:The owner's servants approached him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'
40:13:28:He replied, 'An enemy did this.' The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
40:13:29:'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.
40:13:30:Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"
40:13:31:Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
40:13:32:Though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants and turns into a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."
40:13:33:He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."
40:13:34:Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
40:13:35:So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."
40:13:36:Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
40:13:37:He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
40:13:38:The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,
40:13:39:and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
40:13:40:As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
40:13:41:The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
40:13:42:They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:13:43:Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.
40:13:44:The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
40:13:45:Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
40:13:46:When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
40:13:47:Once more, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
40:13:48:When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.
40:13:49:This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40:13:50:and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:13:51:"Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied.
40:13:52:He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
40:13:53:When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
40:13:54:Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked.
40:13:55:Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
40:13:56:Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"
40:13:57:And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home."
40:13:58:And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
40:14:1:At that time, Herod the ruler heard about Jesus,
40:14:2:and he told his servants, "This must be John the Baptist; he's been raised from the dead! That's why he can perform these miracles."
40:14:3:Now, Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
40:14:4:John had said to Herod, "It's not right for you to have her."
40:14:5:Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, who considered John a prophet.
40:14:6:On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for everyone, and it pleased Herod so much
40:14:7:that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.
40:14:8:Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me John the Baptist's head on a platter."
40:14:9:The king was upset, but because of his oath and his dinner guests, he ordered it to be done.
40:14:10:So he sent someone to behead John in prison.
40:14:11:John's head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.
40:14:12:Later, John's disciples came, collected his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
40:14:13:When Jesus heard what had happened, he left in a boat to a remote place by himself. But the crowds found out and followed him on foot from the towns.
40:14:14:As he stepped ashore, he saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them, healing their sick.
40:14:15:As evening approached, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "This is a remote place, and it's getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
40:14:16:But Jesus replied, "They don't need to leave; you give them something to eat."
40:14:17:They answered, "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish."
40:14:18:"Bring them here to me," Jesus said.
40:14:19:He told the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed the food, and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the crowd.
40:14:20:Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples collected twelve baskets full of leftover pieces.
40:14:21:The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, not counting women and children.
40:14:22:Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he sent the crowds away.
40:14:23:After dismissing the crowds, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,
40:14:24:while the boat was already far from land, being battered by the waves because the wind was against it.
40:14:25:In the early morning hours, Jesus went out to them, walking on the water.
40:14:26:When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and cried out, "It's a ghost!" They were so afraid.
40:14:27:But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, "Take courage! It's me. Don't be afraid."
40:14:28:Peter replied, "Lord, if it's you, command me to come to you on the water."
40:14:29:Jesus said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.
40:14:30:But when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he became frightened and started to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
40:14:31:Immediately, Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
40:14:32:As they climbed into the boat, the wind stopped.
40:14:33:Those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God."
40:14:34:After crossing over, they landed at Gennesaret.
40:14:35:The people there recognized Jesus and spread the news throughout the region. They brought all their sick to him,
40:14:36:and begged him just to let them touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
40:15:1:One day, the Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
40:15:2:"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat."
40:15:3:Jesus replied, "And why do you break God's commandment for the sake of your tradition?
40:15:4:For God said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.'
40:15:5:But you say that if someone tells their parents, 'Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'
40:15:6:they are not required to honor their father or mother. In this way, you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
40:15:7:You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
40:15:8:'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40:15:9:They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'"
40:15:10:Then Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
40:15:11:What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them."
40:15:12:Later, his disciples approached him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
40:15:13:He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
40:15:14:Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."
40:15:15:Peter then asked Jesus, "Explain the parable to us."
40:15:16:Jesus said, "Are you still so dull? Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
40:15:17:But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.
40:15:18:For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
40:15:19:These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them."
40:15:20:Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40:15:21:A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly."
40:15:22:Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
40:15:23:He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."
40:15:24:The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said.
40:15:25:He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."
40:15:26:"Yes it is, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
40:15:27:Then Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment.
40:15:28:Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
40:15:29:Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.
40:15:30:The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
40:15:31:Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
40:15:32:His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"
40:15:33:"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."
40:15:34:He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
40:15:35:Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.
40:15:36:They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40:15:37:The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
40:15:38:After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
40:16:1:One day, the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus, testing him by asking for a sign from heaven.
40:16:2:He replied, "In the evening, you say it will be fair weather because the sky is red,
40:16:3:and in the morning, you predict stormy weather because the sky is red and gloomy. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you can't understand the signs of the times.
40:16:4:A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away.
40:16:5:As they crossed the lake, the disciples realized they had forgotten to bring bread.
40:16:6:Jesus said to them, "Be careful, and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40:16:7:They discussed this among themselves, thinking, "We didn't bring any bread."
40:16:8:Understanding their thoughts, Jesus said, "You have so little faith! Why are you worried about not having bread?
40:16:9:Don't you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand, and how many baskets you collected afterward?
40:16:10:Or the seven loaves that fed the four thousand, and how many large baskets you gathered then?
40:16:11:How can you not understand that I was not talking about bread? Be on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40:16:12:Then they understood that he wasn't warning them about the yeast used in bread, but about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40:16:13:When Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
40:16:14:They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
40:16:15:He then asked them, "But who do you say I am?"
40:16:16:Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
40:16:17:Jesus responded, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
40:16:18:And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
40:16:19:I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
40:16:20:Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
40:16:21:From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
40:16:22:Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
40:16:23:Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."
40:16:24:Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
40:16:25:For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
40:16:26:What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
40:16:27:For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
40:16:28:Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
40:17:1:One day, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a high mountain by themselves.
40:17:2:He was transformed before them; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
40:17:3:Then Moses and Elijah appeared, talking with Jesus.
40:17:4:Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it's great for us to be here. If you want, I'll put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40:17:5:While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
40:17:6:Hearing this, the disciples fell facedown, filled with awe.
40:17:7:But Jesus came over, touched them, and said, "Get up, don't be afraid."
40:17:8:When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
40:17:9:As they descended the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
40:17:10:The disciples asked Jesus, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
40:17:11:He replied, "Elijah does come first and restores all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they didn't recognize him. Instead, they did whatever they wanted to him. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands."
40:17:12:Then the disciples understood that he was talking about John the Baptist.
40:17:13:When they returned to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
40:17:14:He said, "Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and suffers terribly. He often falls into the fire or water.
40:17:15:I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."
40:17:16:Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and perverse generation! How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."
40:17:17:Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, who was healed from that moment.
40:17:18:The disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
40:17:19:He answered, "Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
40:17:20:When they gathered in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
40:17:21:They will kill him, but on the third day he will rise." And the disciples were filled with grief.
40:17:22:As they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
40:17:23:"Yes, he does," Peter replied. When he went inside, Jesus spoke first, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—from their own children or from others?"
40:17:24:Peter answered, "From others." Jesus said, "Then the children are exempt.
40:17:25:But so we don't offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you'll find a coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."
40:18:1:At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40:18:2:Jesus called a little child over and had them stand among them.
40:18:3:He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40:18:4:Whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40:18:5:And anyone who welcomes one such child in my name also welcomes me.
40:18:6:But if someone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
40:18:7:Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks! Stumbling blocks are inevitable, but woe to the person through whom they come!
40:18:8:If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
40:18:9:And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
40:18:10:See that you don't look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
40:18:11:The Son of Man came to save what was lost.
40:18:12:What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go search for the one that wandered off?
40:18:13:And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that didn't wander off.
40:18:14:In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
40:18:15:If your brother or sister sins against you, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
40:18:16:But if they don't listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
40:18:17:If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
40:18:18:Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
40:18:19:Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
40:18:20:For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."
40:18:21:Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
40:18:22:Jesus answered, "I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.
40:18:23:Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
40:18:24:As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.
40:18:25:Since he couldn't pay, the master ordered that he, his wife, his children, and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
40:18:26:The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I'll pay back everything.'
40:18:27:The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt, and let him go.
40:18:28:But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded.
40:18:29:His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I'll pay you back.'
40:18:30:But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
40:18:31:When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had occurred.
40:18:32:Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
40:18:33:Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'
40:18:34:In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed.
40:18:35:This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
40:19:1:After Jesus had finished speaking, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
40:19:2:Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
40:19:3:Some Pharisees approached him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
40:19:4:He answered, "Haven't you read that the Creator made them male and female from the beginning,
40:19:5:and said, 'For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?
40:19:6:So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
40:19:7:They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
40:19:8:Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but it was not like this from the beginning.
40:19:9:I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."
40:19:10:The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it's better not to marry."
40:19:11:But Jesus responded, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, only those to whom it has been given.
40:19:12:For there are eunuchs who were born that way, others who have been made eunuchs by others, and still others who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."
40:19:13:Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
40:19:14:Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
40:19:15:After he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
40:19:16:A man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life?"
40:19:17:He answered, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There's only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
40:19:18:"Which ones?" the man inquired. Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,
40:19:19:honor your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"
40:19:20:The young man said, "All these I have kept. What do I still lack?"
40:19:21:Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
40:19:22:When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
40:19:23:Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it's hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
40:19:24:Again I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
40:19:25:When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"
40:19:26:Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40:19:27:Peter replied, "We've left everything to follow you! What will there be for us?"
40:19:28:Jesus said to them, "I assure you that when the world is made new and the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
40:19:29:And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
40:19:30:But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first."
40:20:1:In the kingdom of heaven, it's like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40:20:2:After agreeing with the workers on one denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard.
40:20:3:Around nine in the morning, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
40:20:4:To these, he said, 'You too go work in my vineyard, and I'll pay you a fair wage.'
40:20:5:So they went. He did the same thing again at noon and around three in the afternoon.
40:20:6:About five in the afternoon, he found more people standing around and asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?'
40:20:7:They replied, 'Because no one has hired us.' He told them, 'Go work in my vineyard as well.'
40:20:8:When evening came, the owner of the vineyard instructed his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and moving on to the first.'
40:20:9:The workers who were hired at about five in the afternoon each received one denarius.
40:20:10:When those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more, but they also got one denarius each.
40:20:11:Upon receiving it, they grumbled against the landowner,
40:20:12:saying, 'These last workers only put in an hour, yet you've made them equal to us who bore the day's burden and heat.'
40:20:13:But the landowner replied to one of them, 'Friend, I'm not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for one denarius?
40:20:14:Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as you.
40:20:15:Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I'm generous?'
40:20:16:So, the last will be first, and the first will be last.
40:20:17:As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately and told them,
40:20:18:'We're going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
40:20:19:and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. On the third day, he will be raised to life.'
40:20:20:The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons, kneeling down and asking a favor from him.
40:20:21:He asked her, 'What do you want?' She replied, 'Declare that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.'
40:20:22:Jesus answered, 'You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink the cup I'm going to drink?' They responded, 'We can.'
40:20:23:He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom my Father has prepared them.'
40:20:24:When the ten other disciples heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
40:20:25:But Jesus called them together and said, 'You know that rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
40:20:26:It shouldn't be like that among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
40:20:27:and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—
40:20:28:just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'
40:20:29:As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.
40:20:30:Two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by, so they shouted, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
40:20:31:The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet. But they shouted even louder, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
40:20:32:Jesus stopped and called them, asking, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
40:20:33:They replied, 'Lord, we want our sight
40:20:34:Jesus, filled with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
40:21:1:As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
40:21:2:telling them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and you will immediately find a donkey tied up along with her colt. Untie them and bring them to me.
40:21:3:If anyone says anything to you, just tell them that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away."
40:21:4:This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
40:21:5:"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
40:21:6:The disciples went and did as Jesus instructed them.
40:21:7:They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on top.
40:21:8:A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
40:21:9:The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
40:21:10:When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
40:21:11:The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
40:21:12:Jesus went into the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
40:21:13:And he said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers."
40:21:14:The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
40:21:15:But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.
40:21:16:"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?"
40:21:17:Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
40:21:18:Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.
40:21:19:Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.
40:21:20:When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
40:21:21:Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
40:21:22:If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."
40:21:23:When he entered the temple courts again, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
40:21:24:Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40:21:25:John's baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
40:21:26:But if we say, 'Of human origin'—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet."
40:21:27:So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40:21:28:"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'
40:21:29:'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.
40:21:30:Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.
40:21:31:Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
40:21:32:For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
40:21:33:Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented it to some farmers and moved to another place.
40:21:34:When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
40:21:35:The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
40:21:36:Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.
40:21:37:Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.
40:21:38:But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'
40:21:39:So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
40:21:40:Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
40:21:41:"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
40:21:42:Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
40:21:43:Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
40:21:44:Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed."
40:21:45:When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them.
40:21:46:They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
40:22:1:At that time, Jesus started speaking to them in stories. He said, "The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who arranged a wedding feast for his son.
40:22:2:He sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they didn't want to come.
40:22:3:Again, he sent out other servants, instructing them to tell the invitees, 'Look, I've prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'
40:22:4:But they ignored the invitation and went their separate ways—one to his farm, another to his business.
40:22:5:Others seized the king's servants, mistreated them, and eventually killed them.
40:22:6:The king was furious, so he sent his army to destroy those murderers and burn their city.
40:22:7:Then he told his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited didn't deserve to come.
40:22:8:Go to the street corners and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.'
40:22:9:So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
40:22:10:When the king entered to see the guests, he noticed a man there who wasn't wearing wedding clothes.
40:22:11:He asked him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' But the man had nothing to say.
40:22:12:Then the king told his servants, 'Tie him up, hand and foot, and throw him outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40:22:13:For many are called, but few are chosen."
40:22:14:Then the Pharisees went and made a plan to trap Jesus in his words.
40:22:15:They sent their disciples, along with the Herodians, to him. They said, "Teacher, we know you are honest and teach the way of God truthfully, without favoring anyone. 
40:22:16:So tell us what you think: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
40:22:17:But Jesus knew their evil intentions and said, "Why are you trying to test me, you hypocrites?
40:22:18:Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius,
40:22:19:and he asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
40:22:20:They replied, "Caesar's." Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
40:22:21:When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
40:22:22:That same day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
40:22:23:"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.
40:22:24:Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
40:22:25:The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, right on down to the seventh.
40:22:26:Finally, the woman died too.
40:22:27:Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"
40:22:28:Jesus answered, "You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God.
40:22:29:At the resurrection, people won't marry or be given in marriage; they'll be like the angels in heaven.
40:22:30:As for the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read what God said to you:
40:22:31:'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
40:22:32:When the crowds heard this, they were astonished by his teaching.
40:22:33:Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
40:22:34:One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:
40:22:35:"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
40:22:36:Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
40:22:37:This is the first and greatest commandment.
40:22:38:The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
40:22:39:All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments."
40:22:40:While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
40:22:41:"What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They answered, "The son of David."
40:22:42:He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says,
40:22:43:'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'
40:22:44:If David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
40:22:45:No one could answer him a word, and from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
40:23:1:Jesus then spoke to the crowds and his disciples,
40:23:2:saying, "The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses.
40:23:3:So you should pay attention to what they say and follow their instructions. But don't imitate their actions, for they don't practice what they preach.
40:23:4:They place heavy burdens on others' shoulders but refuse to lift a finger to help carry them.
40:23:5:Everything they do is for show. They wear broad phylacteries and long tassels on their garments,
40:23:6:and they love the best seats at feasts and the most prominent positions in the synagogues.
40:23:7:They enjoy being greeted with respect in public places and being called 'Rabbi.'
40:23:8:But as for you, don't let anyone call you 'Rabbi,' because you have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers and sisters.
40:23:9:And don't call anyone on earth 'Father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
40:23:10:Nor should you be called 'Teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
40:23:11:The greatest among you will be your servant.
40:23:12:Whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted.
40:23:13:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
40:23:14:[Verse 14 is not found in some early manuscripts]
40:23:15:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
40:23:16:Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.'
40:23:17:You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
40:23:18:You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.'
40:23:19:You blind people! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
40:23:20:Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
40:23:21:And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
40:23:22:And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.
40:23:23:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
40:23:24:You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
40:23:25:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40:23:26:Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
40:23:27:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
40:23:28:In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
40:23:29:Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
40:23:30:And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
40:23:31:So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40:23:32:Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!
40:23:33:You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
40:23:34:Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
40:23:35:And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40:23:36:Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.
40:23:37:Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
40:23:38:Look, your house is left to you desolate.
40:23:39:For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
40:24:1:As Jesus left the temple and walked away, his disciples approached him to point out its buildings.
40:24:2:He responded, "Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
40:24:3:Later, as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
40:24:4:Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
40:24:5:Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and they will deceive many people.
40:24:6:You'll hear about wars and rumors of wars. Don't be alarmed; these things must happen, but the end is still to come.
40:24:7:Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40:24:8:All these events are just the beginning of birth pains.
40:24:9:Then they'll hand you over to be persecuted and killed, and you'll be hated by all nations because of me.
40:24:10:At that time, many will turn away from their faith, betray each other, and hate one another.
40:24:11:False prophets will appear and deceive many people.
40:24:12:Because wickedness will increase, most people's love will grow cold.
40:24:13:But whoever stands firm until the end will be saved.
40:24:14:This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
40:24:15:When you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
40:24:16:then those who are in Judea should flee to the mountains.
40:24:17:If someone is on the rooftop, they must not go down to take anything out of their house.
40:24:18:If they're in the field, they shouldn't return to get their cloak.
40:24:19:How terrible it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
40:24:20:Pray that your escape won't be during winter or on the Sabbath.
40:24:21:For then there will be great distress, unmatched from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.
40:24:22:If those days hadn't been cut short, nobody would survive. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
40:24:23:At that time, if anyone tells you, 'Look, here's the Messiah!' or 'There he is!' don't believe it.
40:24:24:False messiahs and false prophets will arise, performing great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
40:24:25:Take note, I have warned you in advance.
40:24:26:So if they say to you, 'He's in the wilderness,' don't go out; or 'He's in the inner rooms,' don't believe it.
40:24:27:As lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:28:Wherever there's a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
40:24:29:Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon won't give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
40:24:30:Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
40:24:31:He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
40:24:32:Learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
40:24:33:In the same way, when you see all these things, know that he is near, right at the door.
40:24:34:Truly, I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
40:24:35:Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
40:24:36:No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
40:24:37:As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:38:In those days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark.
40:24:39:They didn't realize what was happening until the flood came and swept them all away. That's how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40:24:40:Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
40:24:41:Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
40:24:42:So stay alert, because you don't know on what day your Lord will come.
40:24:43:But understand this: If the homeowner had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not let his house be broken into.
40:24:44:So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
40:24:45:Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
40:24:46:Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
40:24:47:Truly, I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40:24:48:But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time,'
40:24:49:and he begins to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with drunkards,
40:24:50:the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour he's not aware of.
40:24:51:He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40:25:1:At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
40:25:2:Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
40:25:3:The foolish ones brought their lamps but didn't bring any extra oil,
40:25:4:while the wise ones took oil in containers along with their lamps.
40:25:5:As the groom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40:25:6:In the middle of the night, there was a shout: 'Look! The groom is here! Come out to meet him.'
40:25:7:Then all the bridesmaids woke up and prepared their lamps.
40:25:8:The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'
40:25:9:But the wise ones replied, 'No, there may not be enough for both us and you. Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'
40:25:10:While they were gone to buy oil, the groom arrived, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
40:25:11:Later, the other bridesmaids came too, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'
40:25:12:But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'
40:25:13:So stay alert, because you don't know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.
40:25:14:It's like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.
40:25:15:To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to their ability. Then he went on his journey.
40:25:16:The servant who received the five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work, earning five more bags.
40:25:17:In the same way, the one with two bags gained two more.
40:25:18:But the servant who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
40:25:19:After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
40:25:20:The one who had received five bags of gold came forward, bringing five more bags and said, 'Master, you entrusted me with five bags of gold. Look, I have gained five more.'
40:25:21:His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You've been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40:25:22:The one with two bags of gold also came and said, 'Master, you gave me two bags of gold. Look, I have gained two more.'
40:25:23:His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You've been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40:25:24:Then the servant who had received the one bag of gold came and said, 'Master, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you haven't sown and gathering where you haven't scattered seed.
40:25:25:So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. Here is what belongs to you.'
40:25:26:His master replied, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I harvest where I haven't sown and gather where I haven't scattered seed?
40:25:27:You should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned, I would have received it back with interest.
40:25:28:So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
40:25:29:For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
40:25:30:And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40:25:31:When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
40:25:32:All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40:25:33:He will place the sheep on the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
40:25:34:Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
40:25:35:For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,
40:25:36:I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'
40:25:37:Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
40:25:38:When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?
40:25:39:When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'
40:25:40:The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'
40:25:41:Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
40:25:42:For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
40:25:43:I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
40:25:44:They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'
40:25:45:He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
40:25:46:Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
40:26:1:Around the time of the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the chief priests and elders gathered to plot how they could arrest Jesus and put him to death.
40:26:2:They decided not to do this during the festival, fearing that it might cause an uproar among the people.
40:26:3:Meanwhile, in Bethany at Simon the leper's house, a woman approached Jesus with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he reclined at the table.
40:26:4:Seeing this, the disciples became indignant and asked, "Why this waste?
40:26:5:This perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor."
40:26:6:Jesus, aware of their thoughts, said, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
40:26:7:The poor will always be with you, but you won't always have me.
40:26:8:By pouring this perfume on my body, she prepared me for burial.
40:26:9:Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
40:26:10:Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests
40:26:11:and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They counted out thirty silver coins for him.
40:26:12:From that moment on, Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
40:26:13:On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples asked Jesus, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
40:26:14:He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
40:26:15:The disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared the Passover meal.
40:26:16:That evening, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
40:26:17:As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
40:26:18:Deeply saddened, each disciple began to ask, "Surely not I, Lord?"
40:26:19:Jesus answered, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
40:26:20:The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him, but woe to the one who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had never been born."
40:26:21:Then Judas, the one who would betray him, asked, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied, "You have said it yourself."
40:26:22:While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
40:26:23:Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
40:26:24:This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
40:26:25:I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine again until the day I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."
40:26:26:After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40:26:27:Then Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
40:26:28:But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
40:26:29:Peter replied, "Even if all fall away because of you, I never will."
40:26:30:"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
40:26:31:But Peter declared, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And all the other disciples said the same.
40:26:32:Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
40:26:33:He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
40:26:34:Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
40:26:35:Going a little farther, he fell facedown and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
40:26:36:He returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
40:26:37:"Watch and pray so that you won't fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
40:26:38:He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."
40:26:39:When he came back, he again found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
40:26:40:So he left them and went away once more, praying the same thing a third time.
40:26:41:Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
40:26:42:Get up! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
40:26:43:While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
40:26:44:Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."
40:26:45:Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
40:26:46:Jesus replied, "Do what you came for, friend." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
40:26:47:With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
40:26:48:"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
40:26:49:Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
40:26:50:But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?"
40:26:51:At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
40:26:52:But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
40:26:53:Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
40:26:54:But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
40:26:55:The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so they could put him to death.
40:26:56:But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward
40:26:57:and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
40:26:58:Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
40:26:59:But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
40:26:60:"You have said so," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
40:26:61:Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
40:26:62:What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.
40:26:63:Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
40:26:64:and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?"
40:26:65:Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
40:26:66:But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you're talking about."
40:26:67:As he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
40:26:68:Again he denied it, swearing, "I don't know the man!"
40:26:69:A little while later, those standing nearby approached Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
40:26:70:Then he began to call down curses and swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
40:26:71:Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
40:27:1:At daybreak, the chief priests and elders of the people made plans to put Jesus to death.
40:27:2:After tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
40:27:3:When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that he was condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders.
40:27:4:"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood," he said. But they replied, "What is that to us? You bear the responsibility."
40:27:5:So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
40:27:6:The chief priests took the silver coins but decided not to put them into the temple treasury since it was blood money.
40:27:7:They used the money to buy a potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
40:27:8:That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood today.
40:27:9:This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
40:27:10:and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
40:27:11:Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
40:27:12:But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not respond.
40:27:13:Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"
40:27:14:Yet Jesus remained silent, not answering even one charge, which greatly amazed the governor.
40:27:15:Now during the feast, the governor had a custom to release one prisoner chosen by the crowd.
40:27:16:At that time, there was a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
40:27:17:So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"
40:27:18:For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
40:27:19:While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of him."
40:27:20:But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and have Jesus executed.
40:27:21:"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
40:27:22:Pilate then asked them, "What should I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?" They all replied, "Crucify him!"
40:27:23:"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
40:27:24:Seeing that he was getting nowhere and that a riot was starting, Pilate took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility."
40:27:25:All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
40:27:26:Then Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.
40:27:27:The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around him.
40:27:28:They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
40:27:29:and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand, knelt in front of him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
40:27:30:They spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
40:27:31:After they had mocked him, they took off the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.
40:27:32:As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
40:27:33:They came to a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull."
40:27:34:There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
40:27:35:When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
40:27:36:And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
40:27:37:Above his head, they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
40:27:38:Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
40:27:39:Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
40:27:40:and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40:27:41:In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders mocked him.
40:27:42:"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
40:27:43:He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
40:27:44:The rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
40:27:45:From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the land.
40:27:46:About three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
40:27:47:When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."
40:27:48:Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
40:27:49:The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
40:27:50:And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
40:27:51:At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split,
40:27:52:and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
40:27:53:They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
40:27:54:When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
40:27:55:Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
40:27:56:Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
40:27:57:As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
40:27:58:He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body, which Pilate ordered to be given to him.
40:27:59:Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
40:27:60:and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
40:27:61:Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
40:27:62:The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
40:27:63:"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
40:27:64:So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
40:27:65:Pilate answered, "You have a guard; go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."
40:27:66:So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
40:28:1:After the Sabbath, as Sunday was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
40:28:2:And suddenly there was a great earthquake; an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
40:28:3:His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
40:28:4:The guards trembled with fear and became like dead men.
40:28:5:But the angel said to the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know you're looking for Jesus who was crucified.
40:28:6:He isn't here; he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
40:28:7:Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you."
40:28:8:Filled with joy and fear, they hurried away from the tomb to share the news with his disciples.
40:28:9:As they were running, Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached him, held onto his feet, and worshiped him.
40:28:10:Then Jesus said, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there."
40:28:11:While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
40:28:12:After meeting with the elders and devising a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
40:28:13:saying, "Tell people that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.
40:28:14:If this comes to the governor's attention, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
40:28:15:The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
40:28:16:Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
40:28:17:When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
40:28:18:Jesus approached them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
40:28:19:So go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
40:28:20:teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
