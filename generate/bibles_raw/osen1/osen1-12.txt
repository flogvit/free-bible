12:1:1:After King Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.
12:1:2:Ahaziah, Ahab's son, had an accident in Samaria. He fell through the lattice of his upper room and was injured. So he sent messengers to ask Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he would recover from his injuries.
12:1:3:But the angel of the Lord told Elijah the Tishbite, "Go and meet the messengers of Ahaziah, king of Israel, and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'
12:1:4:Now, this is what the Lord says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on; instead, you will surely die.'" And Elijah left.
12:1:5:The messengers returned to the king, who asked, "Why have you come back so soon?"
12:1:6:They replied, "A man came to meet us and said, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that the Lord asks, "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? You will not leave the bed you are lying on; instead, you will surely die.""
12:1:7:The king asked, "What did the man who spoke to you look like?"
12:1:8:They described him as a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist. The king recognized him and said, "That must be Elijah the Tishbite."
12:1:9:Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to find Elijah. They found him sitting on a hilltop, and the captain said to him, "Man of God, the king orders you to come down."
12:1:10:Elijah replied, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." And fire came down from heaven, consuming the captain and his fifty soldiers.
12:1:11:So the king sent another captain with fifty men. He also said, "Man of God, the king orders you to come down immediately."
12:1:12:Elijah answered, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." And fire came down from heaven again, consuming the captain and his fifty soldiers.
12:1:13:The king sent a third captain with fifty men. This captain approached Elijah respectfully, fell on his knees before him, and pleaded, "Man of God, please spare my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours.
12:1:14:Fire has already come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains and their soldiers. But now, have mercy on my life!"
12:1:15:The angel of the Lord said to Elijah, "Go down with this captain; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah went with him to the king.
12:1:16:Elijah told the king, "This is what the Lord says: 'Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel to consult, you will not leave the bed you are lying on; instead, you will surely die.'"
12:1:17:And Ahaziah died, just as the Lord had spoken through Elijah. Since he had no son, Jehoram, his brother, succeeded him as king, in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
12:1:18:The rest of the events of Ahaziah's reign and all his accomplishments are recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12:2:1:When the time came for the Lord to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, he and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
12:2:2:Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha replied, "As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
12:2:3:The sons of the prophets at Bethel approached Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?" He answered, "Yes, I know; be quiet."
12:2:4:Then Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho." And Elisha responded, "As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.
12:2:5:The sons of the prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?" He replied, "Yes, I know; be quiet."
12:2:6:Again, Elijah said to him, "Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan." Elisha insisted, "As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them continued on.
12:2:7:Fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them and stood at a distance, as they both stood by the Jordan River.
12:2:8:Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
12:2:9:When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away." Elisha replied, "Please let me inherit a double portion of your spirit."
12:2:10:Elijah answered, "You have asked a difficult thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours; otherwise, it won't happen."
12:2:11:As they were walking and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
12:2:12:Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father, my father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And he saw Elijah no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.
12:2:13:He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and returned to the bank of the Jordan.
12:2:14:He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, struck the water with it, and said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" When he struck the water, it divided to the right and left, and Elisha crossed over.
12:2:15:The sons of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
12:2:16:"Look," they said, "we have fifty able men. Let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has lifted him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." Elisha replied, "Do not send them."
12:2:17:But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." They sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
12:2:18:When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he told them, "Didn't I say not to go?"
12:2:19:The people of the city said to Elisha, "The location of this city is good, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."
12:2:20:Elisha said, "Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
12:2:21:He went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the Lord says: 'I have purified this water; from now on neither death nor unproductiveness will come from it.'"
12:2:22:And the water has remained pure to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
12:2:23:From there, Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road
12:2:24:Some young boys came out of the city and began to mock him, saying, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
12:2:25:Elisha turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
12:2:26:And Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
12:3:1:In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for twelve years.
12:3:2:He did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as much as his father and mother. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.
12:3:3:Nevertheless, he continued to follow in the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he did not turn away from them.
12:3:4:Messengers came to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, saying, "The Moabites have rebelled against your father."
12:3:5:Jehoshaphat replied, "Will you join me in battle against Moab?" And the king of Israel said, "I will go with you. My troops, horses, and chariots are at your disposal."
12:3:6:Then he asked, "Which route should we take?" Jehoshaphat answered, "We'll go through the wilderness of Edom."
12:3:7:So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom set out together. After a roundabout march of seven days, there was no water left for the army or the animals with them.
12:3:8:The king of Israel exclaimed, "What! Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"
12:3:9:But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the LORD here? We need to seek the LORD's guidance." One of the servants of the king of Israel replied, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on Elijah's hands."
12:3:10:Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom went down to consult Elisha.
12:3:11:Elisha asked the king of Israel, "What do you want from me? Go consult the prophets of your father and mother." But the king of Israel replied, "No, it's the LORD who has called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."
12:3:12:Elisha answered, "As the LORD of Hosts lives, whom I serve, if I didn't respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I wouldn't even look at you or acknowledge you.
12:3:13:Now, bring me a musician." As the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha,
12:3:14:and he said, "This is what the LORD says: 'Make this valley full of ditches.'
12:3:15:You will not see wind or rain, but this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle, and your animals will drink.
12:3:16:This is an easy thing for the LORD; He will also deliver Moab into your hands.
12:3:17:You will conquer every fortified city and every choice town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."
12:3:18:The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land.
12:3:19:The Moabites heard that the kings had come to fight against them, so every man, young and old, was called up and stationed at the border.
12:3:20:When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. From a distance, the Moabites saw the water and thought it was blood.
12:3:21:"Look!" they exclaimed. "That's blood! The kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now, Moab, let's go and plunder the camp!"
12:3:22:But when they arrived at the Israelite camp, the Israelites attacked them, and the Moabites fled before them. The Israelites pursued them and continued to attack Moab.
12:3:23:The Israelites destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only the city of Kir-hareseth was left with its stone walls, but the slingers surrounded and attacked it as well.
12:3:24:When the king of Moab realized the battle was too fierce for him, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him to try to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
12:3:25:So he took
12:3:26:his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. The fury against Israel was so great that they withdrew and returned to their own land.
12:4:1:A woman from the group of wives of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant, my husband, is dead. You know that he was a devout man of God, but now the creditor is coming to take my two children as slaves."
12:4:2:Elisha asked her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" She replied, "I have nothing at all except a small jar of olive oil."
12:4:3:He instructed her, "Go and borrow empty jars from all your neighbors. Don't just get a few.
12:4:4:Then go inside your house, shut the door behind you and your sons, and start pouring the oil into the jars. As each one is filled, set it aside."
12:4:5:So she left him and did as he said. She shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the jars to her as she poured the oil.
12:4:6:When all the jars were full, she told her son, "Bring me another jar." But he replied, "There are no more jars." Then the oil stopped flowing.
12:4:7:She went and informed Elisha, who said, "Go, sell the oil, and pay off your debt. You and your sons can live on what remains."
12:4:8:One day, Elisha visited the town of Shunem, where he met a wealthy woman who insisted that he stay for a meal. From then on, whenever he passed by, he would stop there for a meal.
12:4:9:The woman said to her husband, "I'm sure this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
12:4:10:Let's make a small room on the roof and put a bed, table, chair, and lamp in it for him. That way, he can stay there whenever he comes to visit."
12:4:11:One day, Elisha returned to Shunem and went up to his room to rest.
12:4:12:He asked his servant Gehazi to call the woman. When she arrived, he said to Gehazi, "Ask her what we can do for her to show our appreciation. Does she need anything from the king or the commander of the army?"
12:4:13:She replied, "I have a home among my own people."
12:4:14:Elisha asked Gehazi, "What can we do for her?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
12:4:15:Elisha told Gehazi to call her back. When she stood at the doorway, he said, "About this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms." She responded, "No, my lord, don't mislead your servant, man of God!"
12:4:16:But sure enough, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son the following year, just as Elisha had told her.
12:4:17:The child grew, and one day while he was out with his father and the harvesters,
12:4:18:he suddenly cried out, "My head! My head!" His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."
12:4:19:The servant took him to his mother, who held him on her lap until noon when he died.
12:4:20:She carried him up to the room of the man of God, laid him on the bed, and left.
12:4:21:Then she called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return."
12:4:22:He asked, "Why are you going to see him today? It's not a new moon or Sabbath." She replied, "Everything will be all right."
12:4:23:She saddled the donkey and told her servant, "Drive fast; don't slow down unless I tell you to."
12:4:24:As she approached Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance and said to Gehazi, "Look! There's the woman from Shunem.
12:4:25:Go to meet her and ask, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?'" She answered, "Everything is all right."
12:4:26:When she reached Elisha, she fell at his feet and begged for help. Gehazi came forward to push her away, but Elisha said, "Leave her alone. She's in deep distress, and the Lord has not revealed it to me."
12:4:27:Then she said, "Did I ask for a son, my lord? Didn't I tell you not to raise my hopes?"
12:4:28:Elisha instructed Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, don't greet them, and if anyone greets you, don't answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."
12:4:29:But the boy's mother said, "As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I won't leave you." So Elisha got up and followed her.
12:4:30:Gehazi went ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no response. He returned to Elisha and reported, "The boy hasn't awakened."
12:4:31:Elisha entered the house, found the boy lying dead on the bed,
12:4:32:and prayed to the Lord. Then he lay on top of the child, putting his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, and his hands on the boy's hands. As he stretched himself out over the boy, the child's body grew warm.
12:4:33:Elisha got up, walked back and forth in the room, and then stretched himself out on the boy again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
12:4:34:Elisha called Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite woman." When she came, he said, "Take your son."
12:4:35:She fell at Elisha's feet, bowed down in gratitude, and then picked up her son and left.
12:4:36:Elisha returned to Gilgal during a famine. As the sons of the prophets were sitting with him, he told his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men."
12:4:37:One of them went out to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, not knowing what they were.
12:4:38:The stew was served to the men, but as they began to eat, they cried out, "Man of God, there's death in the pot!" They couldn't eat it.
12:4:39:Elisha said, "Bring some flour." He threw it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
12:4:40:A man from Baal-shalishah brought Elisha twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said.
12:4:41:His servant asked, "How can I set this before a hundred men?" But Elisha answered, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the Lord says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'"
12:4:42:So the servant set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord.
12:5:1:Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, was highly respected and esteemed by his king, because through him, the Lord had given victory to Syria. He was a brave warrior, but he also suffered from leprosy.
12:5:2:The Syrians had gone on raids and captured a young girl from Israel. She became a servant to Naaman's wife.
12:5:3:One day, she told her mistress, "If only my master would visit the prophet in Samaria! He could heal him of his leprosy."
12:5:4:Naaman heard about this and went to his king, telling him what the girl from Israel had said.
12:5:5:So the king of Syria said, "Go ahead, and I'll send a letter to the king of Israel." Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
12:5:6:He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "With this letter, I'm sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy."
12:5:7:When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, "Am I God, able to give life or take it away? Why does this man send someone to me to be cured of leprosy? Clearly, he's trying to pick a fight with me!"
12:5:8:Elisha, the man of God, heard about the king's distress and sent word to him, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let Naaman come to me, and he will know there is a prophet in Israel."
12:5:9:So Naaman went to Elisha's house with his horses and chariots. He stood at the door of Elisha's house.
12:5:10:Elisha sent a messenger to Naaman, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be cleansed."
12:5:11:But Naaman became angry and left, saying, "I thought he would come out to me, stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place to cure my leprosy.
12:5:12:Aren't the rivers of Damascus, Abana, and Pharpar better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I have washed in them and been cleansed?" So he turned away in a rage.
12:5:13:His servants approached him and said, "Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, wouldn't you have done it? How much more when he simply says, 'Wash and be cleansed'?"
12:5:14:So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan River seven times, as the man of God had instructed. His flesh was restored like that of a young boy, and he was cleansed.
12:5:15:Naaman returned to Elisha with his entire company, and said, "Now I know there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant."
12:5:16:But Elisha replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." Although Naaman urged him to take it, Elisha refused.
12:5:17:Then Naaman said, "If you won't accept my gift, please allow me to take as much earth as two mules can carry, for I will never again make burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god but the Lord.
12:5:18:However, may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm, I must also bow there. May the Lord forgive me for this."
12:5:19:Elisha said to him, "Go in peace." And Naaman departed from him a short distance away.
12:5:20:Gehazi, Elisha's servant, thought to himself, "My master has let Naaman off too easily by not accepting the gifts he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
12:5:21:So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything all right?"
12:5:22:Gehazi answered, "Yes, but my master has sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"
12:5:23:Naaman said, "Please take two talents of silver." He urged Gehazi to accept them, and tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, along with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
12:5:24:When Gehazi arrived at the hill, he took the gifts from the servants and stored them away in the house. Then he sent the men away, and they left.
12:5:25:He went in and stood before his master Elisha, who asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" Gehazi replied, "Your servant didn't go anywhere."
12:5:26:Elisha said to him, "Didn't my spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money or clothes, olive groves or vineyards, sheep or cattle, or male and female servants?
12:5:27:Because of what you have done, Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and your descendants forever." And Gehazi left Elisha's presence, his skin white as snow with leprosy.
12:6:1:One day, the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "The place where we live with you is too small for us.
12:6:2:Let's go to the Jordan River, where each of us can get a log, and we can build a bigger place for us to live." And Elisha agreed.
12:6:3:Then one of them said, "Please come with us, your servants." And Elisha replied, "I will come."
12:6:4:So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees.
12:6:5:But as one of them was cutting a tree, the iron axe head fell into the water. He cried out, "Oh no, my master! It was borrowed!"
12:6:6:Elisha asked, "Where did it fall?" The man showed him the place. Then Elisha cut a stick, threw it in the water, and made the iron axe head float.
12:6:7:He said, "Pick it up." The man reached out and took it.
12:6:8:Meanwhile, the king of Aram was at war with Israel. He consulted with his officers and chose a place to set up an ambush.
12:6:9:But Elisha, the man of God, warned the king of Israel, saying, "Be careful not to pass by this place, because the Arameans are hiding there."
12:6:10:So the king of Israel sent someone to check the area Elisha had mentioned. Time and again, Elisha's warning saved the king from falling into the hands of the Arameans.
12:6:11:The king of Aram became very upset and called his officers together. He demanded, "Which one of you is betraying us to the king of Israel?"
12:6:12:One of his officers replied, "It's not us, my lord the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom."
12:6:13:The king ordered, "Find out where he is, so I can capture him." They told him, "Elisha is in Dothan."
12:6:14:So the king sent horses, chariots, and a strong force to surround the city during the night.
12:6:15:When Elisha's servant got up early in the morning, he saw an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. He cried out, "Oh no, my master! What are we going to do?"
12:6:16:Elisha reassured him, "Don't be afraid, for there are more on our side than on theirs."
12:6:17:Then he prayed, "Lord, please open my servant's eyes so he can see." The Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
12:6:18:As the enemy came down toward them, Elisha prayed, "Lord, strike these people with blindness." And God struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
12:6:19:Elisha told them, "This isn't the right way or the right city. Follow me, and I'll take you to the man you're looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
12:6:20:Once they were inside the city, Elisha prayed, "Lord, open their eyes so they can see." The Lord opened their eyes, and they realized they were in the middle of Samaria, surrounded by the Israelite army.
12:6:21:The king of Israel asked Elisha, "Should I kill them, my father?"
12:6:22:Elisha answered, "No, don't kill them. Would you kill prisoners of war you captured with your own sword or bow? Give them food and water, and let them return to their master."
12:6:23:So the king prepared a great feast for them. After they had eaten and drunk, he sent them back to their master. And the Aramean raiders stopped attacking Israel.
12:6:24:Later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, gathered his entire army and besieged Samaria. This caused a severe famine in the city.
12:6:25:As a result, a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a small amount of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
12:6:26:One day, as the king of Israel was walking on the city wall, a woman cried out to him, "Help me, my lord the king!"
12:6:27:The king replied, "If the Lord doesn't help you, how can I? Can I get help from the threshing floor or the winepress?"
12:6:28:Then he asked her, "What's the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.'
12:6:29:So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Now give up your son so we can eat him,' but she has hidden her son."
12:6:30:When the king heard this, he tore his clothes in distress. As he continued walking on the wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.
12:6:31:He said, "May God punish me severely if Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is not beheaded by this time tomorrow!"
12:6:32:Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders when the king sent a messenger ahead. Before the messenger arrived, Elisha told the elders, "Do you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? When the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Isn't the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?"
12:6:33:While Elisha was still talking, the messenger arrived. The king said, "This disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"
12:7:1:One day, Elisha said to the king, "Listen! The Lord says that by this time tomorrow, a measure of fine flour will sell for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
12:7:2:The officer on whose arm the king was leaning answered the man of God, "Even if the Lord were to open the floodgates of heaven, could this really happen?" "You'll see it with your own eyes," replied Elisha, "but you won't eat any of it."
12:7:3:Now there were four men with leprosy sitting at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why are we just sitting here waiting to die?
12:7:4:If we go into the city, we'll starve because of the famine. If we stay here, we'll still die. So let's go over to the Aramean camp. If they spare us, we'll live; if they kill us, well, we're going to die anyway."
12:7:5:So at twilight, they set out for the Aramean camp. But when they arrived, no one was there.
12:7:6:The Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a large army, so they thought the king of Israel had hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack them.
12:7:7:Panic-stricken, they fled in the twilight, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys, and leaving the camp just as it was.
12:7:8:When the lepers arrived at the edge of the camp, they entered a tent, ate and drank, and took silver, gold, and clothes, hiding them. Then they went into another tent, did the same thing, and hid more valuables.
12:7:9:Finally, they said to each other, "What we're doing isn't right. This is a day of good news, and we're keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, we'll be punished. So let's go and tell the king's household."
12:7:10:They went back and called out to the city gatekeepers, telling them, "We went to the Aramean camp, but there was no one there—not a single person, just horses and donkeys tied up, and tents left as they were."
12:7:11:The gatekeepers shouted the news to the people inside the palace.
12:7:12:The king got up in the night and said to his officers, "I'll tell you what the Arameans have done. They know we're starving, so they've left their camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we'll capture them alive and take the city.'"
12:7:13:One of his officers suggested, "Send some men to take five of the remaining horses and check things out. They're no better off than the rest of us, and if they die, it won't make much difference."
12:7:14:So they chose two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, instructing them, "Go and see what's happened."
12:7:15:They followed the trail of the fleeing Arameans all the way to the Jordan River, finding clothes and equipment that the panicked Arameans had thrown away. Then they returned and reported to the king.
12:7:16:With this news, the people rushed out and plundered the Aramean camp. As Elisha had predicted, a measure of fine flour sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.
12:7:17:The king appointed the officer on whose arm he had leaned to be in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him to death as they rushed out. This fulfilled Elisha's prophecy when he said, "You'll see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat any of it."
12:7:18:And so it happened, just as the man of God had warned the king: "A measure of fine flour will sell for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria by this time tomorrow."
12:7:19:The officer had replied, "Even if the Lord were to open the floodgates of heaven, could this really happen?" To which Elisha had responded, "You'll see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat any of it."
12:7:20:And that's exactly what happened—the people trampled him to death at the gate
12:8:1:Now Elisha had told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, "Get up and leave with your family, and stay wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a seven-year famine that will come upon this land."
12:8:2:So the woman followed Elisha's advice and went with her family to live in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
12:8:3:When the seven years were over, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land.
12:8:4:As she arrived, the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. The king asked him, "Please tell me about all the great things Elisha has done."
12:8:5:While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead boy back to life, the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life."
12:8:6:The king asked the woman about it, and she confirmed the story. So he assigned an official to her case and instructed him, "Restore all that was hers, including all the income from her land since the day she left until now."
12:8:7:Elisha then went to Damascus, where Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, was ill. When he heard that the man of God had come, he sent Hazael, one of his officials, to meet Elisha with gifts and ask if he would recover from his illness.
12:8:8:Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him gifts and forty camel-loads of goods from Damascus. When he arrived, he stood before Elisha and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, has sent me to ask you if he will recover from his illness."
12:8:9:Elisha answered, "Go and tell him, 'You will surely recover.' But the LORD has shown me that he will actually die."
12:8:10:Then Elisha stared at Hazael with a fixed gaze until Hazael felt uncomfortable. Finally, the man of God began to weep.
12:8:11:Hazael asked, "Why are you weeping, my lord?" Elisha replied, "Because I know the terrible things you will do to the Israelites. You will set their fortresses on fire, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women."
12:8:12:Hazael responded, "How could your servant, who is just a mere dog, accomplish such a great feat?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will become king over Aram."
12:8:13:Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master, who asked him, "What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael replied, "He told me that you would surely recover."
12:8:14:But the next day, Hazael took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and smothered the king, so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place.
12:8:15:In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah.
12:8:16:Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
12:8:17:He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, because he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
12:8:18:However, the LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah for the sake of his servant David, as he had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
12:8:19:During Jehoram's reign, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up their own king.
12:8:20:So Jehoram went with all his chariots to Zair. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up at night and broke through their lines, and his troops fled back home.
12:8:21:To this day, Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah also revolted during that time.
12:8:22:As for the other events of Jehoram's reign and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:8:23:Jehoram passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
12:8:24:In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
12:8:25:Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel.
12:8:26:Ahaziah followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just like the house of Ahab, because he was related to them through marriage.
12:8:27:He joined Joram son of Ahab in war against Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram,
12:8:28:and King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth in his battle against Hazael, king of Aram. Ahaziah son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was ill.
12:9:1: Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed by Elisha the prophet to be king over Israel. He said, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anoint you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.
12:9:2: You shall destroy the house of Ahab, your master, so that I may avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and all the servants of the Lord who were killed by Jezebel.
12:9:3: The whole family of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off from him every male, both slave and free, in Israel.
12:9:4: I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah.
12:9:5: As for Jezebel, dogs will eat her body in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her." Then he opened the door and fled.
12:9:6: When Jehu came out to his fellow officers, they asked, "Is everything alright? Why did this madman come to you?" He replied, "You know the kind of man and his talk."
12:9:7: They said, "That's not true! Tell us!" So he told them, "He said this and that to me, declaring, 'The Lord has anointed you king over Israel.'"
12:9:8: Quickly, they each took their garments and spread them under him on the bare steps. They blew the trumpet and proclaimed, "Jehu is king!"
12:9:9: Jehu conspired against Joram, who had been defending Ramoth Gilead against King Hazael of Aram. Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from his wounds.
12:9:10: Jehu said, "If you're on my side, don't let anyone escape from the city to go and warn Jezreel."
12:9:11: Then he mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, where Joram was resting. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also come down to visit him.
12:9:12: The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching and shouted, "I see a group of people!" Joram ordered, "Send a rider to ask if they come in peace."
12:9:13: The rider went out to meet Jehu, who asked, "What do you want with peace? Fall in behind me." The watchman reported that the messenger reached them but hadn't returned.
12:9:14: So Joram sent a second rider, who also asked, "Do you come in peace?" Jehu replied, "What do you want with peace? Fall in behind me."
12:9:15: The watchman reported that the second rider had reached them but hadn't returned either. He added, "The driving style is like that of Jehu, for he drives furiously."
12:9:16: Joram said, "Prepare my chariot!" When it was ready, Joram and Ahaziah rode out to meet Jehu, who was waiting in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
12:9:17: When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is everything peaceful, Jehu?" But Jehu answered, "How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel continue?"
12:9:18: Joram tried to flee, shouting, "Ahaziah, we've been betrayed!" But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
12:9:19: Jehu ordered his aide Bidkar, "Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, as the Lord had prophesied."
12:9:20: When Ahaziah, king of Judah, saw what happened, he fled toward Beth Haggan. Jehu pursued him, shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded him in his chariot on the way to Gur, near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
12:9:21: His servants took him back to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in the city of David.
12:9:22: Then Jehu went to Jezreel, where Jezebel heard of his arrival. She put on makeup, fixed her hair, and looked out the window.
12:9:23: As Jehu entered the city gate, Jezebel called out, "Have you come in peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?"
12:9:24: Jehu looked up at the window and shouted, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
12:9:25: He ordered, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and horses. Jehu trampled her body underfoot.
12:9:26: Afterward, he went inside to eat and drink. Then he said, "Take care of that cursed woman and bury her, for she was a king's daughter."
12:9:27: But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, feet, and hands.
12:9:28: They returned and reported this to Jehu, who said, "This is what the Lord spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'On the plot of ground at Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.
12:9:29: Her corpse will be like dung on the field in the plot of land at Jezreel, so that no one can say, "This is Jezebel."'
12:10:1:Jehu set out for Samaria. Along the way, he met relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They replied, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and the queen mother."
12:10:2:"Capture them alive," Jehu ordered his men. So they captured them and executed all forty-two at the well of Beth-eked, leaving none alive.
12:10:3:Jehu continued on to Samaria, eliminating any remaining members of Ahab's family who were in Jezreel, as the LORD had instructed him through Elijah.
12:10:4:When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed all who remained of Ahab's family, wiping them out completely, just as the LORD had spoken to Elijah.
12:10:5:Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much more."
12:10:6:He then called for a great assembly in honor of Baal and sent word throughout Israel. All the worshippers of Baal came, and the temple was filled from one end to the other.
12:10:7:Jehu ordered the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring out robes for all the servants of Baal." So he brought out their robes.
12:10:8:Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the worshippers of Baal, "Search and make sure there are no servants of the LORD here with you, only servants of Baal."
12:10:9:They proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Meanwhile, Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, warning them, "If any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, you will pay for their life with yours."
12:10:10:As soon as Jehu had finished offering the burnt offerings, he commanded the guards and officers, "Go in and kill them; let none escape." They struck them down with the sword, and the guards and officers threw the bodies out before continuing into the inner room of the temple of Baal.
12:10:11:They brought out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it.
12:10:12:Jehu demolished the temple of Baal, turning it into a latrine, which remains to this day.
12:10:13:Despite his actions against the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin by worshipping the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
12:10:14:The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have eliminated the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
12:10:15:However, Jehu did not carefully follow the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he caused Israel to commit.
12:10:16:In those days, the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory
12:10:17:east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.
12:10:18:The rest of the acts of Jehu, all he did, and his accomplishments are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12:10:19:Jehu passed away and was buried with his ancestors in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king.
12:10:20:Jehu ruled over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years.
12:11:1:In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, began to rule over the land after her son's death. She sought to kill all remaining members of the royal family.
12:11:2:But Jehosheba, King Joram's daughter and sister of Ahaziah, secretly took Joash, Ahaziah's son, from among the king's sons who were being killed, and hid him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus, she saved him from Athaliah's murderous intent, and he remained hidden with her in the Lord's temple for six years.
12:11:3:Athaliah ruled the land during this time.
12:11:4:In the seventh year, Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards, and had them come to the temple of the Lord. There, he made a covenant with them and swore an oath, presenting the king's son to them.
12:11:5:He then instructed them, saying, "This is what you must do: one third of you on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the king's house;
12:11:6:another third shall be stationed at the Sur Gate, and the final third shall be at the gate behind the guards. You will take turns guarding the temple.
12:11:7:The two divisions that are off duty on the Sabbath shall fully protect the Lord's temple for the king.
12:11:8:You must surround the king, each with weapons in hand, and anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."
12:11:9:The commanders followed Jehoiada's orders, bringing their men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—to the priest.
12:11:10:Jehoiada the priest provided the commanders with King David's spears and shields, which were kept in the temple of the Lord.
12:11:11:The guards, armed with weapons, stood from the south side to the north side of the temple, surrounding the altar and the temple to protect the king.
12:11:12:Then Jehoiada brought out Joash, the king's son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of the covenant. They anointed him as king, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"
12:11:13:When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to them at the temple of the Lord.
12:11:14:She saw the king standing by a pillar, as was customary, with the officers and trumpeters beside him, and all the people rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her robes and cried out, "Treason! Treason!"
12:11:15:Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, "Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "She must not be put to death in the temple of the Lord."
12:11:16:They seized her, and as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, they killed her there.
12:11:17:Jehoiada then made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people that they would be the Lord's people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
12:11:18:All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
12:11:19:Jehoiada appointed guards for the temple of the Lord, and took with him the commanders, the Carites, the guards, and all the people. They led the king from the Lord's temple to the palace, entering through the Guards' Gate. Joash took his seat on the royal throne.
12:11:20:All the people rejoiced, and the city was peaceful after Athaliah had been put to death by the sword at the palace.
12:11:21:Joash was seven years old when he became king.
12:12:1:In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash began to rule as king in Jerusalem. He reigned for forty years, and his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba.
12:12:2:Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days he was guided by Jehoiada the priest.
12:12:3:However, the high places were not removed; people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
12:12:4:Joash instructed the priests, "Take all the money brought into the temple of the Lord, whether from taxes, personal offerings, or any other sources, and use it to repair the temple."
12:12:5:But after twenty-three years, the priests still hadn't repaired the temple.
12:12:6:So King Joash summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and the other priests, asking them, "Why haven't you repaired the temple? From now on, don't take any more money from your acquaintances, but hand it over for the repair of the temple."
12:12:7:The priests agreed that they would neither collect money from the people nor repair the temple themselves.
12:12:8:Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance put all the money brought into the temple of the Lord into the chest.
12:12:9:Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest would come, count the money, and put it in bags.
12:12:10:Then they would give the money that had been weighed to those doing the work, who had been appointed over the temple of the Lord. They paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the temple.
12:12:11:The money was also used for the masons and stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and dressed stone for the repair and maintenance of the temple. They spent the money on whatever was needed for the repairs.
12:12:12:No accounting was required from the workers who were given the money, because they acted with honesty.
12:12:13:The money from guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the Lord; it belonged to the priests.
12:12:14:When Hazael king of Aram threatened to attack Jerusalem, King Joash took all the sacred objects dedicated by his predecessors, as well as his own gold and silver, and sent them to Hazael to appease him. So Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.
12:12:15:The other events of Joash's reign, along with all his accomplishments, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah.
12:12:16:Joash's officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the road down to Silla.
12:12:17:His assassins were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. They killed him, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
12:13:1:In the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign in Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu began to rule over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for seventeen years.
12:13:2:Jehoahaz did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he did not turn away from them.
12:13:3:Because of this, the Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He handed them over to Hazael, king of Aram, and his son Ben-Hadad, who continually oppressed Israel.
12:13:4:Jehoahaz pleaded with the Lord for help, and the Lord listened to him, seeing the oppression that the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel.
12:13:5:The Lord provided a deliverer for Israel, enabling them to escape from the power of the Arameans. The Israelites lived in peace and security as they had before,
12:13:6:However, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's house, which led Israel into sin. They continued in those ways, with the Asherah pole still standing in Samaria.
12:13:7:As for the army of Jehoahaz, it was reduced to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers because the king of Aram had destroyed the rest, leaving them like dust at threshing time.
12:13:8:More details about Jehoahaz's life, including his achievements and reign, are recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12:13:9:Jehoahaz passed away and was buried in Samaria with his ancestors. His son Joash succeeded him as king.
12:13:10:In the thirty-seventh year of King Joash's reign in Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz began to rule over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for sixteen years.
12:13:11:Jehoash did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, not turning away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which led Israel into sin; he continued in those ways.
12:13:12:Elisha had become ill with the sickness that would eventually lead to his death. King Joash of Israel went down to visit him and wept over him, saying, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!"
12:13:13:Elisha told him, "Get a bow and some arrows," and Joash did as instructed. Then Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.
12:13:14:Elisha said, "Open the east window," and Joash opened it. Elisha then said, "Shoot!" and Joash shot. Elisha declared, "This is the Lord's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram! You will completely defeat the Arameans at Aphek."
12:13:15:Then Elisha said, "Take the arrows," and Joash took them. Elisha told him, "Strike the ground." Joash struck the ground three times and stopped.
12:13:16:The man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram completely. But now you will only defeat them three times."
12:13:17:Elisha passed away and was buried. Moabite raiders used to invade the land every spring.
12:13:18:Once, as some Israelites were burying a man, they spotted a band of raiders. They quickly threw the man's body into Elisha's tomb. When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came back to life and stood up on his feet.
12:13:19:King Hazael of Aram oppressed Israel throughout Jehoahaz's reign, 
12:13:20:but the Lord was gracious to them, compassionate and attentive to their cry, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not want to destroy them or cast them from His presence.
12:13:21:When King Hazael of Aram died, his son Ben-Hadad succeeded him as king.
12:13:22:Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the cities that had been taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Joash defeated Ben-Hadad and recovered the cities of Israel.
12:14:1:In the second year of King Joash's reign over Israel, Amaziah son of Joash began to rule over Judah.
12:14:2:He was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.
12:14:3:Amaziah did what was right in the Lord's eyes, but not with complete devotion like his ancestor David. He followed the example of his father Joash.
12:14:4:However, the high places were not removed; people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
12:14:5:As soon as the kingdom was firmly under his control, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father, the king.
12:14:6:But he did not put their children to death, following the command found in the Law of Moses, where the Lord commanded: "Parents must not be put to death for their children's sins, nor children for their parents' sins. Each person will die for their own sin."
12:14:7:Amaziah defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle, renaming it Joktheel, which remains its name to this day.
12:14:8:Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, challenging him to face him in battle.
12:14:9:But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
12:14:10:You have indeed defeated Edom, and you have become arrogant. Enjoy your victory, but stay at home. Why invite disaster and bring ruin on yourself and your people?"
12:14:11:But Amaziah refused to listen, so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
12:14:12:Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
12:14:13:Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about six hundred feet long.
12:14:14:He took all the gold and silver, and all the articles found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
12:14:15:The remaining events of Jehoash's reign, along with his accomplishments and his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12:14:16:Jehoash rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son Jeroboam succeeded him as king.
12:14:17:Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
12:14:18:As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
12:14:19:A conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But his enemies sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
12:14:20:His body was brought back on horses, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David in Jerusalem.
12:14:21:All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
12:14:22:Azariah was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his ancestors.
12:14:23:In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for forty-one years.
12:14:24:He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
12:14:25:Jeroboam restored the boundaries of Israel
12:14:26:He was the one who recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel, which had belonged to Judah. This was according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.
12:14:27:The other events of Jeroboam's reign, all his accomplishments, and how he waged war and recovered Damascus and Hamath for Israel are recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
12:14:28:Jeroboam rested with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. His son Zechariah succeeded him as king.
12:15:1:In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam's reign in Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah began his rule over Judah.
12:15:2:He was only sixteen years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jecoliah, who was from Jerusalem.
12:15:3:Azariah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.
12:15:4:However, the high places were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
12:15:5:The Lord afflicted the king with leprosy until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king's son, was in charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
12:15:6:As for the other events of Azariah's reign, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:15:7:When Azariah passed away, they buried him with his ancestors in the City of David, and his son Jotham succeeded him as king.
12:15:8:In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for six months.
12:15:9:He did evil in the sight of the Lord, as his predecessors had done. He refused to turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin.
12:15:10:Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, assassinated him in public, and took over the throne.
12:15:11:Regarding the rest of the events of Zechariah's reign, they are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12:15:12:This fulfilled the word of the Lord that he had spoken to Jehu, saying, "Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
12:15:13:Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah, and he ruled for one month in Samaria.
12:15:14:Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah to Samaria, attacked Shallum son of Jabesh, killed him, and took his place as king.
12:15:15:Concerning the other events of Shallum's reign, and the conspiracy he led, these are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12:15:16:From Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah and everyone in the city and its vicinity, because they did not open their gates. He sacked the city and ripped open all the pregnant women.
12:15:17:In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Menahem son of Gadi began his rule over Israel, and he reigned for ten years in Samaria.
12:15:18:He did evil in the sight of the Lord, never turning away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin.
12:15:19:Pul, the king of Assyria, invaded the land, so Menahem gave him a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and strengthen his own hold on the kingdom.
12:15:20:Menahem exacted this money from the wealthy people of Israel, forcing each of them to contribute fifty shekels of silver. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not stay there in the land.
12:15:21:The rest of the events of Menahem's reign, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12:15:22:When Menahem passed away, his son Pekahiah succeeded him as king.
12:15:23:In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for two years.
12:15:24:Pekahiah did evil in the Lord's sight, refusing to turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin.
12:15:25:Pekah son of Remaliah, one of his officers, conspired against him. With fifty men from Gilead, Pekah assassinated the king, along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the royal palace in Samaria. Pekah then took over the throne.
12:15:26:The other events of Pekahiah's reign, and all that he did, are recorded in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
12:15:27:In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for twenty years.
12:15:28:Pekah did evil in the sight of the Lord, never turning away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin.
12:15:29:During Pekah's reign, King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria attacked Israel. He captured Ijon, Abel Beth Maakah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and the entire territory of Naphtali, deporting the people to Assyria.
12:15:30:Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah and assassinated him. He then succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
12:15:31:The rest of the events of Pekah's reign, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
12:15:32:Jotham son of Uzziah was king of Judah during the time when Pekah was ruling Israel. He began his reign in the second year of Pekah's rule over Israel, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
12:15:33:Jotham did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just like his father Uzziah had done.
12:15:34:However, the high places were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the Lord.
12:15:35:The other events of Jotham's reign, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:15:36:In those days, the Lord began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
12:15:37:When Jotham passed away, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king.
12:16:1:In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah.
12:16:2:Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his ancestor David had done.
12:16:3:Instead, he followed the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his own son in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
12:16:4:He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
12:16:5:Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war against Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz but could not overpower him.
12:16:6:At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram by driving out the people of Judah. The Edomites then moved into Elath, and they have lived there to this day.
12:16:7:Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hands of the king of Aram and the king of Israel, who are attacking me."
12:16:8:Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace, and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
12:16:9:The king of Assyria responded to his request; he attacked Damascus and captured it. He deported its inhabitants to Kir and put Rezin to death.
12:16:10:King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. When he saw the altar in Damascus, he sent a model and detailed plans of it to Uriah the priest.
12:16:11:Uriah the priest built an altar according to the plans King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus, and he completed it before King Ahaz returned.
12:16:12:When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and offered sacrifices on it.
12:16:13:He burned his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and splashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar.
12:16:14:He also moved the bronze altar that was before the Lord from the front of the temple - between the new altar and the temple of the Lord - and put it on the north side of the new altar.
12:16:15:Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, "On the large new altar, offer the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king's burnt offering and grain offering, and the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings. Splash against this altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance."
12:16:16:Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
12:16:17:King Ahaz removed the side panels and basins from the movable stands, and he took down the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it, setting it on a stone base.
12:16:18:He also removed the Sabbath canopy that had been built at the temple, as well as the royal entryway outside the temple of the Lord, in response to the king of Assyria's threats.
12:16:19:The rest of the events of Ahaz's reign, and all his accomplishments, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah.
12:16:20:Ahaz passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.
12:17:1:In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, ruling for nine years.
12:17:2:He did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as much as the kings who came before him.
12:17:3:King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked Hoshea, who became his servant and paid him tribute.
12:17:4:But Hoshea conspired against the king of Assyria by sending envoys to So, king of Egypt, and not paying the annual tribute to the king of Assyria. When Shalmaneser discovered this, he arrested Hoshea and put him in prison.
12:17:5:The king of Assyria invaded the whole land, attacked Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
12:17:6:In the ninth year of Hoshea's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria, settling them in Halah, on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
12:17:7:This happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God, who brought them out of Egypt from the power of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. They worshipped other gods,
12:17:8:following the customs of the nations the Lord had driven out before them, as well as the practices introduced by the kings of Israel.
12:17:9:The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. They built high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.
12:17:10:They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
12:17:11:At all the high places, they burned incense like the nations the Lord had expelled before them. They did wicked things that provoked the Lord to anger,
12:17:12:and they served idols, even though the Lord had told them, "You must not do this."
12:17:13:The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and statutes, according to the entire law I commanded your ancestors and sent to you through my servants the prophets."
12:17:14:But they would not listen and were as stubborn as their ancestors who did not trust in the Lord their God.
12:17:15:They rejected his statutes and the covenant he made with their ancestors, along with the warnings he had given them. They pursued worthless idols, becoming worthless themselves, and imitated the nations around them, even though the Lord had ordered them not to.
12:17:16:They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God, making for themselves two cast idols of calves, an Asherah pole, and worshipping the whole heavenly host and serving Baal.
12:17:17:They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire, practiced divination and sorcery, and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, provoking him to anger.
12:17:18:So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained,
12:17:19:but even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God. They followed the customs Israel had introduced.
12:17:20:So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and handed them over to plunderers until he finally banished them from his presence.
12:17:21:When the Lord tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam led Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit great sin.
12:17:22:The Israelites persisted in all the sins Jeroboam had committed; they did not turn away from them
12:17:23:until the Lord removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were exiled from their homeland to Assyria, where they remain to this day.
12:17:24:The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria, replacing the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns.
12:17:25:At first, they did not worship the Lord, so he sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
12:17:26:The king of Assyria was informed, "The nations you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land, so he has sent lions among them, which are killing them because they do not know the customs of the God of the land."
12:17:27:So the king of Assyria ordered, "Send back one of the priests you deported from Samaria, and let him live there and teach them the customs of the God of the land."
12:17:28:One of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria returned and settled in Bethel. He taught the people how to worship the Lord.
12:17:29:Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the towns they occupied, and set them up in the high places the Samaritans had made.
12:17:30:The people of Babylon made Sukkoth-benoth, the people of Cuthah made Nergal, the people of Hamath made Ashima,
12:17:31:the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim.
12:17:32:They also worshipped the Lord, but appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.
12:17:33:So they feared the Lord, but also served their own gods, following the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
12:17:34:To this day, they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the Lord nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws, and the commandments that the Lord gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
12:17:35:The Lord had made a covenant with them and commanded them, "Do not worship other gods or bow down to them, serve them, or sacrifice to them.
12:17:36:But you shall worship the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Bow down to him, offer sacrifices to him, and obey his commandments.
12:17:37:You must always be careful to keep the decrees, regulations, laws, and commandments he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
12:17:38:Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.
12:17:39:Rather, worship the Lord your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
12:17:40:But they would not listen and continued their former practices.
12:17:41:Even while these people were worshipping the Lord, they were serving their idols. To this day, their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did.
12:18:1:In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began his reign.
12:18:2:He was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi, daughter of Zechariah.
12:18:3:He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done.
12:18:4:He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones, and cut down the Asherah poles. He also broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, because up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. He called it Nehushtan.
12:18:5:Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after him.
12:18:6:He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following Him; he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses.
12:18:7:The Lord was with him, and he prospered wherever he went. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him.
12:18:8:He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
12:18:9:In the fourth year of King Hezekiah's reign, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.
12:18:10:At the end of three years, the Assyrians captured Samaria in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
12:18:11:The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, on the Habor River in Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes.
12:18:12:This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God but violated His covenant—all that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. They neither listened nor obeyed.
12:18:13:In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
12:18:14:Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand." The king of Assyria demanded from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
12:18:15:So Hezekiah gave him all the silver found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
12:18:16:At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord and from the doorposts he had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
12:18:17:The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer, and his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced and came up to Jerusalem, stopping at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field.
12:18:18:They called for the king, and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.
12:18:19:The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: 'What is the basis for your confidence?
12:18:20:You say you have strategy and military strength, but these are empty words. On whom are you depending that you would rebel against me?
12:18:21:Look now, you're depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
12:18:22:But if you say to me, "We trust in the Lord our God," isn't He the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, telling Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?
12:18:23:Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
12:18:24:How can you repel one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
12:18:25:Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the Lord? The Lord Himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"
12:18:26:Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
12:18:27:But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?"
12:18:28:Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
12:18:29:This is what the king says: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.
12:18:30:Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, "The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12:18:31:Do not listen to Hezekiah. For this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
12:18:32:until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, "The Lord will deliver us."
12:18:33:Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
12:18:34:Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
12:18:35:Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
12:18:36:But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."
12:18:37:Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said.
12:19:1:When King Hezekiah heard the news, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the Lord's temple.
12:19:2:He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
12:19:3:They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for we are like children unable to give birth, and there is no strength to deliver.
12:19:4:Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to insult the living God. Maybe He will punish him for what he has heard. So pray for the remnant that still survives."
12:19:5:When Isaiah received the message from King Hezekiah's officials,
12:19:6:Isaiah replied, "Tell your master this: The Lord says, 'Don't be afraid because of the words you've heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
12:19:7:Look, I will cause a spirit to enter him, and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. There, I will cause him to fall by the sword.'"
12:19:8:The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
12:19:9:Now, when the king of Assyria heard about Tirhakah, king of Cush, he said, "He has come out to fight against you." So again, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this message:
12:19:10:"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Don't let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
12:19:11:You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, completely destroying them. Will you be saved?
12:19:12:Did the gods of the nations my predecessors destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar—rescue them?
12:19:13:Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena and Ivvah?"
12:19:14:Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the Lord's temple and spread it out before the Lord.
12:19:15:Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying: "Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth.
12:19:16:Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see. Listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
12:19:17:Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands.
12:19:18:They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
12:19:19:Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, O Lord, are God."
12:19:20:Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
12:19:21:This is the word that the Lord has spoken against him: 'The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.
12:19:22:Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
12:19:23:Through your messengers you have taunted the Lord, saying, "With my many chariots I ascended the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I reached its farthest heights, the finest of its forests.
12:19:24:I dug wells and drank foreign waters; I dried up with the soles of my feet all
12:19:25:the rivers of Egypt."
12:19:26:But have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it; in days of old I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should turn fortified cities into piles of rubble.
12:19:27:Their inhabitants, powerless, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
12:19:28:But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.
12:19:29:Because you rage against me and your arrogance has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.'
12:19:30:This will be a sign for you, Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
12:19:31:The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
12:19:32:For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
12:19:33:Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: 'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
12:19:34:By the way he came, he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the Lord.
12:19:35:I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'"
12:19:36:That night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!
12:19:37:So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
12:19:38:One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
12:20:1:At that time, Hezekiah became deathly ill. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, visited him and said, "The Lord says you should put your affairs in order, for you will die and not recover."
12:20:2:Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
12:20:3:"Please, Lord, remember how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, doing what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
12:20:4:Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him:
12:20:5:"Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now, you will go up to the temple of the Lord.'"
12:20:6:"And I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David."
12:20:7:Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of figs." They did so and applied it to the boil, and Hezekiah recovered.
12:20:8:Hezekiah asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord on the third day?"
12:20:9:Isaiah answered, "This is the sign to you from the Lord, that he will do what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?"
12:20:10:"It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps," said Hezekiah. "Rather, have it go back ten steps."
12:20:11:Then the prophet Isaiah called on the Lord, and he made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
12:20:12:At that time, Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.
12:20:13:Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oil—his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
12:20:14:Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant land, from Babylon."
12:20:15:Isaiah asked, "What did they see in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They saw everything in my palace. There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
12:20:16:Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord:
12:20:17:'The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says the Lord.
12:20:18:'And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
12:20:19:"The word of the Lord you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?"
12:20:20:As for the other events of Hezekiah's reign, all his achievements and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:20:21:Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
12:21:1:Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
12:21:2:He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, following the detestable practices of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
12:21:3:Manasseh rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He set up altars for Baal, made an Asherah pole as Ahab king of Israel had done, and bowed down to all the stars in the sky and served them.
12:21:4:He built altars in the house of the LORD, even though the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put my Name."
12:21:5:In the two courtyards of the house of the LORD, Manasseh built altars for all the stars in the sky.
12:21:6:He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
12:21:7:Manasseh also placed a carved image of the idol he had made in the temple, which God had said to David and Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever."
12:21:8:"I will not make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their ancestors, if only they are careful to do everything I commanded them and follow the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them."
12:21:9:But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
12:21:10:The LORD spoke through his servants the prophets, saying,
12:21:11:"Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable acts, doing more evil than all the Amorites who were before him and leading Judah into sin with his idols,"
12:21:12:"I will bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears about it will tingle."
12:21:13:"I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
12:21:14:"I will abandon the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of their enemies. They will become prey and plunder for all their enemies."
12:21:15:"This is because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this very day."
12:21:16:Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin he caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the sight of the LORD.
12:21:17:As for the other events of Manasseh's reign, all he did, and the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:21:18:Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his own palace, the garden of Uzza. His son Amon succeeded him as king.
12:21:19:Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled for two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
12:21:20:He did evil in the LORD's sight, just as his father Manasseh had done.
12:21:21:Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols that Manasseh his father had made.
12:21:22:He abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in obedience to him.
12:21:23:Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.
12:21:24:The people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
12:21:25:As for the other events of Amon's reign and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
12:21:26:Amon was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. His son Josiah succeeded him as king.
12:22:1:In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, Hilkiah the high priest found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.
12:22:2:Josiah was only eight years old when he became king, and he ruled for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath.
12:22:3:He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of his ancestor David without deviating to the right or left.
12:22:4:One day, King Josiah ordered Hilkiah the high priest, along with the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers, to clean up the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord.
12:22:5:He told them to give the money to the workers who were appointed to repair the temple, so they could use it to pay carpenters, builders, and masons, as well as to buy timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.
12:22:6:However, no accounting was required from those who received the money, since they were honest in their work.
12:22:7:During the cleanup, Hilkiah the high priest discovered the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.
12:22:8:Hilkiah informed Shaphan the secretary, saying, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord." Then he gave the book to Shaphan.
12:22:9:Shaphan took the book to the king and reported, "Your officials are doing everything you instructed. They have paid out the money that was found in the temple and handed it over to the workers and supervisors at the temple."
12:22:10:Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
12:22:11:When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in distress.
12:22:12:King Josiah then gave orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's attendant, saying,
12:22:13:"Go and inquire of the Lord for me, for the people, and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. For the Lord's wrath must be great because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book or do everything written here concerning us."
12:22:14:Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to speak with the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
12:22:15:Huldah told them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
12:22:16:that I will indeed bring disaster on this place and its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.
12:22:17:Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods, provoking me with their deeds, my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.'
12:22:18:But tell King Josiah of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:
12:22:19:Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people—that they would become a curse and be laid waste—and because you tore your clothes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the Lord.
12:22:20:Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" So they took her message back to the king.
12:23:1:In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the Lord's temple, saying,
12:23:2:"Go up to Hilkiah, the high priest, and have him count the money that has been brought into the house of the Lord, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
12:23:3:Then, give the money to the workers who oversee the repairs of the Lord's house.
12:23:4:They should distribute it to the carpenters, builders, and masons who are working on the temple, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for the repairs.
12:23:5:However, no accounting is necessary for the funds given to the workmen, since they are honest in their dealings."
12:23:6:Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord." Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it.
12:23:7:Shaphan then went to King Josiah and reported, "Your servants have gathered the money found in the temple and have given it to those in charge of the repair work."
12:23:8:He also told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it aloud to the king.
12:23:9:When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.
12:23:10:He ordered Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant,
12:23:11:"Go and inquire of the Lord for me, for the people, and for all Judah about the words in this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, nor act according to all that is written concerning us."
12:23:12:Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to speak with Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
12:23:13:They spoke with her, and she said to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,
12:23:14:'The Lord says this: I will bring disaster on this place and its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.
12:23:15:Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all the work of their hands, my wrath will be kindled against this place and will not be quenched.'
12:23:16:However, tell King Josiah of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Because you heard the words of the book,
12:23:17:and your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I spoke against this place and its inhabitants—that they would become a desolation and a curse—and you tore your clothes and wept before me, I have also heard you, declares the Lord.
12:23:18:Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place.'" They brought her message back to the king.
12:24:1:In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to power, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. But then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled.
12:24:2:The Lord sent raiding bands from the Chaldeans, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against Judah to destroy it, as He had warned through His servants the prophets.
12:24:3:This happened to Judah according to the Lord's command, in order to remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done,
12:24:4:including the innocent blood he had shed, filling Jerusalem with it; so the Lord was unwilling to forgive.
12:24:5:As for the other events of Jehoiakim's reign, along with all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12:24:6:Jehoiakim passed away, and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king.
12:24:7:The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
12:24:8:Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
12:24:9:He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father had done.
12:24:10:At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem, and the city came under siege.
12:24:11:Nebuchadnezzar himself arrived at the city while his servants were besieging it.
12:24:12:Jehoiachin king of Judah, along with his mother, his officials, and the nobles, surrendered to the king of Babylon. In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
12:24:13:As the Lord had declared, Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and cut up the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple.
12:24:14:He carried into exile all Jerusalem's people, including the commanders, mighty warriors, craftsmen, and metalworkers—ten thousand in total. Only the poorest people of the land were left behind.
12:24:15:Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with his mother, wives, officials, and the leading men of the land.
12:24:16:The king of Babylon also deported seven thousand warriors, a thousand skilled craftsmen and metalworkers, all strong and fit for war.
12:24:17:Then he installed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, as king in his place, changing his name to Zedekiah.
12:24:18:Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
12:24:19:Zedekiah did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done.
12:24:20:It was because of the Lord's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end, He cast them out of His presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12:25:1:In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They besieged the city and built a siege wall around it.
12:25:2:The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
12:25:3:On the ninth day of the fourth month, when famine had become severe in the city and there was no food for the people,
12:25:4:the defenders of the city broke through the wall. That night, King Zedekiah and all his soldiers fled by way of the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians surrounded the city. They headed toward the Arabah.
12:25:5:But the Babylonian army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his troops were scattered from him.
12:25:6:They captured Zedekiah and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment upon him.
12:25:7:There, they killed Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, then gouged out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
12:25:8:On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
12:25:9:He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
12:25:10:The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard tore down the walls around Jerusalem.
12:25:11:Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the rest of the population and those who had defected to the king of Babylon.
12:25:12:However, the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
12:25:13:The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands, and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
12:25:14:They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
12:25:15:The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—all that were made of pure gold or silver.
12:25:16:Regarding the two pillars, the one Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD—the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.
12:25:17:Each pillar was eighteen cubits high. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was three cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its network, was similar.
12:25:18:The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three doorkeepers.
12:25:19:He also took from the city one official who was in charge of the fighting men, five royal advisers found in the city, the secretary who was in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city.
12:25:20:Nebuzaradan, the commander, took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12:25:21:There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.
12:25:22:Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in Judah.
12:25:23:When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men.
12:25:24:Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men, saying, "Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
12:25:25:But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
12:25:26:At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
12:25:27:In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
12:25:28:He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
12:25:29:Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and for the rest of his life, he ate regularly at the king's table.
12:25:30:Day by day, the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.
