58:1:1:In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways.
58:1:2:But now, in these final days, He has spoken to us through His Son, whom He appointed as heir of all things and through whom He made the universe.
58:1:3:The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After providing purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
58:1:4:Being much greater than the angels, He has inherited a name far more excellent than theirs.
58:1:5:For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? And again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?
58:1:6:Moreover, when God brings His firstborn into the world, He says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58:1:7:Speaking of the angels, He says, "He makes His angels winds, and His servants flames of fire."
58:1:8:However, about the Son He says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom."
58:1:9:"You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."
58:1:10:He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands."
58:1:11:They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
58:1:12:Like a robe, you will roll them up, and like a garment, they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."
58:1:13:To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
58:1:14:Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
58:2:1:For this reason, we must pay even more attention to what we've heard, so that we don't drift away from it.
58:2:2:If the message spoken by angels was reliable, and every violation and disobedience received a just punishment,
58:2:3:how can we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, then confirmed to us by those who heard Him.
58:2:4:God also testified to it by signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.
58:2:5:It's not to angels that God has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
58:2:6:Instead, someone has testified somewhere, saying, "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, or the son of man that you care for him?
58:2:7:You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor
58:2:8:and put everything under his feet." In putting everything under him, God left nothing outside of his control. But at present, we don't yet see everything subject to him.
58:2:9:However, we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a short time, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58:2:10:In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.
58:2:11:The one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. That's why Jesus isn't ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
58:2:12:He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly, I will sing your praises."
58:2:13:And again, "I will put my trust in him." And once more, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."
58:2:14:Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy the one who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—
58:2:15:and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
58:2:16:For surely it's not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.
58:2:17:For this reason, he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and make atonement for the sins of the people.
58:2:18:Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
58:3:1:Therefore, my fellow believers, you who are called to be part of God's heavenly household, think about Jesus, the one we acknowledge as our Apostle and High Priest.
58:3:2:He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all of God's house.
58:3:3:Yet, Jesus is worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
58:3:4:Every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
58:3:5:Moses was faithful as a servant within God's house, testifying to what would later be revealed.
58:3:6:However, Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.
58:3:7:As the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
58:3:8:do not harden your hearts as you did during the rebellion, on that day of testing in the wilderness,
58:3:9:where your ancestors tested me, trying my patience even though they saw my works for forty years.
58:3:10:Because of this, I was angry with that generation and said, 'Their hearts always go astray, and they have not known my ways.'
58:3:11:So I declared an oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"
58:3:12:Beware, brothers and sisters, that none of you develops an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to turn away from the living God.
58:3:13:Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.
58:3:14:For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end,
58:3:15:as it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
58:3:16:Who were those who heard and rebelled? Weren't they all the ones Moses led out of Egypt?
58:3:17:And with whom was God angry for forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?
58:3:18:To whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed?
58:3:19:So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief.
58:4:1:Therefore, let us be cautious that none of you should fall short of entering God's rest, as was promised.
58:4:2:For we have heard the good news just as they did; but the message they heard didn't benefit them, since it wasn't combined with faith in those who heard it.
58:4:3:We who believe enter into that rest, as God said, "So I swore in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest,'" even though his works were completed from the foundation of the world.
58:4:4:For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
58:4:5:And again in this passage: "They shall never enter my rest."
58:4:6:Since it still remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
58:4:7:God again sets a certain day, today, when he says through David after such a long time, just as it has been said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58:4:8:For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
58:4:9:So there remains a Sabbath-rest for the people of God.
58:4:10:For whoever enters God's rest also rests from their own work, just as God did from his.
58:4:11:Let us, then, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
58:4:12:For the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
58:4:13:Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
58:4:14:Since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
58:4:15:For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.
58:4:16:Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
58:5:1:In this context, every high priest is chosen from among people and appointed to represent them in matters related to God, offering gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58:5:2:He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is also subject to weakness.
58:5:3:Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for the sins of the people.
58:5:4:No one takes on this honor by themselves; they must be called by God, just as Aaron was.
58:5:5:So too, Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but it was God who said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father."
58:5:6:And in another passage, God declares, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
58:5:7:During his earthly life, Jesus offered up prayers and petitions, with loud cries and tears, to the One who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
58:5:8:Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.
58:5:9:And once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
58:5:10:being designated by God as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
58:5:11:We have much to say about this topic, but it's difficult to explain since you've become slow to understand.
58:5:12:By now, you should be teachers yourselves, but instead, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word again. You have come to need milk, not solid food.
58:5:13:Anyone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't understand the teaching about righteousness.
58:5:14:But solid food is for the mature, who through constant practice have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
58:6:1:Let's move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, faith in God,
58:6:2:instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58:6:3:With God's help, we will do this.
58:6:4:For it is impossible to restore those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, shared in the Holy Spirit,
58:6:5:experienced the goodness of God's word and the powers of the coming age, if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.
58:6:6:Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
58:6:7:But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end, it will be burned.
58:6:8:Yet, we are convinced of better things in your case, dear friends—things that accompany salvation.
58:6:9:Even though we speak like this, we are confident that you possess everything needed for a better outcome, because God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
58:6:10:We want each of you to show the same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized.
58:6:11:Do not become lazy, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
58:6:12:When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,
58:6:13:saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."
58:6:14:And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
58:6:15:People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
58:6:16:Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.
58:6:17:Thus, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.
58:6:18:We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
58:6:19:where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
58:7:1:Melchizedek was both king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him.
58:7:2:To him, Abraham gave a tenth part of everything. His name means "king of righteousness," and also "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
58:7:3:Without father or mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, Melchizedek remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.
58:7:4:Consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils!
58:7:5:The descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their fellow Israelites, even though they also are descended from Abraham.
58:7:6:But Melchizedek, who did not trace his descent from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
58:7:7:Without any doubt, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
58:7:8:In the one case, mortal men receive tithes; but in the other, someone of whom it is testified that he lives.
58:7:9:One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,
58:7:10:because when Melchizedek met him, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
58:7:11:If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?
58:7:12:For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.
58:7:13:He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
58:7:14:For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58:7:15:And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,
58:7:16:one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the power of an indestructible life.
58:7:17:For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
58:7:18:The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
58:7:19:(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
58:7:20:And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
58:7:21:but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'"
58:7:22:Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
58:7:23:Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;
58:7:24:but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
58:7:25:Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.
58:7:26:Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
58:7:27:Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
58:7:28:For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
58:8:1:Now the main point of what we're discussing is this: We have a high priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven.
58:8:2:A minister he is, in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not humans.
58:8:3:For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it is necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
58:8:4:If he were on earth, he wouldn't even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.
58:8:5:These earthly priests serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to construct the tabernacle. God said, "See that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain."
58:8:6:But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry, by being the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
58:8:7:If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second one to replace it.
58:8:8:However, finding fault with the people, God says: "Look, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
58:8:9:not like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt. They did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I turned away from them, says the Lord.
58:8:10:For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts; I will be their God, and they will be my people.
58:8:11:No longer will anyone teach their neighbor or say to their brother, 'Know the Lord,' for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58:8:12:For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoing, and I will remember their sins no more."
58:8:13:By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
58:9:1:Now, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
58:9:2:A tabernacle was prepared: in its first section were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
58:9:3:Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,
58:9:4:which contained the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered Ark of the Covenant. Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
58:9:5:Above the ark were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
58:9:6:With everything arranged like this, the priests regularly entered the outer room to perform their ritual duties.
58:9:7:But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that just once a year, carrying blood that he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
58:9:8:By this arrangement, the Holy Spirit revealed that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
58:9:9:This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
58:9:10:They were only a matter of food and drink, and various ceremonial washings—external regulations imposed until the time of the new order.
58:9:11:However, when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, not a part of this creation.
58:9:12:He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.
58:9:13:The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
58:9:14:How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!
58:9:15:For this reason, Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
58:9:16:In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,
58:9:17:because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
58:9:18:That is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
58:9:19:When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
58:9:20:He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep."
58:9:21:In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.
58:9:22:In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58:9:23:It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58:9:24:For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.
58:9:25:Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
58:9:26:Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58:9:27:Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,
58:9:28:so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. FINISHED
58:10:1:Since the Law has only a shadow of the good things to come, not the actual form of these realities, it can never perfect those who draw near by the same sacrifices they continually offer year after year.
58:10:2:Otherwise, would they not have stopped offering them? For the worshippers, once purified, would no longer feel guilty for their sins.
58:10:3:But in reality, these sacrifices serve as an annual reminder of sins,
58:10:4:because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58:10:5:Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
58:10:6:burnt offerings and sin offerings you took no pleasure in.
58:10:7:Then I said, 'Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—I have come to do your will, O God.'"
58:10:8:First, he says, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (though they were offered according to the Law).
58:10:9:Then he adds, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He cancels the first to establish the second.
58:10:10:By that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58:10:11:Every priest stands daily ministering and repeatedly offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58:10:12:But this one, after offering a single sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God,
58:10:13:waiting from then on until his enemies are made his footstool.
58:10:14:For by one offering, he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
58:10:15:The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this, for after saying,
58:10:16:"This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,"
58:10:17:he then adds, "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
58:10:18:And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any need for a sacrifice for sin.
58:10:19:So, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
58:10:20:by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
58:10:21:and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58:10:22:let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
58:10:23:Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
58:10:24:And let us consider how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
58:10:25:not neglecting to meet together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
58:10:26:If we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remains no sacrifice for sins,
58:10:27:only a fearful expectation of judgment and raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
58:10:28:Anyone who rejected the Law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58:10:29:How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and insulted the Spirit of grace?
58:10:30:For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58:10:31:It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58:10:32:Remember those earlier days when you had received the light, and endured a great conflict full of suffering.
58:10:33:Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times, you stood side by side with those who were being treated so badly.
58:10:34:You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
58:10:35:So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
58:10:36:You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
58:10:37:For, "In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay."
58:10:38:And, "But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back."
58:10:39:But we are not among those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.
58:11:1:Now, faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen.
58:11:2:Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval from God.
58:11:3:Through faith, we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen came into being from things that are invisible.
58:11:4:Abel, by his faith, offered a better sacrifice to God than Cain, and through it he was declared righteous; God testifying about his gifts, even though he is dead, his faith still speaks.
58:11:5:Enoch was taken up by faith, so he did not experience death. He could not be found because God took him away. Before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
58:11:6:Without faith, it is impossible to please God. For whoever comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who diligently seek Him.
58:11:7:Noah, warned by God about events not yet seen, acted in reverent fear and built an ark to save his family. By his faith, he condemned the world and became heir to the righteousness that comes through faith.
58:11:8:Abraham, called by faith, obeyed and went to a place he would receive as an inheritance, even though he didn't know where he was going.
58:11:9:By faith, Abraham lived as a foreigner in the promised land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were also heirs of the same promise.
58:11:10:He looked forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58:11:11:Sarah, through faith, received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, because she believed that the One who promised was faithful.
58:11:12:And so, from one man—already as good as dead—came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
58:11:13:All these people died in faith without receiving the promises, but they saw them from afar and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and exiles on earth.
58:11:14:For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
58:11:15:If they had been thinking of the land they left behind, they would have had opportunity to return.
58:11:16:Instead, they longed for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
58:11:17:Abraham, when tested, offered up Isaac by faith. Yes, he who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his only son,
58:11:18:Of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."
58:11:19:He reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death.
58:11:20:By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning their future.
58:11:21:Jacob, when dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, worshiping as he leaned on the top of his staff.
58:11:22:Joseph, at the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his bones.
58:11:23:Moses' parents hid him for three months after his birth because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were unafraid of the king's edict.
58:11:24:By faith, Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
58:11:25:Choosing rather to suffer with God's people than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58:11:26:He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward.
58:11:27:By faith, Moses left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger, and persevered because he saw the invisible God.
58:11:28:Through faith, he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.
58:11:29:The Israelites crossed the Red Sea on dry land by faith, but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
58:11:30:By faith, the walls of Jericho fell after the people had marched around them for seven days.
58:11:31:Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who disobeyed, because she welcomed the spies in peace.
58:11:32:What more shall I say? Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,
58:11:33:Who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
58:11:34:Quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength in weakness, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight.
58:11:35:Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection.
58:11:36:Others endured mocking, flogging, chains, and imprisonment.
58:11:37:They were stoned, sawn in two, killed with the sword; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted, and mistreated—
58:11:38:The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.
58:11:39:All these, though commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised,
58:11:40:Because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.
58:12:1:Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let's throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and run with perseverance the race set before us.
58:12:2:Focusing on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.
58:12:3:Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so you don't grow weary and lose heart.
58:12:4:In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood.
58:12:5:And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as children? "My child, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, nor lose heart when he rebukes you."
58:12:6:For the Lord disciplines those he loves, and chastises every child he accepts.
58:12:7:Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what child is not disciplined by their father?
58:12:8:If you're not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are illegitimate children and not true sons and daughters.
58:12:9:Moreover, we had human fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Shouldn't we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live?
58:12:10:Our earthly fathers disciplined us for a short time as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, so we may share in his holiness.
58:12:11:No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
58:12:12:Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
58:12:13:Make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.
58:12:14:Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.
58:12:15:See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
58:12:16:Ensure that no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
58:12:17:You know that later on, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could find no way to change what he had done, even though he sought the blessing with tears.
58:12:18:You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom, and storm.
58:12:19:Nor to a trumpet blast or a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them.
58:12:20:For they could not bear the command, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."
58:12:21:The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear."
58:12:22:But you have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly.
58:12:23:To the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect.
58:12:24:And to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58:12:25:Be careful not to refuse the One who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we if we turn away from Him who warns us from heaven?
58:12:26:At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens."
58:12:27:The words "once more" indicate the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58:12:28:Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God acceptably with reverence and awe.
58:12:29:For our God is a consuming fire.
58:13:1:Let love for your fellow believers continue.
58:13:2:Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so, some have unknowingly entertained angels.
58:13:3:Remember those who are in prison, as if you were imprisoned with them; and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
58:13:4:Marriage should be honored by everyone, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
58:13:5:Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
58:13:6:So we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?"
58:13:7:Remember your leaders who spoke God's word to you; consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
58:13:8:Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
58:13:9:Do not be carried away by various strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by dietary regulations which have not benefited those who follow them.
58:13:10:We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
58:13:11:The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
58:13:12:And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
58:13:13:Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
58:13:14:For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
58:13:15:Through Jesus, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.
58:13:16:And do not forget to do good and share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
58:13:17:Obey your leaders and submit to their authority, for they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
58:13:18:Pray for us; we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
58:13:19:I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
58:13:20:Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep,
58:13:21:equip you with everything good for doing his will, working in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
58:13:22:Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you quite briefly.
58:13:23:Know that our brother Timothy has been released, and if he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.
58:13:24:Greet all your leaders and all the Lord's people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
58:13:25:May grace be with you all.
