28:1:1:The word of the LORD came to Hosea, son of Beeri, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.
28:1:2:When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, he told him, "Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for the land is committing great adultery by abandoning the LORD."
28:1:3:So Hosea married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave birth to their first son.
28:1:4:Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Name him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
28:1:5:In that day, I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel."
28:1:6:Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. The LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah (meaning 'Not loved'), for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should forgive them.
28:1:7:But I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God."
28:1:8:After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.
28:1:9:And the LORD said, "Name him Lo-Ammi (meaning 'Not my people'), for you are not my people, and I am not your God.
28:1:10:Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'Children of the living God.'
28:1:11:The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel."
28:2:1:Say to your brothers, "My people," and to your sisters, "My loved ones."
28:2:2:Contend with your mother; contend, for she is not my wife, nor am I her husband. Let her remove her prostitution from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts.
28:2:3:Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her as on the day she was born. I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and let her die of thirst.
28:2:4:I will show no love to her children, for they are the children of adultery.
28:2:5:Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, 'I will go after my lovers, who provide me with my bread and water, my wool and linen, my olive oil and my drinks.'
28:2:6:Therefore, I will block her path with thornbushes and build a wall around her so that she cannot find her way.
28:2:7:She will chase her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, 'I will return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now.'
28:2:8:She did not acknowledge that it was I who provided her with grain, new wine, and oil, and lavished on her silver and gold— which they used for Baal.
28:2:9:So I will take back my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take away my wool and my linen, which were to cover her nakedness.
28:2:10:Now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will rescue her out of my hands.
28:2:11:I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her appointed festivals.
28:2:12:I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will turn them into a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.
28:2:13:I will punish her for the days of the Baals when she burned incense to them, decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but forgot about me," declares the Lord.
28:2:14:However, I will allure her, bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
28:2:15:There I will give her back her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. She will respond there as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
28:2:16:In that day," declares the Lord, "you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me 'my master.'
28:2:17:I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; their names will be mentioned no more.
28:2:18:On that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.
28:2:19:I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.
28:2:20:I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the Lord.
28:2:21:In that day I will respond," declares the Lord— "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;
28:2:22:and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
28:2:23:I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called 'Not my loved one.' I will say to those called 'Not my people,' 'You are my people'; and they will say, 'You are my God.'"
28:3:1:Then the Lord said to me, "Go again and show love to a woman who is loved by another man, yet she is an adulteress. Love her just as I have loved the people of Israel, even though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
28:3:2:So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
28:3:3:And I told her, "You must stay with me for many days; you shall not be promiscuous or belong to any other man, and I will be faithful to you as well."
28:3:4:For the people of Israel will live many days without a king or prince, without sacrifices or sacred pillars, and without ephod or household idols.
28:3:5:Afterward, the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.
28:4:1:Hear the word of the LORD, you people of Israel, for the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land: There is no truth, no love, and no knowledge of God in the country.
28:4:2:Only cursing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery are rampant; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28:4:3:Because of this, the land mourns, and every living thing in it withers; the beasts of the field, the birds of the sky, and even the fish of the sea are dying.
28:4:4:But let no one argue or reprove another; your people are like those who contend with the priest.
28:4:5:You will stumble in the day, and the prophet will also stumble with you at night; I will destroy your mother.
28:4:6:My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Since you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I will also ignore your children.
28:4:7:The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change their glory into shame.
28:4:8:They feed on the sins of my people and relish their iniquity.
28:4:9:It will be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
28:4:10:They will eat but not be satisfied; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have abandoned the LORD to devote themselves to prostitution.
28:4:11:Wine and new wine take away understanding.
28:4:12:My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner's rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.
28:4:13:They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore, your daughters turn to prostitution, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
28:4:14:I will not punish your daughters when they become prostitutes, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go off with prostitutes and offer sacrifices with shrine prostitutes. A people without understanding will come to ruin.
28:4:15:Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, do not let Judah become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth-aven, and do not swear, "As surely as the LORD lives!"
28:4:16:The stubbornness of Israel is like a stubborn heifer. How can the LORD feed them like a lamb in a meadow?
28:4:17:Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!
28:4:18:When their carousing is over, they indulge in prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.
28:4:19:A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
28:5:1:Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you people of Israel! Listen, O royal house! For judgment is coming upon you because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor.
28:5:2:Rebels are deeply involved in slaughter; but I will discipline them all.
28:5:3:I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute; Israel has become corrupt.
28:5:4:Their deeds do not allow them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is within them, and they do not acknowledge the LORD.
28:5:5:Israel's arrogance testifies against them; the people of Israel and Ephraim stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them.
28:5:6:With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.
28:5:7:They have betrayed the LORD; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them along with their fields.
28:5:8:Sound the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Raise the battle cry at Beth-aven; lead on, Benjamin!
28:5:9:Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel I declare what is certain.
28:5:10:The leaders of Judah have become like those who move boundary stones; I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water.
28:5:11:Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to follow human precepts.
28:5:12:So I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like decay to the house of Judah.
28:5:13:When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim turned to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound.
28:5:14:For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off with no one to rescue them.
28:5:15:Then I will return to my place until they admit their guilt and seek my face; in their distress they will earnestly seek me.
28:6:1:Come, let's return to the Lord; for he has torn us, but he will heal us; he has struck us down, but he will bind our wounds.
28:6:2:After two days, he will revive us; on the third day, he will raise us up, so that we may live in his presence.
28:6:3:Let's strive to know the Lord; his coming is as certain as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.
28:6:4:What should I do with you, Ephraim? What should I do with you, Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that vanishes early.
28:6:5:This is why I have cut them down through the prophets; I have slain them with the words of my mouth. My judgment goes forth like the light.
28:6:6:For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.
28:6:7:But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant; they have been unfaithful to me there.
28:6:8:Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with blood.
28:6:9:As bands of robbers lie in wait for someone, so does the company of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.
28:6:10:In the house of Israel, I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's prostitution is there, and Israel is defiled.
28:6:11:Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed when I restore the fortunes of my people.
28:7:1:When I wanted to heal Israel, the corruption of Ephraim and the wickedness of Samaria were exposed, for they practice deceit; thieves break in, and bands of robbers raid outside.
28:7:2:But they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me.
28:7:3:By their wickedness they make the king rejoice, and the princes by their lies.
28:7:4:All of them are adulterers, like an oven heated by a baker who stops stirring the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
28:7:5:On the day of our king, the princes become sick with the heat of wine; he joins hands with those who mock him.
28:7:6:Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
28:7:7:All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen, but none of them call upon me.
28:7:8:Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is like a cake not turned.
28:7:9:Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not know.
28:7:10:Israel's pride testifies against him, yet they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him in spite of all this.
28:7:11:Ephraim is like a senseless dove, easily deceived and lacking discernment; they call on Egypt for help, they turn to Assyria.
28:7:12:As they go, I will spread my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will punish them for their wicked deeds.
28:7:13:Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! Though I long to redeem them, they speak lies about me.
28:7:14:They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail upon their beds. They gather together for grain and new wine but turn away from me.
28:7:15:Though I trained and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me.
28:7:16:They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow; their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this, they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
28:8:1:Listen to the sound of the trumpet, for God has a warning for his people: they have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.
28:8:2:Now Israel cries out to me, "Our God, we acknowledge you!" But because of their deceit, he will not save them.
28:8:3:They have abandoned the Lord and created kings and princes without his approval, bringing judgment upon themselves.
28:8:4:They have made idols with their silver and gold, which will soon be destroyed.
28:8:5:God rejects the calf idol of Samaria, declaring his anger against it. How long until they are purified from this sin?
28:8:6:The calf was crafted by an artisan, but it is not God. It will be shattered into pieces, for it has brought shame upon Israel.
28:8:7:Because they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind. Their crops will yield no grain, and if any does grow, it will not feed them.
28:8:8:Israel has been swallowed up by the nations; they are like a useless vessel among them.
28:8:9:They have gone to Assyria, seeking help like a wild donkey wandering alone, but Ephraim has sold itself to lovers.
28:8:10:Even though they have hired allies among the nations, I will now gather them together, and they will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king.
28:8:11:Ephraim has built many altars for sin offerings, but these have become altars for sinning.
28:8:12:I gave them my laws, but they treat them as something strange.
28:8:13:Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to me, it only brings them more guilt. They will return to Egypt, where they will eat unclean food.
28:8:14:Israel has forgotten its Maker and built palaces, while Judah has fortified many cities. But I will send fire upon their cities, and it will consume their strongholds.
28:9:1:Don't celebrate, Israel! Don't be happy like other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God, loving the wages of a prostitute on every grain-threshing floor.
28:9:2:Grain floors and winepresses will not feed the people; the new wine will fail them.
28:9:3:They won't remain in the Lord's land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.
28:9:4:They won't pour drink offerings of wine to the Lord, nor will their sacrifices please Him. Their bread will be like mourners' food; all who eat it will be defiled. For their bread is for themselves; it will not enter the house of the Lord.
28:9:5:What will you do on the day of appointed festivals, and on the day of the Lord's feast?
28:9:6:For even if they escape destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; thorns will grow in their tents.
28:9:7:The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution are here. Israel will know it. The prophet is a fool, and the spiritual man is insane because of the great iniquity and hostility.
28:9:8:Ephraim was a watchman with my God; but now the prophet has become a fowler's snare in all his ways. Hostility is in the house of his God.
28:9:9:They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.
28:9:10:I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal Peor and consecrated themselves to shame, and became as detestable as the thing they loved.
28:9:11:Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird—no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.
28:9:12:Even if they raise children, I will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when I turn away from them!
28:9:13:I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out their children to the murderer.
28:9:14:Give them, Lord—what will you give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry.
28:9:15:All their wickedness is in Gilgal; indeed, I came to hate them there. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their leaders are rebellious.
28:9:16:Ephraim is struck down—their root is dried up; they will bear no fruit. Even if they give birth, I will slay their cherished offspring.
28:9:17:My God will reject them because they have not listened to Him; they will be wanderers among the nations.
28:10:1:The people of Israel have become like a vine that has grown too much, producing fruit only for themselves. The more successful they are, the more altars they build; the richer their land, the more beautiful their sacred pillars.
28:10:2:Their hearts are divided, so they will be held responsible. God will break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars.
28:10:3:For now they say, "We have no king, because we did not fear the Lord. And what would a king do for us anyway?"
28:10:4:They make promises and swear false oaths, creating legal chaos. Therefore, justice grows like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
28:10:5:The people of Samaria tremble in fear for the calf-idol of Beth-aven. They will mourn over it, and the priests who rejoiced over it will cry out in anguish because its glory has been taken away.
28:10:6:It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced, and Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.
28:10:7:Samaria's king will vanish like foam on the surface of the water.
28:10:8:The high places of wickedness will be destroyed, the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!"
28:10:9:Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. Will not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
28:10:10:When I desire, I will discipline them, and nations will be gathered against them when they are bound for their double guilt.
28:10:11:Ephraim is like a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground.
28:10:12:Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the Lord until He comes and showers righteousness upon you.
28:10:13:But you have planted wickedness, reaped evil, and eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and your many warriors,
28:10:14:the roar of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, just as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.
28:10:15:This is what will happen to you, Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
28:11:1:When Israel was young, I loved him, and out of Egypt, I called my son.
28:11:2:As they went further, the more they strayed from me; to other gods they offered sacrifices, and to idols they bowed in worship.
28:11:3:Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they didn't recognize that I healed them.
28:11:4:With gentle cords and loving bands, I drew them close; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.
28:11:5:They will not return to Egypt, but Assyria will be their king, because they refused to repent.
28:11:6:The sword will rage against their cities, destroying their strongholds and consuming them due to their schemes.
28:11:7:My people are determined to turn away from me; though they call out to the Most High, he will not exalt them.
28:11:8:How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah or Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is stirred.
28:11:9:I will not execute my fierce anger, nor will I destroy Ephraim again. For I am God, not a mere mortal; I am the Holy One among you, and I will not come in wrath.
28:11:10:They will follow the Lord, who will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.
28:11:11:Like birds, they will come from Egypt, and like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes, declares the Lord.
28:11:12:Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and remains faithful to the Holy One.
28:12:1:In Ephraim's deceit, God has a controversy with Judah; Jacob will face the consequences of his actions and struggle.
28:12:2:Ephraim feeds on wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply lies and violence, making agreements with Assyria and sending olive oil to Egypt.
28:12:3:The Lord also brings a charge against Israel's ancestor, Jacob; He will punish him according to his ways and repay him for his deeds.
28:12:4:In the womb, Jacob took hold of his brother's heel, and in his strength, he struggled with God.
28:12:5:He wrestled with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought God's favor. At Bethel, he met God and talked with Him there.
28:12:6:So now, turn back to your God; maintain love and justice, and always put your hope in Him.
28:12:7:But as for the merchants, they use dishonest scales and love to deceive.
28:12:8:Ephraim boasts, "I have become rich; I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they won't find any guilt in me that would be sin."
28:12:9:Yet I am the Lord your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of the appointed festival.
28:12:10:I have spoken through the prophets and given them many visions; through the prophets, I have told parables.
28:12:11:Is there wickedness in Gilead? Certainly! They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal, but their altars will become heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.
28:12:12:Jacob fled to the country of Aram; Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he tended sheep.
28:12:13:By a prophet, the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet, they were preserved.
28:12:14:Ephraim has provoked God to anger most bitterly; therefore, his Lord will leave the guilt of his bloodshed upon him and repay him for his contempt.
28:13:1:In the past, when Ephraim spoke, people trembled; he was a powerful leader in Israel. But he became guilty of idolatry and died.
28:13:2:Now they continue to sin by making silver idols, crafting them with skillful hands. They say, "These are our gods who offer us protection!" They create images of calves for worship.
28:13:3:So they will vanish like morning mist, like dew that disappears at dawn, like chaff blown away from the threshing floor, or like smoke escaping through a window.
28:13:4:Yet I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt. You should know no other god but me; there is no savior besides me.
28:13:5:I took care of you in the wilderness, in the dry and barren land.
28:13:6:But when they were satisfied and well-fed, they became proud and forgot me.
28:13:7:So I will become like a lion to them, like a leopard lurking by the road.
28:13:8:I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and tear open their hearts. I will devour them like a lion, as a wild animal would rip them apart.
28:13:9:Israel, you have brought destruction upon yourself, for you have turned against me, your only help.
28:13:10:Where is your king now? Let him save you in all your cities! Where are the rulers and leaders you demanded, saying, "Give me a king and leaders"?
28:13:11:In my anger, I gave you kings, and in my wrath, I took them away.
28:13:12:Ephraim's guilt is stored up; his sin is kept on record.
28:13:13:Pain will come to Ephraim, like that of a woman in labor. But he is an unwise child who resists being born when it is time to leave the womb.
28:13:14:I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. Death, where are your plagues? Grave, where is your destruction? Repentance will be hidden from my eyes.
28:14:1:Return to the Lord, Israel, for you have stumbled in your sin.
28:14:2:Bring your confessions and turn back to the Lord; say to Him, "Forgive all our sins and accept our humble plea, so we may offer you our praise as a gift."
28:14:3:Assyria cannot save us; we will not rely on horses. We won't call our handiwork 'our gods' anymore, for it is in You that the orphan finds mercy."
28:14:4:I will heal their unfaithfulness; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.
28:14:5:I will be like dew to Israel; they will blossom like a lily, and their roots will grow deep like the cedars of Lebanon.
28:14:6:Their branches will spread out; they will be beautiful like an olive tree, and fragrant like the forests of Lebanon.
28:14:7:People will dwell in their shade again, and they will flourish like grain and blossom like the vine. Their fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
28:14:8:Ephraim, what do idols have to do with me anymore? I have heard and observed him. I am like a flourishing cypress tree; your fruitfulness comes from me.
28:14:9:Whoever is wise, let them understand these things. Whoever is discerning, let them know them. For the ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.
