26:1:1:In the thirtieth year, during the fourth month, on the fifth day, as I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.
26:1:2:On that very day, in the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile,
26:1:3:The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Babylonians by the Kebar River. There, the hand of the Lord was upon him.
26:1:4:I looked, and there before me was a stormy wind coming from the north, with a great cloud and flashes of fire, surrounded by an intense brightness. In the center of it all, there appeared to be something like gleaming metal.
26:1:5:Within this vision, I saw what resembled four living creatures, each with the appearance of a human.
26:1:6:But they each had four faces and four wings.
26:1:7:Their legs were straight, and their feet were like those of a calf, shining like polished bronze.
26:1:8:Under their wings on their four sides, they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,
26:1:9:And their wings touched one another. They moved forward without turning around.
26:1:10:As for the appearance of their faces, they each had a human face, a lion's face on the right side, an ox's face on the left, and an eagle's face.
26:1:11:Each creature had two wings spread out upward, touching the wings of the creatures next to it, and two wings covering its body.
26:1:12:They went wherever the spirit directed them to go, without turning as they moved.
26:1:13:Among the creatures was something that looked like burning coals of fire, with the appearance of torches moving back and forth. The fire was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.
26:1:14:The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.
26:1:15:As I observed the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
26:1:16:The wheels appeared to be made of sparkling beryl, and all four looked alike. Each wheel seemed to be within another wheel at right angles.
26:1:17:When the creatures moved, the wheels moved in any of the four directions the creatures faced; they did not change direction as the creatures moved.
26:1:18:Their rims were tall and awe-inspiring, and they were covered with eyes all around.
26:1:19:Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
26:1:20:Wherever the spirit wanted to go, the creatures went, and the wheels followed along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:1:21:When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:1:22:Over the heads of the living creatures was something like an expanse, shining like crystal, stretched out above them.
26:1:23:Under the expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another, with each creature having two wings covering its body.
26:1:24:As they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26:1:25:Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.
26:1:26:Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne made of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure resembling a human.
26:1:27:I saw that from what appeared to be the waist up, the figure looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and from the waist down, it looked like fire, and there was a brilliant light surrounding it.
26:1:28:Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around the figure. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard a voice speaking.
26:2:1:God said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet, and I will speak to you."
26:2:2:As He spoke, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me.
26:2:3:He told me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, a rebellious nation that has turned against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me until this very day.
26:2:4:These people are stubborn and obstinate; I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says.'
26:2:5:Whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26:2:6:And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or terrified by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
26:2:7:You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.
26:2:8:But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."
26:3:1:God said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find here. Eat this scroll, and then go speak to the people of Israel."
26:3:2:So I opened my mouth, and He gave me the scroll to eat.
26:3:3:He told me, "Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
26:3:4:Afterward, He said to me, "Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and share with them the words I have given you."
26:3:5:I was not sent to a people with a difficult language or obscure speech but to the house of Israel,
26:3:6:not to many nations with hard-to-understand languages whose words you cannot comprehend. If I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
26:3:7:But the people of Israel will not be willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to Me, for all of them are stubborn and hard-hearted.
26:3:8:Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as tough as their foreheads.
26:3:9:I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don't be afraid of them or discouraged by their looks, even though they are a rebellious people."
26:3:10:And He continued, "Son of man, listen carefully to all the words I speak to you, and take them to heart.
26:3:11:Now go to your fellow exiles, the people of Israel, and speak to them. Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says,' whether they listen or refuse to listen."
26:3:12:Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me as the glory of the Lord rose from its place.
26:3:13:I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling noise.
26:3:14:The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and anger, with the strong hand of the Lord on me.
26:3:15:I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.
26:3:16:At the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me:
26:3:17:"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the words I speak and give them warning from Me.
26:3:18:When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their lives, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26:3:19:But if you do warn the wicked and they do not turn from their wickedness or their evil ways, they will die for their sin, but you will have saved yourself.
26:3:20:Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous deeds they had done will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26:3:21:But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself."
26:3:22:The hand of the Lord was on me there, and He said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."
26:3:23:So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.
26:3:24:Then the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke to me and said, "Go, shut yourself inside your house.
26:3:25:And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.
26:3:26:I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people.
26:3:27:But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says.' Whoever listens, let them listen; and whoever refuses, let them refuse, for they are a rebellious people."
26:4:1:Now, you, human, take a clay tablet and lay it before you. Draw the city of Jerusalem on it.
26:4:2:Lay siege against this representation; build a ramp, set up camps, and place battering rams all around it.
26:4:3:Then take an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city. Turn your face toward it, and it will be under siege—you shall besiege it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
26:4:4:Next, lie on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel upon yourself. You will bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on that side.
26:4:5:I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity—390 days. Thus, you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
26:4:6:When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.
26:4:7:Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
26:4:8:See, I will bind you with cords so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.
26:4:9:Gather wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt into one container. Make bread from them for yourself, eating it according to the number of days you lie on your side—390 days.
26:4:10:Your food, which you eat, will be rationed by weight—twenty shekels a day. Eat it at set times each day.
26:4:11:Also, measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at regular intervals.
26:4:12:You will eat the bread as you would a barley cake; bake it over human excrement in their sight.
26:4:13:The Lord said, "In this way, the Israelites will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them."
26:4:14:Then I replied, "No, Lord God! I have never been defiled. From my youth until now, I have not eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth."
26:4:15:He answered me, "Very well, I will let you use cow's dung instead of human excrement, and you may cook your bread over that."
26:4:16:He then said to me, "Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat rationed food and drink rationed water.
26:4:17:They will be appalled at the sight of one another and waste away because of their iniquity."
26:5:1:You, human, take a sharp sword and use it like a barber's razor to shave your head and beard. Then weigh out the hair on a scale and divide it into three parts.
26:5:2:When the days of the siege are over, burn one-third of the hair inside the city. Take another third and strike it with the sword all around the city. Scatter the last third to the wind, and I will chase them with my drawn sword.
26:5:3:But keep a few strands of hair and tie them in the folds of your garment.
26:5:4:Take some of these hairs and throw them into the fire, burning them up. From there, a fire will spread to all the people of Israel.
26:5:5:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This is Jerusalem! I placed her at the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
26:5:6:Yet she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more wickedly than the surrounding nations. She has rejected my commands and violated my statutes.
26:5:7:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you, and you have not followed my statutes or kept my commands. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.
26:5:8:So now, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment upon you in the sight of the nations.
26:5:9:Because of all your detestable practices, I will do things to you that I have never done before and will never do again.
26:5:10:Parents will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents within your walls. I will execute judgment on you, and I will scatter any survivors to the winds.
26:5:11:Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable idols and abominations, I will cut you down. I will not look on you with pity or spare you.
26:5:12:A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; another third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and the last third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with a drawn sword.
26:5:13:Then my anger will be spent, and I will vent my fury on them and satisfy myself. And they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in my zeal when I have spent my wrath upon them.
26:5:14:Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of scorn among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
26:5:15:You will become a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger, wrath, and furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken.
26:5:16:When I shoot at you with my deadly arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food.
26:5:17:I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, the Lord, have spoken.
26:6:1:The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:6:2:"Son of man, face the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.
26:6:3:Tell them, 'Mountains of Israel, hear the message of the Lord God: I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand to destroy your high places.
26:6:4:Your altars will be demolished, and your incense altars will be broken down. I will make your people fall dead in front of their idols.
26:6:5:I will scatter the bones of the Israelites around their altars.
26:6:6:In all the places where you live, cities will become ruins, and the high places will be devastated. Your altars will be destroyed and left in ruins; your idols will be smashed and wiped away; your incense altars will be cut down, and everything you have made will be obliterated.
26:6:7:The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the Lord.
26:6:8:But I will spare some of you, leaving a remnant who will escape the sword when you are scattered among the nations and throughout the lands.
26:6:9:Those who survive will remember me and how I was grieved by their unfaithful hearts, which turned away from me, and by their eyes that lusted after idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices.
26:6:10:And they will know that I am the Lord; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity upon them.
26:6:11:This is what the Lord God says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and cry out in anguish because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine, and plague.
26:6:12:Those far away will die of the plague, those nearby will fall by the sword, and those who remain and are besieged will die of famine. I will carry out my wrath upon them.
26:6:13:Then you will know that I am the Lord when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree, and under every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
26:6:14:I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
26:7:1:The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:7:2:"Son of man, this is what the Lord God says about the land of Israel: The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
26:7:3:Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger against you. I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you.
26:7:4:My eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations remain among you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:7:5:This is what the Lord God says: Disaster after disaster is coming!
26:7:6:The end has come! The end has arrived! It has awakened against you. Look, it is here!
26:7:7:Doom has come upon you, inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day of trouble is near, and not the joyful shouting on the mountains.
26:7:8:Soon I will pour out my wrath upon you and fulfill my anger against you. I will judge you according to your ways and repay you for all your abominations.
26:7:9:My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that it is I, the Lord, who strikes.
26:7:10:Look, the day is here! Doom has come! The rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed!
26:7:11:Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their wealth, nor anything of value.
26:7:12:The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all their multitude.
26:7:13:For the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live; for the vision concerning the whole multitude will not be reversed. No one will strengthen himself by relying on his life because of his iniquity.
26:7:14:They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
26:7:15:Outside is the sword; inside are plague and famine. Those in the field will die by the sword, while those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
26:7:16:Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each over his own iniquity.
26:7:17:All hands will go limp, and every knee will become as weak as water.
26:7:18:They will put on sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on every face, and baldness on all their heads.
26:7:19:They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be treated as unclean. Their silver and gold cannot save them in the day of the Lord's wrath. They will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it, for it has caused them to stumble into iniquity.
26:7:20:They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and used it to make detestable idols and vile images. Therefore, I will make it unclean for them.
26:7:21:I will hand it over to foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will defile it.
26:7:22:I will turn my face from them, and they will defile my treasured place. Robbers will enter it and desecrate it.
26:7:23:Forge the chains! For the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
26:7:24:So I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.
26:7:25:When terror comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.
26:7:26:Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will follow rumor. They will seek a vision from the prophet; but instruction will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
26:7:27:The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards, I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
26:8:1:One day, when I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were with me, the Lord God's hand fell upon me there.
26:8:2:I looked up and saw a figure that resembled a man. From his waist down, he appeared to be made of fire, and from his waist up, he seemed to be made of shining metal.
26:8:3:He stretched out what looked like a hand and grabbed me by the hair. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and in visions from God, He took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate facing north, where the idol that provokes jealousy stood.
26:8:4:There I saw the glory of the God of Israel, just as I had seen it in the vision on the plain.
26:8:5:Then the Lord said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and there, near the altar gate at the entrance, was the idol that caused jealousy.
26:8:6:He continued, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? The great abominations the people of Israel are committing here drive me far away from my sanctuary. But you will see even more detestable things."
26:8:7:Then He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and I saw a hole in the wall.
26:8:8:He told me, "Son of man, dig into the wall." So I dug into the wall and found a doorway.
26:8:9:He said, "Go in and see the wicked, detestable things they are doing here."
26:8:10:So I went in and looked, and I saw all sorts of crawling creatures and loathsome beasts, along with all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the walls around.
26:8:11:Before them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan in the center. Each one had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
26:8:12:Then He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in the room of his own idol? They say, 'The Lord doesn't see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.'"
26:8:13:He also said, "You will see even greater abominations that they are committing."
26:8:14:Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Lord's house, and I saw women sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.
26:8:15:He asked me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see even more detestable things than these."
26:8:16:Finally, He brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. Their backs were toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces were toward the east as they bowed down, worshiping the sun.
26:8:17:He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to commit the abominations they are practicing here? They have filled the land with violence and provoked me to anger again and again. See, they are putting the branch to their nose!
26:8:18:Because of this, I will respond with fury. I will not spare them or show pity. Even if they cry out to me, I will not listen."
26:9:1:Then I heard God calling out loudly, "Come near, you guardians of the city who have punishment in your hands, and bring destruction!"
26:9:2:And suddenly, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each had a deadly weapon in his hand. Among them was a man clothed in linen, carrying a writer's inkhorn at his side. They all went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
26:9:3:Now the glory of the God of Israel had risen from above the cherubim, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man clothed in linen with the writer's inkhorn at his side.
26:9:4:God said to him, "Go through the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things being done within it."
26:9:5:To the others, he said in my hearing, "Follow him through the city and strike down those without the mark. Show no mercy or compassion.
26:9:6:Slaughter the old and young, the maidens, women, and children; but do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin at my sanctuary." So they started with the elders who were in front of the temple.
26:9:7:He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill its courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
26:9:8:While they were carrying out their orders, I was left alone. I fell facedown and cried out, "Alas, Sovereign Lord! Are you going to destroy everyone remaining in Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"
26:9:9:He replied, "The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of injustice. They say, 'The Lord has forsaken the land; he does not see.'
26:9:10:So I will not spare them or show mercy. I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads."
26:9:11:Then the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his side reported back, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."
26:10:1:In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, I was among the captives by the river Chebar when the heavens opened up and I saw visions of God.
26:10:2:On that day, the fifth of the month, in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity,
26:10:3:The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was upon him there.
26:10:4:I looked and saw a stormy wind coming from the north, with a great cloud and fire flashing continually, and a brightness around it. In the center, there appeared to be something like glowing metal.
26:10:5:From within this, I saw what looked like four living creatures. Their appearance was like human beings,
26:10:6:But each had four faces and four wings.
26:10:7:Their legs were straight, and their feet resembled those of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze.
26:10:8:Under their wings on all four sides, they had human hands. All four creatures had faces and wings,
26:10:9:And their wings touched one another. They did not turn as they moved; each went straight ahead.
26:10:10:As for the appearance of their faces, they had the face of a human, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle.
26:10:11:Their wings were spread out upward, with two wings touching each other, and two covering their bodies.
26:10:12:Each creature moved straight ahead, going wherever the spirit directed them, without turning as they went.
26:10:13:The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or torches, with fire moving back and forth among them. The fire was bright, and lightning flashed from it.
26:10:14:The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.
26:10:15:As I observed the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
26:10:16:The wheels appeared to be made of beryl, and all four looked alike. Each wheel seemed to be within another wheel, intersecting at right angles.
26:10:17:When the creatures moved, the wheels moved alongside them; when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
26:10:18:Wherever the spirit wanted to go, the creatures went, and the wheels followed, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:10:19:When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26:10:20:Over the heads of the living creatures was an expanse, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.
26:10:21:Under the expanse, their wings stretched out straight, one toward another, with each creature having two wings covering its body.
26:10:22:The sound of their wings was like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26:10:23:Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with their wings lowered.
26:10:24:Above the expanse over their heads was something resembling a throne, with the appearance of sapphire. High above on the throne was a figure like that of a human.
26:10:25:I saw an amber glow surrounding the figure on the throne, like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. This was the radiant appearance of the glory of the Lord.
26:11:1:In the Spirit, the Lord lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the temple that faces eastward. There at the entrance, I saw twenty-five men.
26:11:2:Among them were Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
26:11:3:The Lord said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who plan evil and give wicked advice in this city.
26:11:4:They say, 'The time is not near to build houses; the city is the pot, and we are the meat.'
26:11:5:So prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!"
26:11:6:Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and told me what to say: "This is what the Lord says: You have said such things, O house of Israel, and I know what you think.
26:11:7:You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with the dead.
26:11:8:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will remove you from it.
26:11:9:I will bring you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners, and I will execute judgments upon you.
26:11:10:You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:11:11:This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
26:11:12:and you will know that I am the Lord, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not kept. Instead, you have acted according to the customs of the nations around you."
26:11:13:While I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, "Alas, Sovereign Lord! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"
26:11:14:The word of the Lord came to me:
26:11:15:"Son of man, your brothers—your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel—are those about whom the people of Jerusalem have said, 'They are far away from the Lord; this land has been given to us as our possession.'
26:11:16:Therefore say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the lands where they have gone.'
26:11:17:Thus says the Lord God, 'I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel.'
26:11:18:When they return there, they will remove all its vile images and detestable idols.
26:11:19:I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh,
26:11:20:so that they may follow my decrees and keep my laws and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
26:11:21:But as for those whose hearts pursue their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:11:22:Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26:11:23:The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.
26:11:24:The Spirit lifted me up and brought me back to the exiles in Babylonia, in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,
26:11:25:and I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.
26:12:1:God said to me, "Son of man, you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes but don't see, and ears but don't hear, for they are a rebellious lot.
26:12:2:So, human, pack your bags as if you're going into exile, and leave during the day when they can see you. You will go from your place to another place while they watch, so they might understand, though they are a rebellious people.
26:12:3:During daylight hours, bring out your baggage as if you were going into exile. In the evening, dig through the wall with your hands, and carry your belongings out through it.
26:12:4:As they watch, put your baggage on your shoulder and leave in the dark. Cover your face so you can't see the ground, because I've made you a sign for the people of Israel."
26:12:5:I did as I was commanded. During the day, I brought out my baggage like an exile's belongings. In the evening, I dug through the wall with my hands, and at night, I carried my things out, shouldering them as they watched.
26:12:6:In the morning, God's word came to me, saying:
26:12:7:"Human, didn't those rebels, the Israelites, ask you what you were doing?
26:12:8:Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: This message concerns the ruler in Jerusalem and all the people living there.' 
26:12:9:Explain that you are a symbol. Just as you've done, the ruler and his people will be taken into exile, carrying their belongings on their shoulders at night, escaping through a hole in the wall.
26:12:10:Their ruler will cover his face, so he won't see the land with his own eyes.
26:12:11:I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my trap. I'll take him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he won't see it, and there he will die.
26:12:12:Those around him, including his helpers and troops, will be scattered to the winds, and I'll draw my sword against them.
26:12:13:They will know that I am the Lord when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.
26:12:14:But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague, so they can confess their sins and those of their ancestors among the nations where they are taken captive. They will realize that they have been rebellious against me.
26:12:15:When I've broken their unfaithful hearts and brought them to repentance for their detestable practices, they will know that I am the Lord. They will understand that I did not do this without reason."
26:12:16:God's word came to me again, saying:
26:12:17:"Human, you will eat your food with trembling and drink your water with fear and anxiety.
26:12:18:Then tell the people, 'This is what the Lord God says to those living in Jerusalem and the land of Israel: They will eat their food with anxiety and drink their water in horror because their land will be stripped of everything due to the violence of those who live there.
26:12:19:The inhabited cities will be ruined, and the land will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.'"
26:12:20:Another message from God came to me:
26:12:21:"Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel, saying, 'The days go by, and every vision comes to nothing'?
26:12:22:Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: I will put an end to this proverb. They will no longer use it in Israel.' Instead, tell them, 'The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled.
26:12:23:There will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel.
26:12:24:Because I, the Lord, will speak, and whatever I say will happen. It won't be delayed any longer. In your days, rebellious people, I will fulfill every word I speak, declares the Lord God.'"
26:12:25:God's word came to me again, saying:
26:12:26:"Human, the people of Israel are saying, 'The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about times far off.'
26:12:27:Therefore, tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: None of my words will be delayed any longer. Whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God.'"
26:13:1:The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:13:2:"Human, prophesy against the false prophets of Israel who are deceiving my people. Tell them they will be punished for their lies.
26:13:3:They say, 'The Lord declares,' when I have not spoken to them. They make up visions and spread false prophecies.
26:13:4:Israel's false prophets are like a wall of whitewash that will crumble and fall.
26:13:5:I will pour out my wrath on these prophets and destroy their wall of lies. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:13:6:Their visions are false, and their predictions are deceitful. They claim to speak for me, but I have not sent them.
26:13:7:They see false visions and predict lies, yet they claim, 'The Lord declares.' How can they continue to deceive my people?
26:13:8:Because of their lies, I am against them. I, the Lord God, declare it.
26:13:9:I will stretch out my hand against these false prophets and cut them off from my people. They will no longer be remembered among the people of Israel.
26:13:10:They have misled my people by promising peace when there is no peace. They build a weak wall and cover it with whitewash.
26:13:11:Tell those who cover the weak wall with whitewash that it will fall. When my anger is unleashed, the wall and those who covered it will be destroyed.
26:13:12:Then people will ask, 'What happened to the wall and those who covered it with whitewash?'
26:13:13:This is what the Lord God says: I will unleash my fury and destroy both the wall and those who covered it with whitewash.
26:13:14:I will tear down the wall they built, exposing its weak foundation. It will collapse, and they will be destroyed in its ruins. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:13:15:In my anger, I will finish off the false prophets who deceive Israel. They will not escape my judgment or find refuge among my people. You will know that I am the Lord.
26:13:16:Human, prophesy against the women who weave magic charms and cast spells over my people. Tell them they will be punished for their wickedness.
26:13:17:I am against these women who use magic to control others. I will free my people from their power and put an end to their evil practices.
26:13:18:These women cause heartache and suffering by casting spells on innocent people. They support the wicked and turn people away from doing what is right.
26:13:19:For a handful of barley and scraps of bread, they bring shame upon my people with their lies. They kill those who should live and let live those who deserve death.
26:13:20:This is what the Lord God says: I am against your magic charms and spells. I will tear them from your arms and set my people free from your control.
26:13:21:I will also break your magic wands and save my people from your wickedness. You will know that I am the Lord.
26:13:22:You have discouraged the righteous with your lies, even when they did nothing wrong. You have encouraged the wicked not to change their ways and seek life.
26:13:23:Because of this, you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will rescue my people from your grasp, and you will know that I am the Lord."
26:14:1:One day, some of Israel's elders came to me and sat down in front of me.
26:14:2:Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:14:3:"Son of man, these elders have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them consult me at all?
26:14:4:So speak to them and tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his idols.
26:14:5:I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.'
26:14:6:Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Repent! Turn away from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!
26:14:7:When any Israelite or foreigner living among you separates himself from me, setting up idols in his heart and putting a wicked stumbling block before his face, then comes to a prophet to inquire of me, I the Lord will answer him myself.
26:14:8:I will set my face against that person and make him an example and a warning. I will remove him from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:14:9:And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, it was I, the Lord, who deceived that prophet. I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel.
26:14:10:They will bear their guilt—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him.
26:14:11:This is so the people of Israel will no longer stray from me and no longer defile themselves with all their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign Lord.'"
26:14:12:The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,
26:14:13:"Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful, and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals,
26:14:14:Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:14:15:Or if I were to send wild beasts through that country and they left it childless and it became desolate so that no one could pass through it because of the beasts,
26:14:16:As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.
26:14:17:Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, 'Let the sword pass throughout the land,' and I kill its people and their animals,
26:14:18:As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.
26:14:19:Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals,
26:14:20:As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved by their righteousness.
26:14:21:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: How much worse will it be when I send my four dreadful judgments—sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—to that country to cut off from it both people and animals!
26:14:22:Yet, there will be some survivors—sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem—all that I have brought upon it.
26:14:23:They will console you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in vain in it, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:15:1:God asked me, "What is the use of a vine tree among all the trees in the forest?"
26:15:2:"If you take its wood to make something useful, like a peg to hang things on,
26:15:3:how much less useful is it when it's just a vine branch that has been set on fire and burned?
26:15:4:After it's charred and useless, can you still make anything out of it?
26:15:5:In its original state, it wasn't suitable for any work. How much more so after the fire has consumed it and left it scorched?
26:15:6:So this is what the Lord God says: Just as I have given up on the vine tree among the trees in the forest, which I've handed over to the fire for fuel, so will I deal with the people living in Jerusalem.
26:15:7:I will turn against them, and even though they may escape from the fire, the fire will still consume them. You will know that I am the Lord when I turn against them.
26:15:8:And I will make their land desolate because they have been unfaithful," declares the Lord God.
26:16:1:Once upon a time, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:16:2:"Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices.
26:16:3:Tell her, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You were born in Canaan, and your parents were Hittite and Amorite.
26:16:4:When you were born, no one cut your umbilical cord, washed you with water, or rubbed you with salt.
26:16:5:No one wrapped you in cloth or showed you any compassion; you were left out in the open field, despised on the day of your birth.
26:16:6:"But I passed by and saw you squirming in your blood. I told you, 'Live!' while you were covered in blood.
26:16:7:I made you grow like a plant in the field, and you developed into a beautiful young woman. Your breasts formed, your hair grew long, but you were still naked and exposed.
26:16:8:"Later, I passed by again and saw that you were old enough for love. So I spread my cloak over you to cover your nakedness and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign Lord. You became mine.
26:16:9:"Then I bathed you with water, washed away your blood, and anointed you with oil.
26:16:10:I dressed you in embroidered garments, gave you fine leather sandals, wrapped you in fine linen, and covered you with silk.
26:16:11:I adorned you with jewelry, putting bracelets on your wrists and a necklace around your neck.
26:16:12:I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
26:16:13:So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was made of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate the finest foods—flour, honey, and olive oil—and became incredibly beautiful, fit for royalty.
26:16:14:"Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, which I had perfected through my splendor that I bestowed upon you, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:16:15:"But you trusted in your beauty and used it to become a prostitute. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and your beauty was theirs for the taking.
26:16:16:You took some of your garments and made colorful high places for yourself, where you prostituted yourself to anyone who came along. Such things should not have happened, nor should they ever occur.
26:16:17:"You also took the beautiful jewelry I gave you, made from the gold and silver, and crafted idols for yourself, engaging in prostitution with them.
26:16:18:You took your embroidered clothes to cover these idols and placed my oil and incense before them.
26:16:19:My food that I provided for you—the flour, oil, and honey that you ate—you set before them as a pleasing aroma. This is what happened, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:16:20:"Moreover, you took your sons and daughters, whom you bore to me, and sacrificed them as food for the idols. Wasn't your prostitution enough?
26:16:21:You slaughtered my children and offered them up to idols by burning them alive.
26:16:22:"In all your detestable practices and prostitution, you never remembered the days of your youth when you were naked and exposed, squirming in your blood.
26:16:23:"After all this wickedness, woe to you! declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:16:24:You built yourself a mound and made yourself a lofty place in every public square.
26:16:25:At every street corner, you built your lofty places and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs for every passerby, multiplying your acts of prostitution.
26:16:26:"You also engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and allowed them to satisfy their desires with you, further provoking me to anger.
26:16:27:So I stretched out my hand against you, reduced your territory, and handed you over to the mercy of your enemies, the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct.
26:16:28:"You also prostituted yourself with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied. Even after that, you were still not satisfied.
26:16:29:So you increased your promiscuity, going to Babylonia, the land of merchants, but even with them, you were not satisfied.
26:16:30:"How weak-willed you are, declares the Sovereign Lord, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute!
26:16:31:When you build your mounds at every street corner and make your lofty places in every public square, you are not like a prostitute because you scorn payment.
26:16:32:"You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers over your own husband.
26:16:33:All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors.
26:16:34:In your prostitution, you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for favors. Since you give payment instead of receiving it, you're different.
26:16:35:"Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the Lord!
26:16:36:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you have poured out your lust and exposed yourself in prostitution with all your lovers, and because of all the detestable idols you have worshiped, and because you have given the blood of your children to them,
26:16:37:I will surely gather all your lovers, those you pleased and those you loved, as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and expose your nakedness to them so they can see all your nakedness.
26:16:38:I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger.
26:16:39:Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry, leaving you naked and exposed.
26:16:40:They will also bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords.
26:16:41:They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put an end to your prostitution, and you will never again pay your lovers.
26:16:42:Then my wrath against you will subside, and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
26:16:43:"Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring your conduct down upon your own head, declares the Sovereign Lord. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices?
26:16:44:Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'
26:16:45:You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26:16:46:Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom.
26:16:47:Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their detestable practices; as if that were too little, you quickly became more corrupt than they in all your ways.
26:16:48:As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done.
26:16:49:Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.
26:16:50:They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore, I removed them when I saw it.
26:16:51:Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done.
26:16:52:Now then, bear your disgrace, for you have brought justification to your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
26:16:53:"I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and those of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes along with them,
26:16:54:so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort.
26:16:55:And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before.
26:16:56:Your sister Sodom was never mentioned by you in the day of your pride,
26:16:57:before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you.
26:16:58:You have brought this on yourself by your lewdness and detestable practices, declares the Lord.
26:16:59:"For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant.
26:16:60:Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
26:16:61:Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you.
26:16:62:I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord,
26:16:63:so that when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:17:1:One day, the Lord spoke to me in a riddle about two eagles and a vine.
26:17:2:The first eagle had long wings and many feathers, and it took a seedling from Lebanon, planting it in a fertile field beside abundant waters.
26:17:3:In that place, the young plant grew into a low, spreading vine with branches turning toward the eagle, and its roots stayed deep in the soil where it was planted.
26:17:4:Then another eagle appeared, also with long wings and many feathers, and the vine reached out its roots and branches toward this second eagle, hoping for more water.
26:17:5:But the vine was already planted in fertile soil near abundant waters, so it could grow into a strong tree with thick branches and produce bountiful fruit.
26:17:6:However, the vine's ambition led it to seek help from the second eagle, even though it was already in a perfect place to thrive.
26:17:7:Now, the Lord asked me, "Will the vine succeed in reaching the second eagle? Will it uproot itself and risk losing its fruitful life?"
26:17:8:The Lord declared, "I have placed the vine in a fertile land with plenty of water, but if it insists on seeking the second eagle, I will tear it out by its roots and let it wither away."
26:17:9:When the vine is uprooted, its leaves will dry up, and no one will be able to save it. It will wither and die, whether in the care of the first or second eagle.
26:17:10:So I, Ezekiel, relayed the Lord's message to the people of Israel, telling them the meaning of the riddle.
26:17:11:The first eagle represented the king of Babylon, who had taken Israel's king and nobles captive.
26:17:12:The seedling was a member of the royal family, whom the king of Babylon had placed on the throne in Jerusalem. But this new king rebelled against Babylon, seeking help from the second eagle, Egypt.
26:17:13:God said that the king's rebellion would not succeed, and he would be punished for breaking his covenant with Babylon.
26:17:14:In the end, the Lord declared that only when He Himself intervened, raising up a righteous king from David's line, would Israel finally flourish and find peace.
26:18:1:The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:18:2:"Why do you quote this proverb among the people of Israel: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?'
26:18:3:I, the Lord God, declare that this proverb will no longer be used in Israel.
26:18:4:Behold, all souls belong to Me; both the father's soul and the son's soul are Mine. The one who sins is the one who will die.
26:18:5:Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right.
26:18:6:He doesn't eat at the mountain shrines or lift his eyes to the idols of Israel. He doesn't defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her period.
26:18:7:He doesn't oppress anyone but returns what he took as collateral for a loan. He feeds the hungry and clothes the naked.
26:18:8:He doesn't lend at interest or take profit. He refrains from injustice and judges fairly between people.
26:18:9:He follows My decrees and faithfully keeps My laws. That man is truly righteous; he will surely live, declares the Lord God.
26:18:10:But if he has a son who is violent, sheds blood, and does any of these things,
26:18:11:even though the father has done none of them - the son eats at the mountain shrines, defiles his neighbor's wife,
26:18:12:oppresses the poor and needy, steals, doesn't return collateral, worships idols, and commits abominations,
26:18:13:lends at interest and takes profit - will this son live? No, he will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely die; his blood will be on his own head.
26:18:14:But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits and, though he sees them, doesn't do such things:
26:18:15:He doesn't eat at the mountain shrines, worship idols, or defile his neighbor's wife.
26:18:16:He doesn't oppress anyone, doesn't take collateral, doesn't steal, feeds the hungry, and clothes the naked.
26:18:17:He refrains from oppressing the poor, doesn't lend at interest or take profit, obeys My laws, and follows My decrees. He won't die for his father's sins; he will surely live.
26:18:18:As for the father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what was not good among his people, he will die for his sin.
26:18:19:You ask, 'Why doesn't the son bear the guilt of the father?' Because the son has done what is just and right, kept My laws and followed them, he will surely live.
26:18:20:The one who sins is the one who will die. The child won't bear the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent bear the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.
26:18:21:But if the wicked turn away from their sins, obey My laws, and do what is just and right, they will surely live and not die.
26:18:22:None of the offenses they committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.
26:18:23:Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Lord God. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
26:18:24:But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, doing the same detestable things the wicked do, will they live? None of the righteous acts they did will be remembered. Because of their unfaithfulness and the sins they committed, they will die.
26:18:25:Yet you say, 'The Lord's way is not fair.' Hear me, people of Israel: Is My way unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26:18:26:When a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they committed, they will die.
26:18:27:But if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right, they will save their life.
26:18:28:Because they considered and turned away from all the offenses they committed, they will surely live and not die.
26:18:29:Yet the people of Israel say, 'The Lord's way is not fair.' Are My ways unfair, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unfair?
26:18:30:Therefore, I will judge each of you according to your actions, declares the Lord God. Repent and turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.
26:18:31:Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel?
26:18:32:For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord God. So repent and live!
26:19:1:Listen to this lament, you leaders of Israel!
26:19:2:Your mother was like a lioness among lions; she lay down among the young lions and raised her cubs.
26:19:3:She brought up one of her cubs, who became a strong lion; he learned to tear apart his prey, and he devoured people.
26:19:4:Nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit; they led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26:19:5:When she saw that her hope was gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.
26:19:6:He prowled among the lions, becoming a powerful lion; he learned to tear apart his prey, devouring people.
26:19:7:He destroyed their fortresses and laid waste to their cities; the land and its inhabitants trembled at the sound of his roar.
26:19:8:Then the nations came against him from every direction; they spread their net over him, and he was trapped in their pit.
26:19:9:With hooks, they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon; they imprisoned him in a fortress so his roar would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26:19:10:Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of the abundant water.
26:19:11:Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter; it towered high above the thick foliage, visible from afar because of its height and the abundance of its branches.
26:19:12:But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground; the east wind dried up its fruit, and its strong branches were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.
26:19:13:Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.
26:19:14:Fire has spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit; no strong branch remains to be a ruler's scepter. This is a lament and will be used as a lament.
26:20:1:On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile, the word of the Lord came to me.
26:20:2:"Son of man," He said, "set your face toward Jerusalem and speak against the sanctuaries; prophesy against the land of Israel.
26:20:3:Tell them, 'This is what the Lord says: I am against you, Israel, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
26:20:4:Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
26:20:5:In that day, your people who live among the nations will know that I, the Lord, have executed judgment on Israel.'"
26:20:6:Moreover, tell the house of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God says: It is not for your sake that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
26:20:7:I will show the holiness of My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Sovereign Lord, when I show Myself holy through you before their eyes.
26:20:8:For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
26:20:9:I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
26:20:10:I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26:20:11:And I will put My Spirit in you and move you to follow My decrees and be careful to keep My laws.
26:20:12:Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be My people, and I will be your God.
26:20:13:I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you.
26:20:14:I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine.
26:20:15:Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.
26:20:16:I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign Lord. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!
26:20:17:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt.
26:20:18:The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it.
26:20:19:They will say, "This land that was laid waste has become like the Garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited."
26:20:20:Then the nations around you that remain will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.'
26:20:21:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Once again I will yield to Israel's plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep,
26:20:22:as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals. So will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
26:21:1:The word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:21:2:"Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel.
26:21:3:Tell them, 'This is what the Lord says: I am against you, and I will draw my sword from its sheath. I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you.
26:21:4:Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
26:21:5:Then all people will know that I, the Lord, have drawn my sword from its sheath, and it will not return until its work is done.'
26:21:6:So now, son of man, groan! Groan bitterly before their eyes.
26:21:7:When they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' say, 'Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear, and every hand will become weak. Everyone's spirit will be faint, and every knee will become as weak as water.' Yes, it is coming, and it will surely happen, declares the Lord God."
26:21:8:Again, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:21:9:"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord says: Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.
26:21:10:It is sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? The sword despises every such stick.
26:21:11:He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened and polished, ready for the hand of the slayer.'
26:21:12:Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore, strike your thigh.
26:21:13:For this testing will surely come. And what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Lord God."
26:21:14:So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is a sword for slaughter, a sword for great slaughter, closing in on them from every side.
26:21:15:So that hearts may melt with fear and the fallen be many, I have stationed the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Oh! It is made to flash like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter.
26:21:16:Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your blade is directed.
26:21:17:I too will strike my hands together, and I will satisfy my wrath. I, the Lord, have spoken."
26:21:18:The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,
26:21:19:"Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city.
26:21:20:Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.
26:21:21:For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: he shakes the arrows, consults his idols, and examines the liver.
26:21:22:Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect siege works.
26:21:23:It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him, but he will remind them of their guilt, that they may be captured.
26:21:24:Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Because you have brought your guilt to remembrance, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that your sins appear in all your deeds, because you have come to remember, you will be taken captive.'
26:21:25:You profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of final punishment is here,
26:21:26:This is what the Lord God says: 'Remove the turban, take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt the lowly and bring low the exalted.
26:21:27:A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin! This also shall not be until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.'
26:21:28:And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord God says concerning the Ammonites and their reproach. Say, A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for the slaughter, to consume and to flash like lightning.
26:21:29:While they see false visions for you and perform lying divinations, I will place you over the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, whose time of final punishment is here.
26:21:30:Return the sword to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
26:21:31:I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skilled in destruction.
26:21:32:You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be shed in the land; you will be remembered no more, for I, the Lord, have spoken.'"
26:22:1:This is what the Lord says: "There's a city drenched in blood, and its time has come. I will make it a pile of ruins.
26:22:2:Now, you, son of man, will you judge this bloody city? Make her aware of all her detestable practices.
26:22:3:Tell her, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You are a city that sheds blood within your walls, bringing your judgment day closer. You've made idols to defile yourself.
26:22:4:You're guilty because of the blood you've shed, and you're defiled by the idols you've made. You've brought your days to an end; your appointed time has come. That's why I've made you an object of scorn for the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.
26:22:5:Those near and far will mock you, infamous city full of turmoil.
26:22:6:See how every leader in Israel within you has used their power to shed blood.
26:22:7:They've treated father and mother with contempt, oppressed foreigners, mistreated orphans and widows.
26:22:8:You've despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths.
26:22:9:Slanderers are among you, seeking to kill. You eat at the mountain shrines and commit wicked acts.
26:22:10:Incestuous acts occur within you; men defile their father's wives. They force themselves on women during their menstrual impurity.
26:22:11:One commits an abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law. And yet another violates his sister, his own father's daughter.
26:22:12:People in you accept bribes to shed blood. You take interest and profit, extorting your neighbors. And you've forgotten me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:22:13:Now I'll strike my hands together because of your dishonest gain and the bloodshed within you.
26:22:14:Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day when I deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will act.
26:22:15:I'll scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries; I will put an end to your uncleanness.
26:22:16:When you're defiled in the sight of the nations, you'll know that I am the Lord."
26:22:17:Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26:22:18:"Son of man, the people of Israel have become like dross to me; they're all like copper, tin, iron, and lead left inside a furnace. They're like the worthless remains of silver.
26:22:19:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: 'Because you've all become dross, I'm about to gather you into Jerusalem.
26:22:20:As silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and wrath, putting you in and melting you down.
26:22:21:I'll gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you'll be melted inside her.
26:22:22:As silver melts in a furnace, so you'll be melted inside her, and you'll know that I, the Lord, have poured out my wrath on you.'"
26:22:23:The word of the Lord came to me:
26:22:24:"Son of man, say to her: 'You're a land that hasn't been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.
26:22:25:There's a conspiracy among her prophets; they're like roaring lions tearing their prey. They devour people, seize treasures and precious things, and leave many widows among them.
26:22:26:Her priests violate my law and profane my holy things. They don't distinguish between the holy and the common; they don't teach the difference between the unclean and the clean. They disregard my Sabbaths so that I am dishonored among them.
26:22:27:Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives for dishonest gain.
26:22:28:Her prophets whitewash these deeds by false visions and lying divinations, saying, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says'—when the Lord hasn't spoken.
26:22:29:The people of the land practice extortion, commit robbery, and oppress the poor and needy. They mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.
26:22:30:I searched for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land, so I wouldn't have to destroy it, but I found no one.
26:22:31:So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they've done, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:23:1:Two women, sisters, were the daughters of one mother. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. Their names were Oholah and Oholibah.
26:23:2:Oholah, the older sister, lived in Samaria and represented Israel, while her younger sister Oholibah, who lived in Jerusalem, represented Judah.
26:23:3:They offered themselves to their lovers, the Egyptians, with lustful passion, and they continued their immoral behavior even after becoming mine.
26:23:4:Their adulterous acts began in Egypt, where they lost their virginity. There, men fondled their breasts and aroused their youthful desires.
26:23:5:Despite being mine, Oholah continued her prostitution with her Egyptian lovers, who were obsessed with her sensual beauty.
26:23:6:She gave herself to them, the leaders and officials of Egypt, all of whom were handsome and well-endowed.
26:23:7:Her sexual immorality grew worse as she pursued her lustful desires with the Egyptians, who slept with her time and time again, defiling her.
26:23:8:She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, where men had slept with her during her youth, fondled her breasts, and used her for their pleasure.
26:23:9:So I handed her over to her lovers, the very Egyptians she desired so much.
26:23:10:They exposed her nakedness, took away her children, and put her to death.
26:23:11:When her sister Oholibah saw this, she became even more depraved than Oholah and surpassed her in prostitution.
26:23:12:She too lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors dressed in splendor, horsemen riding on steeds, all of them desirable young men.
26:23:13:I saw that she too had defiled herself; both sisters went down the same path.
26:23:14:But Oholibah's immorality increased even more. She saw images of Babylonian men carved on a wall, wearing red and adorned with belts and flowing turbans.
26:23:15:She was drawn to their appearance, and she sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26:23:16:When the Babylonians came to her, they slept with her and defiled her with their lust. After being defiled by them, she turned away in disgust.
26:23:17:But she continued her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt.
26:23:18:She lusted after their lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emissions were like those of horses.
26:23:19:Oholibah, you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your breasts and aroused your youthful desires.
26:23:20:Therefore, I will bring your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust. I will gather them from all around, the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, along with all the Assyrians.
26:23:21:They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, forming a large army. They will set themselves against you on every side, armed with shields, helmets, and swords.
26:23:22:I will hand you over to them for punishment, and they will judge you according to their own standards.
26:23:23:They will take away your wealth, strip you of your clothes, and leave you naked and bare. Your children will be taken from you, and you will be put to death.
26:23:24:They will burn your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put an end to your prostitution, and you will never again pay your lovers.
26:23:25:I am filled with jealousy, and my anger will be poured out on you. I will take vengeance on you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your nose and ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword.
26:23:26:They will seize your sons and daughters, and those who remain will be consumed by fire.
26:23:27:I will put an end to your lewdness and your prostitution, which began in Egypt. You will not look back at them or remember Egypt anymore.
26:23:28:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.
26:23:29:They will treat you with hatred, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and exposed. Your shame will be revealed, and your sinful acts will be exposed.
26:23:30:You brought this on yourself by prostituting yourself to other nations and defiling yourself with their idols.
26:23:31:You followed in your sister's footsteps, so I will put her cup of punishment into your hand.
26:23:32:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You will drink your sister's cup, a deep and wide one, filled with horror and desolation. You will be mocked and scorned, for it holds so much.
26:23:33:You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
26:23:34:You will drink it and drain it dry, then chew on its broken pieces and tear at your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:23:35:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.
26:23:36:The Lord said to me, "Son of man, confront Oholah and Oholibah, and declare their abominations to them.
26:23:37:They have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and they have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for their idols.
26:23:38:They have also done this to me: they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my Sabbaths.
26:23:39:On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.
26:23:40:They even sent for men from far away, inviting them with a messenger. And when they arrived, you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and put on your jewelry.
26:23:41:You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it, on which you had placed my incense and my oil.
26:23:42:The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, who put bracelets on the wrists of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26:23:43:Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.'
26:23:44:And they slept with her as men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, those lewd women.
26:23:45:But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.
26:23:46:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.
26:23:47:The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.
26:23:48:Thus, I will put an end to lewdness in the land, so that all women may take warning and not imitate you.
26:23:49:You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins with idols. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord."
26:24:1:On the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
26:24:2:"Son of man, write down today's date, this very day, because on this day the king of Babylon has begun his siege against Jerusalem.
26:24:3:Now tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: Put on the cooking pot, fill it with water,
26:24:4:add pieces of meat to it, choice cuts from the best parts, taken from the finest of the flock.
26:24:5:Pile wood under it for burning, cook the meat well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.
26:24:6:For this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted with filth, whose filth won't come off! Empty it piece by piece, but don't cast lots for them.
26:24:7:For her blood is still within her; she has left it on a bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
26:24:8:To arouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, so that it may not be covered.
26:24:9:Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I will make the pile of wood even larger.
26:24:10:Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, cook the meat well, mix in the spices, let the bones be burned up.
26:24:11:Then set the empty pot on the coals until it becomes hot and its copper glows, so that its impurities may be melted and its filth burned away.
26:24:12:But it is futile; the stubborn filth won't come off. Only fire will purge it.
26:24:13:You have indulged in filthy lewdness, and because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be purified from your uncleanness, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided.
26:24:14:I, the Lord, have spoken; it is coming, and I will act. I will not relent, nor will I show pity or compassion. You will be judged according to your ways and deeds, declares the Lord God."
26:24:15:Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
26:24:16:"Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears.
26:24:17:Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Bind on your turban, put your sandals on your feet, do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the customary food of mourners."
26:24:18:So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I was commanded.
26:24:19:The people asked me, "Won't you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting this way?"
26:24:20:I answered them, "The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
26:24:21:'Tell the people of Israel, "This is what the Lord God says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary—the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.
26:24:22:And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache or eat the customary food of mourners.
26:24:23:You will wear your turbans and put your sandals on your feet. You will not lament or weep but will waste away because of your sins and groan among yourselves.
26:24:24:Ezekiel is a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God.'"
26:24:25:And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, and their sons and daughters as well—
26:24:26:on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
26:24:27:On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you will speak and no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord."
26:25:1:The Lord's word came to me, saying:
26:25:2:Son of man, focus your attention on the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
26:25:3:Tell the Ammonites that this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you rejoiced when my sanctuary was desecrated, Israel was devastated, and the people of Judah went into exile,
26:25:4:Now I will hand you over to the people of the East. They will set up their camps among you and make their homes in your land. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
26:25:5:I will turn the city of Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and Ammon will become a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:25:6:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: You clapped your hands, stomped your feet, and rejoiced with contempt for the land of Israel.
26:25:7:So now, I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and eliminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the Lord.
26:25:8:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because Moab and Seir said, "Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,"
26:25:9:Therefore, I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim—the glory of the land.
26:25:10:I will hand Moab over, along with the Ammonites, to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations.
26:25:11:I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the Lord.
26:25:12:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because Edom took revenge on the house of Judah and became very guilty by doing so,
26:25:13:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off both people and animals from it. I will make it a wasteland from Teman to Dedan; they will fall by the sword.
26:25:14:I will take vengeance on Edom through my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to my anger and wrath. Then Edom will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:25:15:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah,
26:25:16:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, cutting off the Cherethites and destroying the remnant along the coast.
26:25:17:I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes, and they will know that I am the Lord when I take my vengeance upon them.
26:26:1:On the first day of the month, in the eleventh year, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
26:26:2:"Son of man, Tyre has mocked Jerusalem, saying, 'Aha! The gateway of the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me. Now that it lies in ruins, I will prosper.'
26:26:3:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Look, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the waves of the sea crashing against your shoreline.
26:26:4:They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers. I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock.
26:26:5:She will become a place for spreading nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord. She will be plundered by the nations,
26:26:6:and her mainland villages will be slaughtered by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26:26:7:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am bringing Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the king of kings, from the north, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great army.
26:26:8:He will slay your mainland villages with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp against your walls, and raise his shields against you.
26:26:9:He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons.
26:26:10:His horses will be so numerous that their dust will cover you. Your walls will tremble at the noise of warriors, chariots, and cavalry when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached.
26:26:11:His hooves will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
26:26:12:They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses. Your stones, timber, and rubble will be cast into the sea.
26:26:13:I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more.
26:26:14:I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place for spreading nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, the Lord, have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:26:15:This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place within you?
26:26:16:Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling and sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you.
26:26:17:They will take up a lament for you and say to you, 'How you have perished, O city of renown, inhabited by seafaring men! You were strong in the sea, you and your inhabitants, who spread terror among all who lived there.
26:26:18:Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall; the islands in the sea are terrified at your demise.'
26:26:19:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: When I make you a desolate city like other deserted cities, and when I bring the deep over you and its vast waters cover you,
26:26:20:then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the earth below, like ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit. You will not return or take your place in the land of the living.
26:26:21:I will bring you to a horrible end, and you will be no more. You will be sought but never found again, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:27:1:In this chapter, the Lord tells Ezekiel to sing a lament for Tyre, a wealthy city.
26:27:2:Son of man, say to Tyre, situated at the entrance of the sea, the trading center for the nations on many coastlines, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says:'
26:27:3:You boast, O Tyre, "I am perfect in beauty!"
26:27:4:Your borders extend into the heart of the seas; your builders perfected your beauty.
26:27:5:They constructed all your planking with cypress trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26:27:6:From oaks of Bashan they made your oars; they crafted your deck with ivory-inlaid boxwood from the coasts of Cyprus.
26:27:7:Fine embroidered linen from Egypt served as your sail, which became your banner; blue and purple fabric from the coasts of Elishah covered you.
26:27:8:The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your skilled rowers; your wise men, O Tyre, were aboard as your navigators.
26:27:9:Elders from Gebal and its skilled craftsmen were with you, repairing your leaks; all the ships of the sea and their sailors gathered to trade with you.
26:27:10:Men of Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, serving as your warriors; they hung shields and helmets in you, enhancing your splendor.
26:27:11:The men of Arvad and Helech stood guard on your walls; Gammadites were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls, perfecting your beauty.
26:27:12:Tarshish did business with you because of your abundant wealth; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise.
26:27:13:Greece, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you, exchanging slaves and bronze items for your goods.
26:27:14:People from Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, warhorses, and mules for your merchandise.
26:27:15:The people of Rhodes traded with you; many coastlands were your customers; they paid you in ivory tusks and ebony.
26:27:16:Aram did business with you because of your abundant goods; they exchanged turquoise, purple fabric, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your merchandise.
26:27:17:Judah and Israel traded with you, offering wheat from Minnith, confections, honey, oil, and balm as payment for your goods.
26:27:18:Damascus did business with you due to your abundant products and great wealth; they offered wine from Helbon and white wool.
26:27:19:Vedan and Javan from Uzal provided wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane for your wares.
26:27:20:Dedan traded saddle blankets with you.
26:27:21:Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers, dealing in lambs, rams, and goats with you.
26:27:22:The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you, offering the finest spices, precious stones, and gold in exchange for your goods.
26:27:23:Haran, Canneh, Eden, merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Kilmad conducted trade with you.
26:27:24:These merchants brought you colorful garments, blue fabric, embroidered work, multicolored rugs, and tightly woven cords as payment for your merchandise.
26:27:25:Ships of Tarshish carried your goods; you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas.
26:27:26:Your rowers have brought you into turbulent waters; the east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas.
26:27:27:Your wealth, merchandise, goods, sailors, navigators, ship repairers, traders, and warriors will all sink into the depths of the sea on the day of your downfall.
26:27:28:The sound of your sailors' cries will cause the coastlands to tremble.
26:27:29:All who handle the oars will abandon their ships; sailors and navigators will stand on the shore.
26:27:30:They will raise their voices and wail bitterly over you; they will throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.
26:27:31:They will shave their heads in mourning for you, wear sackcloth, and weep with bitter anguish.
26:27:32:In their lamentation, they will sing a dirge for you, mourning, 'Who was like Tyre, silenced in the midst of the sea?'
26:27:33:When your merchandise went out to sea, you satisfied many nations; with your abundant wealth and goods, you enriched the kings of the earth.
26:27:34:Now you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and all your crew have gone down with you.
26:27:35:All who live on the coastlands are appalled at your fate; their kings shudder with fear, their faces distorted with terror.
26:27:36:The merchants among the nations scoff at you; you have become a horror, and you will be no more.
26:28:1:This is what the Lord God says: O ruler of Tyre, your heart is proud, and you say, "I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas." But you are just a man, not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.
26:28:2:Look, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you.
26:28:3:With your wisdom and understanding, you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
26:28:4:By your great skill in trading, you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth, your heart has grown proud.
26:28:5:So this is what the Lord God says: Since you consider yourself equal to a god,
26:28:6:I will bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations. They will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor.
26:28:7:They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
26:28:8:Will you still say, "I am a god," in the presence of those who kill you? You will be just a man, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you.
26:28:9:You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. For I have spoken, declares the Lord God.
26:28:10:This is what the Lord God says: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26:28:11:You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared.
26:28:12:You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for I had ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
26:28:13:Your conduct was blameless from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you.
26:28:14:Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you out from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
26:28:15:Your heart became proud because of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
26:28:16:By your many sins and dishonest trade, you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made fire come out from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.
26:28:17:All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.
26:28:18:The word of the Lord came to me:
26:28:19:Son of man, wail for the king of Tyre and say to him: This is what the Lord God says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26:28:20:You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared.
26:28:21:You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for I had ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
26:28:22:Your conduct was blameless from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you.
26:28:23:Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you out from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
26:28:24:Your heart became proud because of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
26:28:25:By your many sins and dishonest trade, you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made fire come out from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.
26:28:26:All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.
26:29:1:In the tenth year, during the tenth month, on the twelfth day, the Lord spoke to me, saying:
26:29:2:"Son of man, direct your attention towards Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and the entire nation of Egypt.
26:29:3:Tell them that this is what the Sovereign Lord says: 'I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt. You are like a great monster lying in the Nile River; you claim that you created the river and own it.
26:29:4:But I will put hooks in your jaws and cause the fish of your rivers to cling to your scales. I will drag you out of your river, along with all the fish clinging to your scales.
26:29:5:I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish from your rivers. You will not be picked up or buried; instead, you will become food for the wild animals and birds.
26:29:6:All the people of Egypt will know that I am the Lord when their support fails them. They have been like a reed staff for the people of Israel.
26:29:7:When they reached out to you for support, you broke and tore open their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you splintered, causing their legs to give way.
26:29:8:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will bring a sword upon you and cut off both people and animals from you.
26:29:9:Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the Lord because you claimed, "The Nile is mine, and I made it."
26:29:10:So now, I am against you and your rivers. I will turn Egypt into a desolate wasteland, from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush.
26:29:11:No human or animal will walk through it, and no one will live there for forty years.
26:29:12:I will make Egypt the most desolate among devastated nations, and its cities will lie in ruins more than any other city for forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.
26:29:13:But this is what the Sovereign Lord says: At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered.
26:29:14:I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin. There they will be a lowly kingdom.
26:29:15:Egypt will be the least of all kingdoms and never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will weaken them so that they will never again rule over the nations.
26:29:16:Israel will never again trust in Egypt. Instead, they will remember their guilt when they turned to Egypt for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.'"
26:29:17:In the twenty-seventh year, during the first month, on the first day, the Lord spoke to me, saying:
26:29:18:"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army work hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bare, and every shoulder chafed. Yet neither he nor his army received any reward from Tyre for the labor they expended on it.
26:29:19:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will carry off its wealth, plunder its resources, and take its spoil as a reward for his army.
26:29:20:I have given him Egypt as payment for his efforts because he and his army worked for me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:29:21:On that day, I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will give you, Ezekiel, the words to speak among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
26:30:1:On that day, the Lord's message came to me, saying:
26:30:2:Son of man, prophesy and say, "This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Wail and cry out, 'Alas for the day!'
26:30:3:For the day is near, a day of clouds and darkness; it will be a time of doom for the nations.
26:30:4:A sword will come upon Egypt, and anguish will be in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt, and her wealth is taken away, and her foundations are torn down.
26:30:5:Cush, Put, Lud, Arabia, Libya, and all the mixed people, along with the children of the land that is allied with them, will fall by the sword."
26:30:6:This is what the Lord says: "Egypt's supporters will fall, and her proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene, they will fall by the sword within her, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:30:7:They will be desolate among desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
26:30:8:Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are shattered.
26:30:9:On that day, messengers will go forth from my presence in ships to frighten Cush into submission. Panic will seize them on the day of Egypt's doom, for it is coming.
26:30:10:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: "I will put an end to Egypt's wealth by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26:30:11:He and his army, the most ruthless of nations, will be brought in to devastate the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
26:30:12:I will dry up the waters of the Nile and sell the land to wicked men. I will bring destruction upon the land and everything in it, by the hands of foreigners. I, the Lord, have spoken."
26:30:13:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: "I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis. There will no longer be a prince in Egypt, and I will spread fear throughout the land.
26:30:14:I will lay waste to Pathros, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments on Thebes.
26:30:15:I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the hordes of Thebes.
26:30:16:I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in agony. Thebes will be breached, and Memphis will face daily distress.
26:30:17:The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity.
26:30:18:Darkness will cover Tehaphnehes when I break the yoke of Egypt and her proud strength comes to an end. A cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity.
26:30:19:Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord."
26:31:1:In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying:
26:31:2:"Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt and his people: Who do you think you are, comparing yourself to a mighty cedar in Lebanon? With beautiful branches providing shade for all, its top towering among the clouds?
26:31:3:Look at the Assyrian, a cedar in Lebanon with lovely branches, dense foliage, and soaring height; it reached the highest clouds.
26:31:4:Waters nourished it, the deep made it grow tall, sending its rivers around the place where it was planted, and directing its streams to all the trees of the field.
26:31:5:Because of this, it grew taller than any other tree, and its branches multiplied, while its boughs grew long and spread far and wide, because it had abundant water to grow.
26:31:6:All the birds of the sky nested in its branches, and under its boughs all the wild animals gave birth. In its shade, every great nation lived.
26:31:7:It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots reached down to abundant waters.
26:31:8:The cedars in God's garden could not rival it, nor could the junipers equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches—no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.
26:31:9:I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.
26:31:10:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds, and its heart became proud of its height,
26:31:11:I handed it over to the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with it according to its wickedness. I cast it down.
26:31:12:Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations, cut it down and left it; its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys, its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the peoples of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.
26:31:13:All the birds of the sky settled on the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lived among its branches.
26:31:14:This is so that no other trees by the waters may grow as tall as the cedars or reach their tops among the clouds, and none of the well-watered trees may stand so high. For they are all destined for death, to the depths of the earth, among the mortals who go down to the pit.
26:31:15:This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day it was brought down to the realm of the dead, I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it, I clothed Lebanon in gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away.
26:31:16:I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the realm of the dead to be with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the trees that were well-watered, were consoled in the earth below.
26:31:17:They also went down with it to the realm of the dead, joining those killed by the sword, along with those who were its allies, those who lived in its shade among the nations.
26:31:18:Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign LORD."
26:32:1:In the twelfth year, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:
26:32:2:Son of man, sing a lament for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and tell him: You compare yourself to a mighty lion among the nations, but you are like a sea monster in the seas, thrashing about in your rivers, stirring up the waters with your feet and fouling their streams.
26:32:3:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will cast my net over you with a host of many nations, and they will haul you up in my net.
26:32:4:I will leave you on the land; I will throw you into the open field. I will let all the birds of the sky settle on you and all the wild animals gorge themselves on you.
26:32:5:I will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.
26:32:6:I will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains, and the ravines will be filled with your remains.
26:32:7:When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will veil the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.
26:32:8:All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you; I will bring darkness upon your land, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:32:9:I will trouble the hearts of many nations when I bring about your destruction among the nations, into countries you have not known.
26:32:10:I will make many people appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when I brandish my sword before them. On the day of your downfall, each of them will tremble every moment for his life.
26:32:11:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.
26:32:12:I will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty men, the most ruthless of all nations. They will devastate the pride of Egypt, and all its hordes will be destroyed.
26:32:13:I will also destroy all its cattle from beside abundant waters, so that no human foot will muddy them again or disturb them with their hooves.
26:32:14:Then I will let their waters settle and make their rivers flow like oil, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:32:15:When I turn the land of Egypt into desolation and it becomes a wasteland stripped of everything in it, then they will know that I am the Lord.
26:32:16:This is the lament they will chant for her; the daughters of the nations will chant it. Over Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:32:17:In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:
26:32:18:Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations, along with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:19:Say to them, 'Are you more favored than others? Go down and lie among the uncircumcised.'
26:32:20:They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; let her and all her hordes be dragged away.
26:32:21:From within the realm of the dead, the mighty leaders will say of Egypt and her allies, 'They have come down and lie with the uncircumcised, those killed by the sword.'
26:32:22:Assyria is there with her whole army; she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain, all who have fallen by the sword.
26:32:23:Their graves are in the depths of the pit, and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living are now dead, fallen by the sword.
26:32:24:Elam is there, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword. They went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, those who spread their terror in the land of the living. Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:25:Among the slain they have made a bed for her with all her hordes, and her graves are around it. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Although their terror was once spread in the land of the living, they now bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid among the slain.
26:32:26:Meshek and Tubal are there, with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, for they spread their terror in the land of the living.
26:32:27:They do not lie with the fallen warriors of old, who went down to the realm of the dead with their weapons of war—their swords placed under their heads and their shields resting on their bones—though these warriors also had terrorized the land of the living.
26:32:28:You too, Pharaoh, will be broken and will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.
26:32:29:Edom is there, her kings and all her princes; despite their power, they are laid with those killed by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:30:All the leaders of the north and all the Sidonians are there; they have gone down in disgrace with the slain, despite the terror caused by their power. They lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
26:32:31:Pharaoh—he and all his army—will see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:32:32:For I had caused my terror in the land of the living; and he will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:33:1:Now, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:33:2:"Son of man, speak to your people and tell them, 'When I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of that land choose one of their own to be a watchman,
26:33:3:if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,
26:33:4:then anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet but does not heed the warning, when the sword comes and takes them away, their blood will be on their own head.
26:33:5:They heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning; their blood will be upon themselves. But if they had taken warning, they would have saved their lives.
26:33:6:But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone's life, that person's blood will be on the watchman's head, for he failed to give warning.
26:33:7:As for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. So hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.
26:33:8:When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their lives, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.
26:33:9:But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.
26:33:10:Now, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what you have been saying: "Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?"'
26:33:11:Tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?'
26:33:12:And you, son of man, say to your people, 'The righteousness of the righteous person will not save them when they disobey, and the wickedness of the wicked person will not cause them to stumble when they turn from it. The righteous person, if they sin, will not be able to live by their righteousness.'
26:33:13:If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things they have done will be remembered; they will die for the evil they have done.
26:33:14:And if I say to a wicked person, 'You will surely die,' but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right—
26:33:15:if they return pledges, repay what they have stolen, and follow the decrees that give life, doing no evil—that wicked person will surely live; they will not die.
26:33:16:None of the sins they have committed will be remembered against them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live.
26:33:17:Yet your people say, 'The Lord's way is not fair.' But it is their own way that is not fair!
26:33:18:When the righteous turn from their righteousness and do evil, they will die for it.
26:33:19:And when the wicked turn from their wickedness and do what is just and right, they will live by doing so.
26:33:20:Yet you say, 'The Lord's way is not fair.' People of Israel, I will judge each of you according to your own ways."
26:33:21:In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a survivor from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has fallen!"
26:33:22:Now the evening before the survivor arrived, the hand of the Lord was on me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.
26:33:23:Then the word of the Lord came to me:
26:33:24:"Son of man, those who live in these ruins in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.'
26:33:25:So tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You eat meat with blood in it, you look to your idols, and you shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
26:33:26:You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?'
26:33:27:Say this to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: As surely as I live, those who are in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague.
26:33:28:I will make the land a desolate waste, and the pride of her strength will come to an end; the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them.
26:33:29:Then they will know that I am the Lord when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.'
26:33:30:As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, 'Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord.'
26:33:31:My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain.
26:33:32:Indeed, to them you are nothing more than a singer of love songs, one who has a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice.
26:33:33:When all this comes true—and it surely will—then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
26:34:1:Then this message came to me from the Lord:
26:34:2:"Son of man, speak out against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds who only take care of yourselves! Shouldn't you be taking care of the sheep?
26:34:3:You eat the fat, wear the wool, and slaughter the best animals, but you don't tend to the sheep.
26:34:4:You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them harshly and brutally.
26:34:5:So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered, they became food for wild animals.
26:34:6:My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered across the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.
26:34:7:Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
26:34:8:As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, my sheep have become prey and food for wild animals since there was no shepherd. And my shepherds did not search for my sheep, but cared only for themselves.
26:34:9:So, you shepherds, listen to the word of the Lord:
26:34:10:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my sheep. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, and they will no longer be food for them.
26:34:11:For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.
26:34:12:As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
26:34:13:I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements of the land.
26:34:14:I will tend them in good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26:34:15:I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:34:16:I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice.
26:34:17:As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats.
26:34:18:Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
26:34:19:Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26:34:20:Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away,
26:34:21:I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another.
26:34:22:I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd.
26:34:23:I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I, the Lord, have spoken.
26:34:24:I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety.
26:34:25:I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing.
26:34:26:The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the Lord when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them.
26:34:27:They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid.
26:34:28:I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.
26:34:29:Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:34:30:You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign Lord.'"
26:35:1:Now, this is the message that came to me from the Lord concerning Mount Seir:
26:35:2:Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir and prophesy against it.
26:35:3:Declare to it, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, making you desolate and a wasteland.
26:35:4:I will reduce your cities to ruins, and you will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:35:5:You have harbored an ancient hatred and handed over the Israelites to the sword in their time of calamity, when their punishment reached its climax.
26:35:6:Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will give you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
26:35:7:I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, wiping out all who come and go.
26:35:8:I will fill its mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
26:35:9:I will make you desolate forever, and your cities will never be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:35:10:You said, "These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will take possession of them," even though I, the Lord, was there.
26:35:11:So, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I will treat you according to the anger and envy you showed in your hatred for them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
26:35:12:You will know that I, the Lord, have heard all the contemptible things you said against the mountains of Israel. You said, "They are laid waste and have been given over to us to devour."
26:35:13:You boasted against me with your mouth, and you multiplied your words against me. I heard it.
26:35:14:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
26:35:15:As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so will I do to you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, along with all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'
26:36:1:In those days, the Lord spoke to me, saying,
26:36:2:"Son of man, speak to the mountains of Israel and say, 'You mountains, hear the word of the Lord.
26:36:3:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: The enemy has taunted you, saying, "Aha! The ancient high places are now ours!"
26:36:4:Therefore, prophesy and declare, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and an object of gossip and slander among the people,
26:36:5:So I will raise my hand against them, and make the land desolate, even more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'"
26:36:6:Proclaim this message: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I have heard the insults of the nations against you, mountains of Israel.
26:36:7:Thus says the Lord God: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who have taken my land as their possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might plunder its pasturelands.'
26:36:8:Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I swear that the nations surrounding you will also suffer disgrace.
26:36:9:But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon return.
26:36:10:I will multiply the number of people upon you, the whole house of Israel, even all of it; the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruins rebuilt.
26:36:11:I will increase the number of people and animals on you; they will be fruitful and multiply. I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and I will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26:36:12:Yes, I will cause my people Israel to walk upon you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance. You will never again deprive them of their children.'
26:36:13:Thus says the Lord God: 'Because they say to you, "You devour men and bereave your nation of children,"
26:36:14:Therefore, you shall no longer devour men nor bereave your nation of children,' declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:36:15:'I will not let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore, nor will you suffer the reproach of the peoples or cause your nation to stumble,' declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:36:16:Again, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
26:36:17:"Son of man, when the people of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their ways were like the impurity of a menstruating woman in my sight.
26:36:18:So I poured out my wrath on them because they shed blood in the land and because they defiled it with their idols.
26:36:19:I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions.
26:36:20:Wherever they went among the nations, they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, 'These are the people of the Lord, yet they had to leave his land.'
26:36:21:But I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.
26:36:22:Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
26:36:23:I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Sovereign Lord, when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.
26:36:24:For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the countries, and bring you back into your own land.
26:36:25:Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
26:36:26:I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26:36:27:I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws.
26:36:28:You will live in the land I gave to your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.
26:36:29:I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful, and I will not bring famine upon you.
26:36:30:I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine.
26:36:31:Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.
26:36:32:Know this, people of Israel, I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign Lord. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!
26:36:33:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt.
26:36:34:The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it.
26:36:35:They will say, 'This land that was laid waste has become like the Garden of Eden; the cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.'
26:36:36:Then the nations around you that remain will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it."
26:36:37:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Once again I will yield to the plea of the house of Israel and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep.
26:36:38:As the holy flocks that fill Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26:37:1:The Lord's power came over me, and He led me out by His Spirit to a valley filled with bones.
26:37:2:He guided me around them, showing me there were many bones on the valley floor, and they were very dry.
26:37:3:Then He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" I replied, "Only You know that, Lord."
26:37:4:He said to me, "Prophesy to these bones and tell them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!'
26:37:5:This is what the Lord God says: I will put breath into you, and you will come back to life.
26:37:6:I will attach tendons to you, place flesh upon you, cover you with skin, and breathe life into you. You will live, and you will know that I am the Lord.'"
26:37:7:So I prophesied as I was commanded, and as I did, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone.
26:37:8:I watched as tendons and flesh appeared on them, and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
26:37:9:Then He told me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 'This is what the Lord God says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, so they may live.'"
26:37:10:I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.
26:37:11:Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones represent the people of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is gone; we are cut off.'
26:37:12:So prophesy and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says: My people, I will open your graves and bring you back to the land of Israel.
26:37:13:You will know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and bring you up from them.
26:37:14:I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. I will settle you in your own land, and then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and done it, declares the Lord.'"
26:37:15:The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,
26:37:16:"Son of man, take a stick and write on it, 'For Judah and for the Israelites associated with him.' Then take another stick and write on it, 'For Joseph—the stick of Ephraim—and for all the house of Israel associated with him.'
26:37:17:Now join them together into one stick, so they become one in your hand.
26:37:18:When your people ask you, 'Won't you tell us what you mean by this?'
26:37:19:Say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in Ephraim's hand, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Judah, making them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.'
26:37:20:Hold the sticks you've written on before their eyes.
26:37:21:Then say to them, 'This is what the Lord God says: I will gather the Israelites from the nations where they have been scattered, and I will bring them back to their own land.
26:37:22:I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. They will have one king, and they will never again be two nations or divided into two kingdoms.
26:37:23:They will no longer defile themselves with idols or detestable practices. I will save them from all their unfaithfulness in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
26:37:24:My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow My laws and keep My decrees.
26:37:25:They will live in the land I gave to My servant Jacob, where their ancestors lived. They and their children and their children's children will live there forever, and David My servant will be their prince forever.
26:37:26:I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them, increase their numbers, and place My sanctuary among them forever.
26:37:27:My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be My people.
26:37:28:The nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel when My sanctuary is among them forever.'"
26:38:1:This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief ruler of Meshech and Tubal.
26:38:2:I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and lead you out with all your army, including horses and riders, all fully armed—a great company with shields and bucklers, brandishing swords.
26:38:3:Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all with shields and helmets.
26:38:4:Gomer and all its troops, as well as Beth-togarmah from the far north and all its forces—many nations are with you.
26:38:5:Get ready and be prepared, you and all the companies that are gathered about you, and take command of them.
26:38:6:After many days, you will be called to arms. In future years, you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live securely.
26:38:7:You and all your troops and the many nations with you must prepare for action; be a guard for them.
26:38:8:After a long time, you will be summoned. In the last years, you will come into a land that has been restored from the sword, where people have been gathered from many nations on the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. But its people were brought out from the nations, and they dwell securely.
26:38:9:You will advance like a storm; you will come like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.
26:38:10:This is what the Lord God says: On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
26:38:11:You will say, "I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will attack those who are at rest and live securely, all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates."
26:38:12:To seize spoil and carry off plunder, you will turn your hand against the resettled ruins, against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods and dwell in the center of the land.
26:38:13:Sheba, Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its leaders, will say to you, "Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hordes to carry off plunder, to take away silver and gold, to take livestock and goods, and to seize much spoil?"
26:38:14:Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, "This is what the Lord God says: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know it?
26:38:15:You will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all riding horses—a great horde, a mighty army.
26:38:16:You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I show myself holy through you before their eyes, O Gog."
26:38:17:This is what the Lord God says: Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?
26:38:18:On that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord God, my wrath will be aroused.
26:38:19:In my zeal and fiery wrath, I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
26:38:20:The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all mankind on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground.
26:38:21:I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord God. Every man's sword will be against his brother.
26:38:22:With pestilence and bloodshed, I will enter into judgment with him; I will rain down torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.
26:38:23:And I will show my greatness and holiness, making myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26:39:1:Listen up, Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal! This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you.
26:39:2:I'll turn you around, drag you along, bring you from the far north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel.
26:39:3:Then I'll strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
26:39:4:On the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops will fall, as well as the nations with you. I will give you to the birds of prey and wild animals to be devoured.
26:39:5:You'll fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:39:6:I'll send fire on Magog and those who live securely on the coastlands. Then they'll know that I am the Lord.
26:39:7:I'll make my holy name known among my people Israel, never again letting it be profaned. The nations will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.
26:39:8:This is coming, and it will happen, declares the Sovereign Lord. This is the day I have spoken about.
26:39:9:Then the inhabitants of Israel's cities will go out, kindling fires with the weapons—shields, bows, arrows, clubs, and spears—and burn them for seven years.
26:39:10:They won't need to gather wood from the fields or cut down trees from the forests, because they'll use the weapons for fuel. They'll plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:39:11:On that day, I'll give Gog a burial place in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers' path, and there they'll bury Gog and all his horde. They'll call it the Valley of Hamon-Gog.
26:39:12:For seven months, the people of Israel will be burying them to cleanse the land.
26:39:13:All the people of the land will help with the burial, and they'll be honored on the day I reveal my glory, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:39:14:Men will be appointed to continually search the land for any who remain unburied, so they can cleanse it. After the seven months, they'll begin their search.
26:39:15:As they go through the land, if anyone sees a human bone, they'll place a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog.
26:39:16:A city named Hamonah will also be there. This is how they'll cleanse the land.
26:39:17:Now, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind of bird and wild animal: Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I'm preparing for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel. You'll eat the flesh and drink the blood.
26:39:18:You'll eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as if they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all fattened animals from Bashan.
26:39:19:At the feast I've prepared for you, you'll eat fat till you're full and drink blood till you're drunk.
26:39:20:You'll be filled at my table with horses and riders, mighty men, and all kinds of warriors, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:39:21:I'll display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgment I've executed and the strong hand I've used against them.
26:39:22:From that day forward, the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.
26:39:23:The nations will also know that the people of Israel went into exile because of their sin, as they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, causing them all to fall by the sword.
26:39:24:I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions, and I hid my face from them.
26:39:25:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, showing my zeal for my holy name.
26:39:26:They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived securely in their land, with no one to make them afraid.
26:39:27:When I bring them back from the nations and gather them from the countries of their enemies, I will demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of many nations.
26:39:28:Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind.
26:39:29:I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:40:1:In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years after the city had fallen, on that very day, the hand of the Lord was upon me and brought me there.
26:40:2:In visions of God, He took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain, where there was a structure like a city to the south.
26:40:3:He led me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze. He was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
26:40:4:The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes and listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I show you, for you have been brought here so that I can show it to you. Tell the people of Israel everything you see."
26:40:5:I saw an outer wall surrounding the temple area. The man's measuring rod was six long cubits, each one longer than the usual cubit. He measured the thickness of the wall as one rod and its height as one rod.
26:40:6:Then he went to the east gate and climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate as one rod deep.
26:40:7:Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide, with space between the guardrooms being five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the vestibule facing the temple was one rod deep.
26:40:8:He also measured the vestibule of the gateway inside.
26:40:9:The vestibule of the gateway was eight cubits, and its jambs were two cubits. The vestibule of the gateway faced the temple.
26:40:10:There were three guardrooms on each side of the east gate, all three having the same measurements, and the jambs on either side also had the same measurements.
26:40:11:He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway as ten cubits and its length as thirteen cubits.
26:40:12:In front of each guardroom was a barrier one cubit wide, and the guardrooms were six cubits square.
26:40:13:He measured the gateway from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits, with the openings facing each other.
26:40:14:He made the supporting columns sixty cubits high, with the outer court extending around the gateway.
26:40:15:From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
26:40:16:There were narrow windows for the guardrooms and for their jambs inside the gateway all around, as well as for the arches. Palm trees decorated the jambs on either side.
26:40:17:Then he brought me into the outer court. There were chambers and a pavement laid out all around the court, with thirty rooms facing the pavement.
26:40:18:The pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
26:40:19:He measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside as a hundred cubits, both on the east and the north.
26:40:20:The north gate of the outer court was also measured, with its length and width.
26:40:21:It had three guardrooms on each side, with the same measurements as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits.
26:40:22:Its windows, vestibule, and palm tree decorations had the same measurements as the east gate. Seven steps led up to it, with its vestibule facing inward.
26:40:23:Opposite the north gate was a gate to the inner court, just as there was for the east gate. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.
26:40:24:Next, he led me to the south side, where there was also a south gate. He measured its jambs and its vestibule, and they had the same measurements as the others.
26:40:25:The gate and its vestibule had windows all around, like the other windows. Its length was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits.
26:40:26:There were seven steps going up to it, with its vestibule facing inward, and palm tree decorations on its jambs, one on each side.
26:40:27:There was also a gate to the inner court on the south side. He measured from this gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.
26:40:28:He brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
26:40:29:Its guardrooms, jambs, and vestibule had the same measurements as the others. The gate and its vestibule had windows all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits.
26:40:30:There were porticoes all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
26:40:31:The vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees decorated the jambs. There were eight steps leading up to it.
26:40:32:He led me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
26:40:33:Its guardrooms, jambs, and vestibule had the same measurements as the others. The gate and its vestibule had windows all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits.
26:40:34:Its portico faced the outer court, and palm trees decorated the jambs on either side. There were eight steps leading up to it.
26:40:35:He took me to the north gate and measured it; it also had the same measurements as the others.
26:40:36:Its guardrooms, jambs, and vestibule had the same measurements as the others. The gate had windows all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits.
26:40:37:Its portico faced the outer court, and palm trees decorated the jambs on either side. There were eight steps leading up to it.
26:40:38:A chamber with a doorway was by the jambs of the gates, where the burnt offerings were to be washed.
26:40:39:In the vestibule of the gate were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were to be slaughtered.
26:40:40:On the outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables, and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate, there were two tables as well.
26:40:41:Four tables were on one side of the gate, and four tables on the other side—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
26:40:42:There were also four tables for the burnt offerings, made of cut stone, one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one cubit high. The instruments used to slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices were placed on these tables.
26:40:43:Double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were fastened all around the inside of the building, and the flesh of the offerings was to be laid on the tables.
26:40:44:Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were two chambers, one at the side of the north gate facing south, and another at the side of the south gate facing north.
26:40:45:He said to me, "The chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,
26:40:46:and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the Lord to minister to Him."
26:40:47:He measured the court; it was a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, a perfect square. The altar was in front of the temple.
26:40:48:Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits, and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side.
26:40:49:The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and its width was eleven cubits. There were steps leading up to it, and pillars stood by the jambs, one on each side.
26:41:1:Afterward, the man brought me to the temple and measured its walls. The thickness of the side walls was 10 feet, and the width of the entrance was 17 feet.
26:41:2:The width of the entrance room was 13 feet, and the side walls along the entrance were 6 feet wide on each side. He also measured the length of the room, which was 40 feet, and its width, 27 feet.
26:41:3:Then he went further inside and measured the entrance to the inner sanctuary. It was 10 feet wide, and the walls on either side of it were 8 feet thick. The width of the inner sanctuary was 34 feet.
26:41:4:He measured the inner sanctuary; its length was 34 feet, and its width was also 34 feet. "This is the most holy place," he told me.
26:41:5:Next, he measured the wall of the temple; it was 10 feet thick. There were side rooms all around the temple, each measuring 9 feet wide and 20 feet long.
26:41:6:The side rooms were arranged in three levels, one above another, with thirty rooms on each level. The temple's outer wall included ledges for the side rooms, so they didn't need to be built into the wall itself.
26:41:7:The side rooms increased in width as they ascended from level to level, corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall. This allowed more space for the upper rooms and a stairway leading from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.
26:41:8:I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, which formed the foundation for the side rooms. It was the height of a rod, or about 10 feet.
26:41:9:The outer wall of the side rooms was 9 feet thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple and the priests' rooms was 27 feet wide.
26:41:10:There were two rows of rooms on the north and south sides of the temple, facing the open area. They were designated as priests' rooms.
26:41:11:The doors of the side rooms opened onto a walkway that ran around the temple. One door faced north, and another faced south.
26:41:12:At the western end of the temple, there was a large building with a width of 90 feet and a length of 135 feet. Its walls were 9 feet thick all around.
26:41:13:He measured the length of the temple, which was 170 feet, including the open area at the back of the temple.
26:41:14:The width of the temple's front courtyard, along with its walls, was 100 feet.
26:41:15:He measured the length of the building facing the temple courtyard at the west end, including its walls on both sides; it was 175 feet.
26:41:16:The sanctuary, the inner room, and the entrance room had wood paneling on their walls. All the walls, from the floor to the windows, were covered with carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim.
26:41:17:Each cherub had two faces: a human face looking toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion's face looking toward the palm tree on the other. This pattern was repeated throughout the temple.
26:41:18:The carved figures of cherubim and palm trees extended from the floor to the space above the entrance.
26:41:19:The walls of the inner sanctuary were adorned with cherubim and palm trees, just like the walls of the entrance room.
26:41:20:The altar was made of wood, measuring 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. Its corners, base, and sides were also made of wood. The man said to me, "This is the table that stands before the Lord."
26:41:21:The temple and the sanctuary both had double doors.
26:41:22:Each door had two swinging panels, making a total of four panels for each set of double doors.
26:41:23:Carved cherubim and palm trees decorated the doors, just as they did on the walls. There was a wooden canopy extending over the front of the entrance room.
26:41:24:Windows with latticework and palm trees were carved on the side walls of the entrance room, as well as on the walls of the sanctuary's outer hallway.
26:42:1:Next, he brought me to the outer court on the north side, and led me to the rooms opposite the separate area and opposite the building to the north.
26:42:2:These rooms were 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide, with doors facing north.
26:42:3:Opposite the inner courtyard of 20 cubits and opposite the pavement of the outer court, there was a gallery facing gallery in three stories.
26:42:4:In front of the rooms, there was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and a 100 cubits long. Their doors faced north.
26:42:5:The upper rooms were narrower because the galleries took up more space from them than from the lower and middle floors of the building.
26:42:6:For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore, the upper chambers were set back more than the lower and middle ones.
26:42:7:Outside, there was a wall parallel to the rooms, toward the outer court, in front of the rooms, for 50 cubits.
26:42:8:For the length of the rooms in the outer court was 50 cubits, while the length facing the temple was 100 cubits.
26:42:9:Below these rooms was an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
26:42:10:In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south side, facing the separate area and the building, there were also rooms.
26:42:11:With a walkway in front of them, they were like the rooms on the north side. They had the same length, width, and all their exits; and both had similar entrances.
26:42:12:Similar to the doorways on the north side, there was an entrance at the base of the wall on the south side. One could reach it by going east along a walkway in front of the wall.
26:42:13:Then he said to me, "The north and south rooms facing the separate area are the holy rooms where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There, they will place the most holy offerings—the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for the place is holy.
26:42:14:Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court without leaving their holy garments behind, for these garments are holy. They will put on other clothes before approaching the area reserved for the people."
26:42:15:When he had finished measuring the inner temple, he led me out through the east-facing gate and measured the entire area around it.
26:42:16:He used a measuring rod that was six long cubits, each with a length of a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was 500 rods.
26:42:17:He measured the north side with the measuring rod; it was 500 rods.
26:42:18:On the south side, he also measured 500 rods with the measuring rod.
26:42:19:Finally, he turned to the west side and measured 500 rods with the measuring rod.
26:42:20:So he measured the temple on all four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 rods long and 500 rods wide, to separate the holy from the common.
26:43:1:Afterward, he brought me to the gate facing east.
26:43:2:And there I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
26:43:3:The vision I saw was like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the vision I had seen by the River Chebar. I fell facedown on the ground.
26:43:4:The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.
26:43:5:Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
26:43:6:While the man stood beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple.
26:43:7:He said, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will no longer defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings at their high places.
26:43:8:When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.
26:43:9:Now let them put away their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings, and I will dwell among them forever.
26:43:10:You, son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection,
26:43:11:and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations.
26:43:12:This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. This is the law of the temple.
26:43:13:These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this is the height of the altar:
26:43:14:From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge, two cubits high and one cubit wide; from the smaller ledge up to the larger ledge, four cubits high and one cubit wide.
26:43:15:The altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth.
26:43:16:The hearth is square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.
26:43:17:The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim of half a cubit and a gutter of a cubit all around it. The steps of the altar face east."
26:43:18:Then he said to me, "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: These are the regulations for the altar when it is built, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed and blood may be sprinkled on it.
26:43:19:You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:43:20:You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it.
26:43:21:You are also to take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
26:43:22:On the second day, you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar shall be purified as it was purified with the bull.
26:43:23:When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.
26:43:24:You are to present them before the Lord, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
26:43:25:For seven days you shall provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.
26:43:26:For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it. In this way, they will consecrate it.
26:43:27:Once these days are over, on the eighth day and afterward, the priests shall present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign Lord."
26:44:1:In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me there.
26:44:2:Through visions of God, He brought me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain, where I saw what appeared to be a city built to the south.
26:44:3:When He brought me there, I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he stood in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
26:44:4:The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I'm going to show you, for this is why you have been brought here. Report everything you see to the house of Israel."
26:44:5:Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple area, and the man's measuring rod in his hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall as one rod and its height as another rod.
26:44:6:He went to the east gate, climbed its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.
26:44:7:Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide, and the space between the guardrooms was five cubits. The threshold of the inner gate, next to the portico facing the temple, was also one rod.
26:44:8:He measured the portico of the inner gate, which was one rod.
26:44:9:Then he measured the portico of the gate facing inward, which was eight cubits, and its side pillars were two cubits. The portico of the gate faced the temple.
26:44:10:Inside the east gate were three guardrooms on each side; the three were of equal size, and the side pillars on either side had the same measurement.
26:44:11:He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, which was ten cubits, and the length of the gateway, which was thirteen cubits.
26:44:12:There was a barrier before the guardrooms, one cubit on either side, and the guardrooms were six cubits square on either side.
26:44:13:Then he measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.
26:44:14:He also made posts sixty cubits high, and the courtyard extended around the gate.
26:44:15:From the front of the entrance at the beginning of the inner gate to the front of the portico of the inner gate was fifty cubits.
26:44:16:There were narrow windows in the guardrooms and in their side pillars within the gate all around, and similarly for the porticoes. There were windows all around inside, and on each side pillar were palm tree decorations.
26:44:17:Then he brought me into the outer court, where I saw chambers and a pavement made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
26:44:18:The pavement was alongside the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
26:44:19:Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside, which was a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side.
26:44:20:He measured the length and width of the north gate of the outer court.
26:44:21:The guardrooms, their side pillars, and the portico had the same measurements as those of the first gate. There were windows all around in it and its portico, like the windows of the others. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:44:22:Its windows, portico, and palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them.
26:44:23:There was a gate to the inner court directly across from the north gate, just as there was one on the east side. He measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
26:44:24:Then he led me to the south side, and I saw a gate on the south side. He measured its side pillars and portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.
26:44:25:There were windows all around in the gate and its portico, like the other windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:44:26:Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. It had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side.
26:44:27:The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits.
26:44:28:Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
26:44:29:Its guardrooms, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. There were windows all around in it and its portico, like the other windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:44:30:There were porticoes all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
26:44:31:Its portico faced the outer court, and palm tree decorations were on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps.
26:44:32:Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
26:44:33:Its guardrooms, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. There were windows all around in it and its portico, like the other windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:44:34:Its portico faced the outer court, and it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
26:44:35:Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it; it had the same measurements as the others.
26:44:36:Its guardrooms, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. There were windows all around in it and its portico, like the other windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26:44:37:Its side pillars faced the outer court, and it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
26:44:38:A chamber with a doorway was by the side pillars of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
26:44:39:Inside the portico of the gate were two tables on each side, on which they placed the burnt offering, sin offering, and guilt offering.
26:44:40:Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate's portico.
26:44:41:So there were four tables inside the gate and four tables outside, making a total of eight tables on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.
26:44:42:There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, each one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one cubit high. The utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices were placed on these tables.
26:44:43:Double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The meat of the offering was to be laid on the tables.
26:44:44:Inside the inner court were two rooms, one beside the north gate, facing south, and another beside the south gate, facing north.
26:44:45:He said to me, "The room facing south is for the priests who are in charge of the temple,
26:44:46:and the room facing north is for the priests who are in charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the only Levites who may approach the Lord to serve Him."
26:44:47:Then he measured the court, which was a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, forming a perfect square. The altar stood in front of the temple.
26:44:48:He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the side pillars of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits, and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side.
26:44:49:The length of the portico was twenty cubits, and its width eleven cubits. It was reached by a stairway, and there were pillars on each side of the entrance, one on either side.
26:45:1:In the division of land, you shall set aside an area for the Lord as a sacred district. This holy section will be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide.
26:45:2:Within this holy district, reserve a square plot of 500 by 500 cubits for the sanctuary, with a 50-cubit open space around it.
26:45:3:From this measured area, allocate a portion for the temple, which will include the Most Holy Place.
26:45:4:The remaining part of the sacred district will be for the priests who serve in the sanctuary, where they can have their homes and a place to maintain the temple.
26:45:5:Also, provide an area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide for the Levites who serve in the temple; this will be their possession for towns to live in.
26:45:6:Adjacent to the sacred district, designate an area for the city, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, for the whole house of Israel.
26:45:7:Next to the city's area, set aside a section for the prince. It will border both the sacred district and the city's property, extending westward from the holy district and eastward from the city.
26:45:8:This land will belong to the prince of Israel, ensuring that my princes no longer oppress my people. The rest of the land shall be given to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
26:45:9:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You have gone far enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression, and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:45:10:Use honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath for measurements.
26:45:11:The ephah and the bath shall be of equal volume, with the bath containing one-tenth of a homer and the ephah one-tenth of a homer. The standard measurement will be based on the homer.
26:45:12:The shekel shall weigh twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall equal one mina for you.
26:45:13:These are the offerings you must present: one-sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
26:45:14:Regarding the prescribed portion of oil, the measure is one percent of every cor (or ten baths) from each hundred baths, which equals a homer.
26:45:15:From the flock, offer one sheep out of every two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the people, declares the Sovereign Lord.
26:45:16:All the people of the land shall contribute to this offering for the prince in Israel.
26:45:17:It will be the prince's responsibility to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings during the festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths—at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
26:45:18:This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the first day of the first month, take a young bull without blemish and purify the sanctuary.
26:45:19:The priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.
26:45:20:Repeat this on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance. This way, you will make atonement for the temple.
26:45:21:On the fourteenth day of the first month, you shall celebrate the Feast of Passover, a seven-day festival during which you will eat bread made without yeast.
26:45:22:On that day, the prince must offer a bull as a sin offering for himself and all the people of the land.
26:45:23:During the seven days of the feast, he shall provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the Lord, along with a male goat each day for a sin offering.
26:45:24:He shall also provide a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:45:25:On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, during the Feast of Tabernacles, the prince must follow the same procedure for seven days, providing sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.
26:46:1:On the day of the New Moon and Sabbaths, the prince will enter through the entrance hall of the outer gate facing east, then he will stand by the gatepost while the priests offer his burnt offerings and peace offerings. He will worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave, but the gate will not be shut until evening.
26:46:2:The people of the land will also worship at the entrance of that gate on Sabbaths and New Moons before the Lord.
26:46:3:The prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering on the New Moon, along with six lambs and a ram without blemish.
26:46:4:The grain offering he gives to the priest will be an ephah for the bull, an ephah for the ram, and as much as he wants to give for the lambs, plus a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:5:On the Sabbath, he will offer six lambs without blemish, a ram, and a grain offering of an ephah for the ram, along with as much as he wants to give for the lambs, plus a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:6:During the New Moon, he will offer a young bull, six lambs, and a ram, all without blemish.
26:46:7:He will also provide a grain offering of an ephah for the bull, an ephah for the ram, and as much as he wants to give for the lambs, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:8:When the prince enters, he must go in through the entrance hall of the gate and leave the same way.
26:46:9:Whenever the people of the land come to worship the Lord during the appointed feasts, those who enter through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate, and those who enter through the south gate must leave through the north gate. They must not return through the gate they entered but go straight out.
26:46:10:The prince will be among them, entering and leaving with the people.
26:46:11:At the festivals and appointed feasts, the grain offering will be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and as much as one wants to give for the lambs, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
26:46:12:When the prince provides a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the Lord, the east-facing gate will be opened for him, and he will offer his burnt offerings and peace offerings just as he does on the Sabbath day. Afterward, he will leave, and the gate will be shut behind him.
26:46:13:Every day, he will provide a lamb without blemish, a year old, as a daily burnt offering to the Lord; this offering will be made every morning.
26:46:14:Along with the lamb, he will provide a grain offering every morning, consisting of one-sixth of an ephah and one-third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This will be a perpetual ordinance for the regular grain offering to the Lord.
26:46:15:They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.
26:46:16:This is what the Lord says: If the prince gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons, it will belong to his descendants and become their permanent possession.
26:46:17:But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to the servant only until the year of release, and then it will return to the prince. His inheritance is for his sons alone; it must remain theirs.
26:46:18:The prince must not take any of the people's inheritance by force or evict them from their property. He must provide his sons with an inheritance from his own property so that none of my people are dispossessed from their land.
26:46:19:Then he brought me through the entrance beside the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which were reserved for the priests. There, I saw a place at the far western end.
26:46:20:He said to me, "This is the place where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering so they do not have to carry them into the outer court, which would make the people holy."
26:46:21:Afterward, he brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners. In each corner, I saw another courtyard.
26:46:22:These smaller courtyards in the four corners of the outer court were identical, each measuring forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide.
26:46:23:All four corner courtyards had a row of masonry around them, with places for cooking built beneath the rows.
26:46:24:He said to me, "These are the kitchens where the temple servants will cook the sacrifices of the people."
26:47:1:In my vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple. There I saw water flowing out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar.
26:47:2:Then he led me out through the north gate and around to the outer gate facing east, and there the water was trickling from the south side.
26:47:3:As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through the water, which was ankle-deep.
26:47:4:He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through the water, which was now knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through the water, which was up to my waist.
26:47:5:Finally, he measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross.
26:47:6:He asked me, "Son of man, do you see this?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
26:47:7:When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river.
26:47:8:He said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh.
26:47:9:Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live.
26:47:10:Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea.
26:47:11:But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
26:47:12:Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing."
26:47:13:This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "These are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel, with two portions for Joseph.
26:47:14:You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance.
26:47:15:This is the boundary of the land: On the north side it will run from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad,
26:47:16:Berothah and Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26:47:17:The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary.
26:47:18:On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the eastern boundary.
26:47:19:On the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern boundary.
26:47:20:On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western boundary.
26:47:21:You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
26:47:22:You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26:47:23:In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance," declares the Sovereign LORD.
26:48:1:In the land that is divided among the twelve tribes of Israel, these are the portions they will receive. This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
26:48:2:Dan's portion will be in the northernmost part, extending from east to west.
26:48:3:Asher's territory will lie south of Dan's, also stretching from east to west.
26:48:4:Naphtali's land will be south of Asher's, with its borders running east to west.
26:48:5:Manasseh's portion will be situated south of Naphtali's, extending eastward and westward.
26:48:6:Ephraim's territory will be south of Manasseh's, with borders running from east to west.
26:48:7:Reuben's land will be located south of Ephraim's, stretching from east to west.
26:48:8:Judah's portion will be south of Reuben's, extending eastward and westward. A special area will be set aside for a holy district, which will be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide.
26:48:9:The holy district will be reserved for the Lord, measuring 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 cubits in width.
26:48:10:This sacred area will belong to the priests, with their homes situated on the northern side and the sanctuary of the temple on the southern side.
26:48:11:The priests who serve in the temple will come from the family of Zadok, as they have remained faithful to the Lord.
26:48:12:The Levites will have an adjacent area, measuring 25,000 cubits in length and 10,000 cubits in width.
26:48:13:Opposite the sacred area, there will be a section for the city, measuring 5,000 cubits by 25,000 cubits, which will belong to all Israel.
26:48:14:The remaining land will be for the prince, extending eastward and westward, and bordering the holy district on both sides.
26:48:15:The remaining territory, stretching from the western boundary of the holy district to the Mediterranean Sea, will belong to the prince.
26:48:16:The land will be divided among the tribes, with Benjamin's portion lying between Judah's territory and the holy district.
26:48:17:Simeon's land will be south of Benjamin's, also running east to west.
26:48:18:Issachar's territory will be situated south of Simeon's, stretching from east to west.
26:48:19:Zebulun's portion will lie south of Issachar's, extending eastward and westward.
26:48:20:Gad's land will be located south of Zebulun's, with borders running from east to west.
26:48:21:The southernmost border of Gad's territory will touch the southern tip of the Dead Sea, while the northern border will reach the Hethlon road, which leads to Hamath and Hazar Enan.
26:48:22:Thus, the land will be divided among the twelve tribes of Israel. The Sovereign Lord has spoken.
26:48:23:These are the portions that each tribe will receive, as determined by their names:
26:48:24:Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and Judah.
26:48:25:South of Judah's territory, the following tribes will have their portions: Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad.
26:48:26:The city will have twelve gates, each named after a tribe of Israel.
26:48:27:The gates will be arranged as follows: three on the north side, three on the east side, three on the south side, and three on the west side.
26:48:28:The circumference of the city will be 18,000 cubits, and from that day on, the city's name will be "The Lord is There."
