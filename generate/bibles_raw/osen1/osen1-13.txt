13:5:20:They cried out to God during the battle, and he granted their request because they trusted in him. So the Hagrites and all their allies were defeated.
13:5:21:They seized the livestock of the Hagrites—50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys—and took 100,000 people captive.
13:5:22:Many fell slain, because the battle was God's. They lived in their territory until the exile.
13:5:23:The people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous; they settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir (that is, Mount Hermon), and Mount Mizar.
13:5:24:These were the heads of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel—valiant warriors, famous men, and heads of their families.
13:5:25:But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
13:5:26:So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria), who took the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River, where they remain to this day.

13:9:18:Heman and Jeduthun were also part of this group of singers, along with their families and relatives.
13:9:19:All these Levites were appointed to specific duties in the service of the house of God, including gatekeeping, singing, and performing various tasks.
13:9:20:Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, was in charge of guarding the Ark of the Covenant and the sacred utensils.

13:9:25:Each of them had a specific area of responsibility, and they worked diligently to fulfill their obligations.
13:9:26:God blessed the Levites for their faithful service, and they continued to serve Him throughout their generations.
13:9:27:Thus, the people of Israel maintained their spiritual heritage and remained devoted to the worship of God.
13:9:28:In this way, the people of Israel preserved their faith and ensured that future generations would continue to serve God.
13:9:29:All these things were recorded in the genealogical records, so that the people of Israel would remember their heritage and remain faithful to the Lord.
13:9:30:And so, the people of Israel continued to serve God and carry out His will, as their ancestors had done before them.
13:10:1:In those days, the Philistines fought against Israel. The Israelite soldiers fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa.
13:10:2:The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons closely, ultimately killing Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
13:10:3:The battle intensified around Saul, and when the archers found him, they gravely wounded him.
13:10:4:Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that these uncircumcised Philistines won't mock and torture me." But his armor-bearer was too afraid to do it, so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
13:10:5:When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.
13:10:6:Thus, Saul and his three sons, along with his entire household, died together that day.
13:10:7:When the people of Israel who lived in the valley saw that their army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and ran away. Then the Philistines came and occupied those places.
13:10:8:On the following day, when the Philistines went to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.
13:10:9:They stripped Saul, took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people.
13:10:10:They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his skull in the temple of Dagon.
13:10:11:But when the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
13:10:12:their bravest warriors went all night, took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and returned to Jabesh. There they burned the remains,
13:10:13:and buried their bones under a tree at Jabesh. Then they fasted for seven days.
13:10:14:Saul's death came because he was unfaithful to the Lord; he did not follow the Lord's instructions and even consulted a medium for guidance,
13:10:15:instead of seeking guidance from the Lord. Therefore, the Lord put him to death and transferred the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
13:11:1:David was made king of all Israel, and they all accepted him as their ruler.
13:11:2:He had been anointed by the people and became their leader.
13:11:3:All the elders came to David at Hebron, and he made a covenant with them before the Lord. They anointed him king over Israel, just as the Lord had promised through Samuel.
13:11:4:David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which was called Jebus at that time, where the Jebusites lived.
13:11:5:The people of Jebus told David, "You'll never get in here!" But David captured the stronghold of Zion, now known as the City of David.
13:11:6:David said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become commander-in-chief." Joab, son of Zeruiah, was the first to go up, so he became the chief.
13:11:7:David settled in the stronghold, which is why it's called the City of David.
13:11:8:He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces inward.
13:11:9:David grew stronger and stronger, for the Lord Almighty was with him.
13:11:10:These are the leaders of David's mighty warriors who helped him become king over all Israel, according to the Lord's word.
13:11:11:This is the list of David's mighty warriors: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
13:11:12:Next to him was Eleazar, son of Dodai the Ahohite. He was with David when they defied the Philistines gathered for battle, and the Israelites retreated.
13:11:13:He stood his ground in the middle of a field full of barley and defended it, killing the Philistines. The Lord brought about a great victory.
13:11:14:During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
13:11:15:At that time, David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
13:11:16:David expressed his longing for water, saying, "Oh, how I wish someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
13:11:17:The three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord.
13:11:18:"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" So he would not drink it. These exploits were performed by the three mighty warriors.
13:11:19:Abishai, brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was the leader of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and won a name among the Three.
13:11:20:He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
13:11:21:Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel who performed great feats. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
13:11:22:And he killed an Egyptian, a huge man. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
13:11:23:Such were the exploits of Benaiah, son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors.
13:11:24:He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
13:11:25:Among the Thirty were Asahel, Joab's brother; Elhanan, son of Dodo from Bethlehem;
13:11:26:Shammoth the Harorite; Helez the Pelonite;
13:11:27:Ira, son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; Abiezer the Anathothite;

13:11:31:Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash; Abi-Albon the Arbathite;
13:11:32:Azmaveth the Baharumite; Eliahba the Shaalbonite;
13:11:33:Hashem the Gizonite; Jonathan, son of Shagee the Hararite;
13:11:34:Ahiam, son of Sakar the Hararite; Eliphal, son of Ur;
13:11:35:Hepher the Mecherathite; Ahijah the Pelonite;
13:11:36:Hezro the Carmelite; Naarai, son of Ezbai;
13:11:37:Joel, brother of Nathan; Mibhar, son of Hagri;
13:11:38:Zelek the Ammonite; Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab, son of Zeruiah;
13:11:39:Ira the Ithrite; Gareb the Ithrite;
13:11:40:Uriah the Hittite; Zabad, son of Ahlai;
13:11:41:Adina, son of Shiza the Reubenite, who was chief of the Reubenites and the thirty with him;
13:11:42:Hanan, son of Maakah; Joshaphat the Mithnite;
13:11:43:Uzzia the Ashterathite; Shama and Jeiel, sons of Hotham the Aroerite;
13:11:44:Jediael, son of Shimri; Joha his brother, the Tizite;
13:11:45:Eliel the Mahavite; Jeribai and Joshaviah, sons of Elnaam; Ithmah the Moabite;
13:11:46:Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
13:12:1:During the time when David was hiding from Saul, some brave warriors came to join him and his band of followers.
13:12:2:Among them were members of the tribe of Benjamin, who were skilled archers and could shoot arrows and sling stones with great accuracy, using both their left and right hands.
13:12:3:Their leader was Ahiezer, and his second-in-command was Joash. They were both sons of Shemaah from Gibeah. Other notable warriors included Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu from Anathoth,
13:12:4:Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the Thirty and leader over them; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
13:12:5:Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
13:12:6:Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;
13:12:7:And Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
13:12:8:Some Gadites also joined David at his stronghold in the wilderness. They were valiant warriors, trained for battle, and expert with shields and spears. Their faces were like lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
13:12:9:Ezer was their chief, followed by Obadiah, Eliab,
13:12:10:Mishmannah, Jeremiah, Attai,
13:12:11:Eliel, Johanan, Elzabad,
13:12:12:Jeremiah, and Macbannai. These Gadites were army commanders, with the least of them a match for a hundred men and the greatest for a thousand.
13:12:13:These are the men who crossed the Jordan River during its flood season and chased away all those living in the valleys, both to the east and west.
13:12:14:Some from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah also came to David at his stronghold.
13:12:15:David went out to meet them and said, "If you have come in peace to help me, I welcome you. Join me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I haven't done any wrong, may the God of our ancestors see it and judge."
13:12:16:Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the Thirty, and he said, "We are yours, David! We are with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God helps you." So David welcomed them and made them leaders of his troops.
13:12:17:Some Manassites also joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. They didn't actually help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent David away. They said, "At the risk of our heads, he will go back to his master Saul."
13:12:18:When David went to Ziklag, these Manassite warriors joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh.
13:12:19:They helped David against raiding bands, for they were all mighty warriors and commanders in the army.
13:12:20:Day by day, more men came to help David until he had a great army, like the army of God.
13:12:21:The following is a list of the men who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, as the Lord had instructed:
13:12:22:From the tribe of Judah, carrying shields and spears, 6,800 armed warriors were ready for battle.
13:12:23:From the tribe of Simeon, 7,100 mighty warriors were prepared for combat.
13:12:24:From the tribe of Levi, 4,600 men joined David,
13:12:25:including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
13:12:26:and Zadok, a young warrior, with 22 commanders from his own family.
13:12:27:From the tribe of Benjamin, Saul's relatives, 3,000 men. Most of them had remained loyal to Saul's house until then.
13:12:28:From the tribe of Ephraim, 20,800 brave warriors, famous in their families.
13:12:29:From the half-tribe of Manasseh west of the Jordan, 18,000 men were designated by name to come and make David king.
13:12:30:From the tribe of Issachar, 200 leaders who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, along with all their relatives under their command.
13:12:31:From the tribe of Zebulun, 50,000 experienced warriors, ready for battle with every kind of weapon, who were united in their loyalty to David.
13:12:32:From the tribe of Naphtali, 1,000 officers accompanied by 37,000 men carrying shields and spears.
13:12:33:From the tribe of Dan, 28,600 men prepared for battle.
13:12:34:From the tribe of Asher, 40,000 experienced warriors ready for combat.
13:12:35:From the east side of the Jordan River, where the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived, 120,000 men armed with various weapons for battle.
13:12:36:All these soldiers, skilled in warfare, came to Hebron with a single purpose: to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites also supported David, wholeheartedly agreeing that he should be their king.
13:12:37:For three days, they feasted and celebrated with David, as their families had provided abundant supplies of food and drink.
13:12:38:From as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, people brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—vast amounts of flour, fig cakes, raisin clusters, wine, olive oil, cattle, and sheep. There was great joy throughout Israel.
13:13:1:David consulted with the leaders of thousands and hundreds, as well as with every commander.
13:13:2:He said to the entire assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you and if it's the will of the Lord our God, let's send a message far and wide to our fellow Israelites who remain in all the regions of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in their towns and pasturelands, so they may join us.
13:13:3:Let's bring back the Ark of our God, for we haven't sought it during the reign of Saul."
13:13:4:The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.
13:13:5:So David assembled all Israel, from Egypt's Shihor River to Lebo-hamath, to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
13:13:6:David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the Ark of God the Lord, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the Ark that is called by the Name.
13:13:7:They transported the Ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, with Uzza and Ahio guiding the cart.
13:13:8:David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, singing songs and playing various musical instruments—lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
13:13:9:When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzza reached out his hand to steady the Ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
13:13:10:The Lord's anger burned against Uzza, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the Ark. Uzza died there before God.
13:13:11:David was angry because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzza, and that place has been called Perez-uzza to this day.
13:13:12:Fearful of God that day, David asked, "How can I ever bring the Ark of God to me?"
13:13:13:He decided not to take the Ark to the City of David; instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
13:13:14:The Ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and the Lord blessed his household and everything he had.
13:14:1:Now Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David along with cedar trees, stonecutters, and carpenters to build a palace for him.
13:14:2:David realized that the Lord had truly established him as king over Israel and had blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
13:14:3:In Jerusalem, David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.
13:14:4:These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
13:14:5:Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
13:14:6:Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
13:14:7:Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
13:14:8:When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him; but David heard about it and went out to confront them.
13:14:9:Now the Philistines had invaded and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
13:14:10:David inquired of God, asking, "Should I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The Lord answered him, "Go, I will hand them over to you."
13:14:11:So David and his men went up to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines. He said, "God has broken through my enemies like a flood." That is why the place was called Baal-perazim.
13:14:12:The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
13:14:13:Once again the Philistines raided the valley.
13:14:14:So David inquired of God again, and God answered him, "Do not go directly after them; instead, circle around them and attack them from the front of the balsam trees.
13:14:15:As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army."
13:14:16:David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
13:14:17:The fame of David spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the nations fear him.
13:15:1:David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the Ark of God, setting up a tent for it.
13:15:2:Then David said, "No one should carry the Ark of God except the Levites, for the Lord has chosen them to carry the Ark of the Lord and to serve Him forever."
13:15:3:So David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it.
13:15:4:David assembled the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
13:15:5:From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives;
13:15:6:From the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;
13:15:7:From the Gershonites, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;
13:15:8:From the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;
13:15:9:From the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;
13:15:10:From the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.
13:15:11:David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
13:15:12:He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
13:15:13:Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God broke out against us, since we did not seek Him according to the proper order."
13:15:14:So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.
13:15:15:The Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord.
13:15:16:David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers, to play musical instruments such as harps, lyres, and cymbals, and to raise their voices in joyful praise.
13:15:17:So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel, Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the sons of Merari.
13:15:18:With them were their relatives next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
13:15:19:The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound bronze cymbals;
13:15:20:Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
13:15:21:Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
13:15:22:Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was skillful.
13:15:23:Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the Ark.
13:15:24:Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the Ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be gatekeepers for the Ark.
13:15:25:So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
13:15:26:Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
13:15:27:David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the Ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the music director. David also wore a linen ephod.
13:15:28:So all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouts, the sound of the horn, trumpets, cymbals, and the playing of harps and lyres.
13:15:29:As the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord entered the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. When she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
13:16:1:On that day, David first assigned Asaph and his fellow musicians to give thanks to the Lord.
13:16:2:Give thanks to the Lord, call on His name; make known His deeds among the peoples.
13:16:3:Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wondrous works.
13:16:4:Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
13:16:5:Seek the Lord and His strength; always search for His presence.
13:16:6:Remember the wonders He has done, His miracles, and the judgments He pronounced,
13:16:7:O descendants of Israel, His servant, children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
13:16:8:He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
13:16:9:Remember His covenant forever, the word He commanded for a thousand generations,
13:16:10:The covenant He made with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac,
13:16:11:Which He confirmed to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
13:16:12:Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."
13:16:13:When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
13:16:14:They wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
13:16:15:He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake He rebuked kings:
13:16:16:"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
13:16:17:Sing to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim His salvation day after day.
13:16:18:Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
13:16:19:For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; He is to be feared above all gods.
13:16:20:For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
13:16:21:Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy are in His dwelling place.
13:16:22:Ascribe to the Lord, O families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
13:16:23:Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness.
13:16:24:Tremble before Him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
13:16:25:Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, "The Lord reigns!"
13:16:26:Let the sea resound, and all that is in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!
13:16:27:Then the trees of the forest will sing, they will sing for joy before the Lord, for He comes to judge the earth.
13:16:28:Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever.
13:16:29:Cry out, "Save us, God our Savior; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, and glory in Your praise."
13:16:30:Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said "Amen" and praised the Lord.
13:16:31:David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister there regularly, according to each day's requirements.
13:16:32:He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.
13:16:33:David, together with Zadok the priest and his fellow priests, went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing.
13:16:34:And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
13:16:35:David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the singers, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.
13:16:36:So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouts, with the sounding of rams' horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.
13:16:37:As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
13:17:1:After David had settled into his palace, he told the prophet Nathan, "Look, I live in a beautiful house made of cedar, but the Ark of God's Covenant remains in a tent."
13:17:2:Nathan replied to David, "Do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you."
13:17:3:But that night, God spoke to Nathan, saying,
13:17:4:"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the Lord says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.
13:17:5:I haven't lived in a house since the day I brought Israel out of Egypt; I've been moving around in a tent as my dwelling place.
13:17:6:Throughout my time with Israel, did I ever ask any of the judges whom I appointed to shepherd my people, "Why haven't you built me a house of cedar?"'
13:17:7:Now then, tell my servant David this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'I took you from tending sheep in the fields to become ruler over my people Israel.
13:17:8:I've been with you wherever you've gone, and I've defeated all your enemies before you. Now, I will make your name great, like those of the most famous people on earth.
13:17:9:I will establish a place for my people Israel and plant them securely, so they can live in peace. They will no longer be disturbed by wicked people, as they were before
13:17:10:and have been since the time I appointed judges over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore, I declare to you that the Lord will build a house for you.
13:17:11:When your days are complete and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants to succeed you, someone from your own family line. I will establish his kingdom.
13:17:12:He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will secure his throne forever.
13:17:13:I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I did with your predecessor.
13:17:14:I will establish his kingdom forever, and his throne will last as long as the heavens.
13:17:15:But if he disobeys my commands and regulations, I will punish him with the rod of men and the blows inflicted by human beings.
13:17:16:However, my love will never be removed from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
13:17:17:Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'"
13:17:18:Then Nathan relayed all these words and the entire vision to David.
13:17:19:King David went in, sat before the Lord, and said, "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
13:17:20:And now, God, in addition to everything else, you speak of your servant's future and promise a lasting dynasty. You see me as a man of high rank, Lord God.
13:17:21:What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,
13:17:22:Lord. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done all these great things and revealed all these great promises.
13:17:23:There is no one like you, Lord, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
13:17:24:And who is like your people Israel—a nation on earth that God went to redeem as his own people, making a name for yourself and performing great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
13:17:25:You made Israel your very own forever, and you, Lord, became their God.
13:17:26:Now, Lord, let the promise you made concerning your servant and his house be confirmed forever. Do as you promised,
13:17:27:so that it will be established and your name will be exalted forever, when people say, 'The Lord Almighty is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.
13:17:28:You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.
13:17:29:Lord, you are God! You have promised all these good things to your servant.
13:17:30:Now, please bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever in your presence. For you, Lord, have spoken, and with your blessing, the house of your servant will be blessed forever."
13:18:1:After this, David defeated the Philistines, completely subduing them. He took control of Gath and its surrounding villages.
13:18:2:He also conquered Moab, forcing them to become his subjects and pay tribute.
13:18:3:David then went on to defeat Hadadezer, king of Zobah, near Hamath, as he tried to extend his territory along the Euphrates River.
13:18:4:From Hadadezer's army, David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He disabled all but 100 of the chariots by cutting their horses' hamstrings.
13:18:5:When the Arameans from Damascus came to help King Hadadezer, David struck down 22,000 of their men.
13:18:6:David stationed troops in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, making the Arameans his subjects and requiring them to pay tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
13:18:7:David took the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
13:18:8:From Tibhath and Cun, cities belonging to Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze which Solomon later used to make the bronze Sea, pillars, and various bronze articles.
13:18:9:When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
13:18:10:he sent his son Hadoram to congratulate King David and to bless him for defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought with him various articles made of gold, silver, and bronze.
13:18:11:King David dedicated these articles, along with the silver and gold he had taken from other nations—Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek—to the Lord.
13:18:12:Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13:18:13:He stationed troops in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's subjects. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
13:19:1:Now, after this, Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, died and his son succeeded him as king.
13:19:2:David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun, Nahash's son, because his father was kind to me." So David sent messengers to comfort Hanun concerning his father's death.
13:19:3:However, the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, "Do you really think David is honoring your father by sending these comforters to you? Haven't his envoys come to spy on you, explore the land, and overthrow it?"
13:19:4:So Hanun took David's servants, shaved them, cut their garments in half up to their buttocks, and sent them away.
13:19:5:When David heard about this, he sent someone to meet them, since they were greatly humiliated. The king told them, "Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return."
13:19:6:Seeing that they had angered David, the Ammonites hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as a thousand men from the king of Maacah and 12,000 men from Tob.
13:19:7:Upon hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty warriors.
13:19:8:The Ammonites marched out and formed a battle line at the entrance of their city gate, while the kings who had come to help were in the field by themselves.
13:19:9:Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him, so he chose some of Israel's best troops and deployed them against the Arameans.
13:19:10:He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who positioned them to face the Ammonites.
13:19:11:Joab said, "If the Arameans prove too strong for me, you must come to my rescue. But if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will save you.
13:19:12:Be strong and courageous! Let's fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God, and may the LORD's will be done."
13:19:13:Joab and his troops advanced to battle against the Arameans, who fled before him.
13:19:14:When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they also fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. So Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
13:19:15:Seeing their defeat by Israel, the Arameans sent messengers and summoned additional Aramean forces beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, leading them.
13:19:16:When David was informed about this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and confronted them. He formed a battle line against the Arameans, who fought against him.
13:19:17:But the Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed 7,000 of their charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, the commander of their army.
13:19:18:The Arameans, now subdued, became subjects of David and brought tribute. The LORD gave victory to David wherever he went.
13:20:1:During springtime, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the army and devastated the Ammonites' land. He besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and destroyed it.
13:20:2:David took the crown from their king's head, which weighed about seventy-five pounds and was set with precious stones. He placed it on his own head. Additionally, he seized a vast amount of plunder from the city.
13:20:3:He brought out the people who were in the city, put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes, and made them labor at brickmaking. This is what he did to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.
13:20:4:Later on, war broke out again with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time, Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
13:20:5:In another battle against the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like a weaver's beam.
13:20:6:There was also a battle at Gath, where there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in total. He too was a descendant of the giants.
13:20:7:When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimea, killed him.
13:20:8:These giants were descendants of the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hands of David and his soldiers.
13:21:1:One day, Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of the people of Israel.
13:21:2:So King David instructed Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go count the people of Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and report back to me with the total number."
13:21:3:Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his people a hundred times over! But why does my lord the king want to do this? Aren't they all your servants? Why should you bring guilt upon Israel?"
13:21:4:Nevertheless, the king's order prevailed over Joab's objections. So Joab left and went throughout Israel to conduct the census, then returned to Jerusalem.
13:21:5:Joab reported the results of the census to David: there were 1,100,000 fighting men in Israel and 470,000 in Judah.
13:21:6:But Joab did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the count because he was disgusted with the king's command.
13:21:7:God was displeased with the census and punished Israel for it.
13:21:8:David prayed to God, "I have committed a great sin by conducting this census. Please forgive me, LORD, for I have acted foolishly."
13:21:9:The LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
13:21:10:"Go tell David that this is what the LORD says: 'I am offering you three choices. Choose one, and I will carry it out against you.'"
13:21:11:Gad went to David and told him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Choose between these three options:
13:21:12:Three years of famine, three months of being defeated by your enemies, or three days of severe plague throughout your land. Now decide what answer I should give to the LORD who sent me.'"
13:21:13:David replied, "I am in great distress! But let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great. Do not let me fall into human hands."
13:21:14:So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 people died.
13:21:15:As the angel was about to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD saw the destruction and relented. He said to the angel who was causing the devastation, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13:21:16:When David saw the angel striking down the people, he prayed, "LORD, I am the one who sinned and acted wickedly. These sheep, what have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family instead."
13:21:17:Gad came to David that day and said, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
13:21:18:So David went up as Gad had instructed him, following the LORD's command.
13:21:19:When Ornan saw the king and his servants approaching, he left his threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.
13:21:20:David said to Ornan, "Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price, so I can build an altar to the LORD here, and the plague will be stopped."
13:21:21:Ornan replied, "Take it, my lord the king, and do whatever you wish. I will provide the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I give it all to you."
13:21:22:But King David insisted, "No, I will pay you the full price. I won't take what belongs to you and offer it to the LORD without paying for it."
13:21:23:So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold for the site.
13:21:24:David built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called on the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
13:21:25:Then the LORD commanded the angel to put his sword back into its sheath.
13:21:26:At that time, David realized that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, so he continued to offer sacrifices there.
13:21:27:However, the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at the high place in Gibeon.
13:21:28:David couldn't go to the altar at Gibeon to seek God, for he was afraid of the angel's sword that he had seen at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13:21:29:So David decided to build a temple for the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite and prepared everything necessary for its construction.
13:22:1:David said, "This is the place where the house of God will be built, the temple for the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD."
13:22:2:So David commanded to gather the foreigners living in Israel, and he appointed them as stonecutters to shape stones for building the house of God.
13:22:3:He also prepared an abundant supply of iron for nails to fasten the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in immeasurable amounts.
13:22:4:Furthermore, he provided cedar logs without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought vast quantities of cedar timber to David.
13:22:5:David thought, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, famous, and glorious throughout all nations. I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death.
13:22:6:Then he called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
13:22:7:David said to Solomon, "My son, I had intended to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God.
13:22:8:But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood and waged great wars; you shall not build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the earth before Me.
13:22:9:Behold, a son will be born to you who shall be a man of rest; I will give him rest from all his enemies around him. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant peace and quietness to Israel during his reign.
13:22:10:He will build a house for My Name, and he will be My son, and I will be his Father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
13:22:11:Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He has spoken concerning you.
13:22:12:Only, may the LORD grant you wisdom and understanding, that you may obey the Law of the LORD your God as you rule over Israel.
13:22:13:For then you will prosper if you carefully follow the statutes and judgments that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or discouraged.
13:22:14:Now behold, I have made every effort to provide what is needed for the house of the LORD: 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them.
13:22:15:Moreover, you have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work
13:22:16:in gold, silver, bronze, and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you."
13:22:17:Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
13:22:18:He said to them, "Is not the LORD your God with you? Has He not given you rest on every side? For He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and His people.
13:22:19:Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you can bring the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the house built for the Name of the LORD."
13:23:1:David, now old and full of years, made his son Solomon king over Israel.
13:23:2:He gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and the Levites.
13:23:3:The Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and their total number was 38,000.
13:23:4:David said, "Out of these, 24,000 will be responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the Lord, while 6,000 will serve as officials and judges.
13:23:5:4,000 will be gatekeepers, and another 4,000 will praise the Lord with musical instruments that I have provided."
13:23:6:David organized the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
13:23:7:Among the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei.
13:23:8:The sons of Ladan were Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel—three in total.
13:23:9:The sons of Shimei were Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran—also three in total.
13:23:10:These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
13:23:11:And the sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
13:23:12:Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.
13:23:13:The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in total.
13:23:14:The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister to him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.
13:23:15:The sons of Moses, the man of God, were counted among the tribe of Levi.
13:23:16:The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
13:23:17:The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel, who was the first.
13:23:18:Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, the head of the family; but though Eliezer had few sons, they became a numerous clan.
13:23:19:The sons of Izhar were Shelomith, the first.
13:23:20:The sons of Hebron were Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam.
13:23:21:The sons of Uzziel were Micah, the first, and Isshiah, the second.
13:23:22:The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
13:23:23:Eleazar died without having sons, only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
13:23:24:The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth—three in total.
13:23:25:These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the house of the Lord.
13:23:26:For David had said, "Since the Lord, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,
13:23:27:the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service."
13:23:28:According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
13:23:29:The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the house of the Lord: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.
13:23:30:They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
13:23:31:They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord. They were to do the same in the evening
13:23:32:and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the Lord on Sabbaths, at New Moon feasts and at appointed festivals. They were to serve before the Lord regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.
13:23:33:And so, the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place, and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the house of the Lord.
13:24:1:In the time of David, the descendants of Aaron were divided into 24 groups for serving in the temple. These groups were led by the sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
13:24:2:However, Nadab and Abihu died before their father, leaving no children. So, only Eleazar and Ithamar were left to carry on as priests.
13:24:3:David, along with Zadok from the family of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the family of Ithamar, organized these remaining descendants of Aaron into their respective groups for service.
13:24:4:There were more leaders among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, so they divided them accordingly: sixteen groups from Eleazar's family and eight groups from Ithamar's family.
13:24:5:They assigned these groups by lot, treating them equally, for there were officials of the sanctuary and leaders of God's house from both Eleazar's and Ithamar's families.
13:24:6:The scribe Shemaiah, son of Nethanel from the tribe of Levi, recorded the names of the leaders of each group in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families for the priests and Levites. They drew lots for each family, one after the other.
13:24:7:The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
13:24:8:the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
13:24:9:the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
13:24:10:the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
13:24:11:the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
13:24:12:the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
13:24:13:the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
13:24:14:the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
13:24:15:the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
13:24:16:the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
13:24:17:the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
13:24:18:the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
13:24:19:These were the assigned orders of service for the priests when they entered the house of the Lord, according to the regulations given to them by their ancestor Aaron, as commanded by the Lord, the God of Israel.
13:25:1:In the time of David, the leaders of the Levites were assigned to be in charge of the music in the Lord's temple. They sang hymns and played various musical instruments.
13:25:2:The sons of Asaph were under his direction; Asaph was a prophet who prophesied under the guidance of the king.
13:25:3:Jeduthun had six sons who were under his supervision: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. They all played their musical instruments to praise the Lord, following Jeduthun's instructions.
13:25:4:Heman, the king's seer, had fourteen sons and three daughters. They were all under Heman's guidance, as he taught them how to sing and play instruments in the house of the Lord.
13:25:5:All these musicians were under the supervision of their fathers, who led the music at the Lord's temple. They played cymbals, harps, and lyres during the worship services and when offering burnt sacrifices.
13:25:6:These skilled musicians were under the authority of their fathers, and they all served the Lord with one accord, following the directions given by the king.
13:25:7:The total number of these musicians, including their relatives who were trained and skilled in singing praises to the Lord, was 288.
13:25:8:They cast lots to determine their responsibilities, without regard for their age or rank, so that each person would have an equal chance to serve.
13:25:9:The first lot fell to Joseph from the family of Asaph, along with his twelve sons and brothers. The second lot went to Gedaliah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:10:The third lot was for Zaccur and his twelve sons and brothers. The fourth lot was assigned to Izri and his twelve relatives.
13:25:11:The fifth lot went to Nethaniah and his twelve sons and brothers. The sixth lot was for Bukkiah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:12:The seventh lot fell to Jesarelah and his twelve sons and brothers. The eighth lot went to Jeshaiah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:13:The ninth lot was for Mattaniah and his twelve sons and brothers. The tenth lot was assigned to Shimei and his twelve relatives.
13:25:14:The eleventh lot went to Azarel and his twelve sons and brothers. The twelfth lot was for Hashabiah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:15:The thirteenth lot fell to Shubael and his twelve sons and brothers. The fourteenth lot went to Mattithiah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:16:The fifteenth lot was for Jeremoth and his twelve sons and brothers. The sixteenth lot was assigned to Hananiah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:17:The seventeenth lot went to Joshbekashah and his twelve sons and brothers. The eighteenth lot was for Hanani and his twelve relatives.
13:25:18:The nineteenth lot fell to Mallothi and his twelve sons and brothers. The twentieth lot went to Eliathah and his twelve relatives.
13:25:19:The twenty-first lot was for Hothir and his twelve sons and brothers. The twenty-second lot was assigned to Giddalti and his twelve relatives.
13:25:20:The twenty-third lot went to Mahazioth and his twelve sons and brothers. The twenty-fourth lot was for Romamti-Ezer and his twelve relatives.
13:26:1:In that time, the divisions of the gatekeepers were organized. These were the descendants of Korah and Merari.
13:26:2:The leader among the sons of Korah was Meshelemiah, who was the son of Kore, from the family of Asaph.
13:26:3:Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah, the firstborn; Jediael, the second; Zebadiah, the third; Jathniel, the fourth;
13:26:4:Elam, the fifth; Jehohanan, the sixth; and Eliehoenai, the seventh.
13:26:5:Obed-edom also had sons: Shemaiah, the firstborn; Jehozabad, the second; Joah, the third; Sacar, the fourth; Nethanel, the fifth;
13:26:6:Ammiel, the sixth; Issachar, the seventh; and Peullethai, the eighth. God had indeed blessed him.
13:26:7:Shemaiah's sons and relatives were capable men who were leaders in their families.
13:26:8:All these were descendants of Obed-edom, with their sons and brothers, 62 capable men in total, all skilled in their duties as gatekeepers.
13:26:9:Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, 18 capable men in total.
13:26:10:Hosah, from the Merari family, had sons: Shimri, the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father made him the leader);
13:26:11:Hilkiah, the second; Tebaliah, the third; and Zechariah, the fourth. In total, Hosah had 13 sons and brothers.
13:26:12:Among these divisions of gatekeepers, the leaders were responsible for guarding the temple, just as their relatives had been.
13:26:13:They cast lots for each gate, both young and old, according to their families.
13:26:14:The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and the lot for the north gate came out for him.
13:26:15:The lot for the south gate went to Obed-edom, and the lot for the storehouse went to his sons.
13:26:16:The lots for the west gate and the Shallecheth gate on the ascending highway went to Shuppim and Hosah. Guard was stationed opposite guard:
13:26:17:six Levites were assigned each day to the east gate, four to the north gate, four to the south gate, and two at a time to the storehouse.
13:26:18:For the court on the west side, there were four at the highway and two at the court itself.
13:26:19:These were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the descendants of Korah and Merari.
13:27:1:In the twenty-seventh chapter of the First Book of Chronicles, we learn about the military divisions, tribal leaders, and overseers of King David's kingdom.
13:27:2:There were twelve divisions of 24,000 soldiers each, serving under their respective commanders for one month per year.
13:27:3:Jashobeam, son of Zabdiel, was the leader of the first division for the first month, commanding 24,000 soldiers.
13:27:4:Dodai the Ahohite led the second division for the second month, also with 24,000 troops under his command.
13:27:5:The third division's commander for the third month was Benaiah, son of Jehoiada the priest, who was a valiant warrior and had 24,000 soldiers in his charge.
13:27:6:Benaiah's deputy was Ammizabad, his son, who supported him in his duties.
13:27:7:Asahel, brother of Joab, commanded the fourth division during the fourth month, and his successor was his son Zebadiah; they too had 24,000 soldiers.
13:27:8:Shamhuth the Izrahite led the fifth division for the fifth month, with 24,000 soldiers under his authority.
13:27:9:Ira, son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, was responsible for the sixth division in the sixth month, commanding another 24,000 troops.
13:27:10:Helez the Pelonite, an Ephraimite, oversaw the seventh division for the seventh month, with 24,000 soldiers in his division.
13:27:11:Sibbekai the Hushathite, from the tribe of Zerah, led the eighth division during the eighth month, commanding 24,000 soldiers.
13:27:12:Abiezer from Anathoth, a Benjaminite, was in charge of the ninth division for the ninth month, with 24,000 troops under his leadership.
13:27:13:Maharai the Netophathite, from the tribe of Zerah, commanded the tenth division in the tenth month, leading 24,000 soldiers.
13:27:14:Benaiah the Pirathonite, an Ephraimite, led the eleventh division for the eleventh month, with another 24,000 troops in his charge.
13:27:15:Heldai the Netophathite, from the family of Othniel, was responsible for the twelfth division during the twelfth month, commanding 24,000 soldiers.
13:27:16:Additionally, there were tribal leaders for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
13:27:17:Eliuzur, son of Zikri, was the leader of the tribe of Reuben.
13:27:18:Shephatiah, son of Maacah, was in charge of the tribe of Simeon.
13:27:19:Hashabiah, son of Kemuel, led the tribe of Levi.
13:27:20:Zadok was the leader for the tribe of Judah.
13:27:21:Mikloth, son of Hushai, was responsible for the tribe of Issachar.
13:27:22:Jeremoth, son of Azriel, led the tribe of Zebulun.
13:27:23:Ishmaiah, son of Obadiah, was in charge of the tribe of Naphtali.
13:27:24:Jerimoth, son of Azaz, was responsible for the tribe of Ephraim.
13:27:25:Hoshea, son of Azaziah, led the tribe of Manasseh in Gilead.
13:27:26:Joel, son of Pedaiah, was in charge of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead.
13:27:27:Iddo, son of Zechariah, was responsible for the tribe of Benjamin.
13:27:28:Jaasiel, son of Abner, led the tribe of Dan.
13:27:29:Furthermore, King David appointed overseers for various aspects of his kingdom. 
13:27:30:Ahilud's sons, Jehoshaphat and Jonathan, were in charge of recording the king's affairs and overseeing the land, respectively.
13:27:31:Sheva was the royal secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar served as priests.
13:27:32:Ira the Jairite was also a priest and served as one of David's personal advisors.
13:28:1:David gathered all the leaders of Israel to Jerusalem, including the officers over the tribes, the commanders of the divisions in the service of the king, the captains of thousands and hundreds, and the stewards over all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, along with the palace officials, the mighty men, and all the valiant warriors.
13:28:2:Then King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my fellow Israelites, and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD and as a footstool for our God, but he told me that I could not do it.
13:28:3:God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name because you have been a warrior and have shed blood.'
13:28:4:However, the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from my entire family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah, he selected my father's family. Among my father's sons, he was pleased with me and made me king over all Israel.
13:28:5:And from all my sons—for the LORD has given me many sons—he has chosen Solomon, my son, to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
13:28:6:He said to me, 'Your son Solomon will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
13:28:7:I will establish his kingdom forever if he remains committed to carrying out my commandments and ordinances, as he is today.'
13:28:8:So now, in the presence of all the assembly of the LORD and in the hearing of our God, I urge you to keep and seek all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance for your descendants forever.
13:28:9:As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every intention of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever.
13:28:10:Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it."
13:28:11:Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the vestibule, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner rooms, and the place for the mercy seat.
13:28:12:He provided him with the plans for everything he had in mind: the courts of the house of the LORD, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts.
13:28:13:David also gave instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for all the work of the service in the house of the LORD, and for all the articles used in the service of the house of God.
13:28:14:He designated the weight of gold for all the golden articles for every kind of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles for every kind of service.
13:28:15:The weight of gold was set for the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service.
13:28:16:The weight of gold was assigned for the tables of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the silver tables.
13:28:17:He designated the weight of pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups, and for the golden bowls with their weight for each bowl, and for the silver bowls with their weight for each bowl.
13:28:18:And he designated the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense. David also gave Solomon the plan for the chariot—the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and sheltered the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD.
13:28:19:"All this," said David, "I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me the details of all these plans."
13:28:20:David encouraged Solomon his son, saying, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
13:28:21:Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites are ready for all the work on the house of God, and every willing person skilled in any craft will assist you in all the work. Also, the officials and all the people will be at your command."
13:29:1:So, King David addressed the entire assembly, saying, "God has chosen Solomon, my son, who is still young and inexperienced, to build a temple as his palace. But the task is great because this palace isn't for humans; it's for the LORD God.
13:29:2:Now, I have done my best to prepare for the temple of my God by providing gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, onyx, stones, and all kinds of precious gems, as well as marble slabs in abundance.
13:29:3:Moreover, because of my love for the house of my God, I am giving my personal treasure of gold and silver to the temple, in addition to everything else I have prepared for the holy temple:
13:29:4:three thousand talents of gold from Ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,
13:29:5:for the gold and silver work, and for every kind of artistic craftsmanship. Now, who else is willing to contribute generously to the LORD today?"
13:29:6:Then the leaders of the families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials responsible for the king's work offered willingly.
13:29:7:They donated to the construction of the temple five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
13:29:8:And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple, which was under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
13:29:9:The people rejoiced at their willingness to give, for they had offered freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. And King David was also filled with joy.
13:29:10:David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Blessed are you, LORD, the God of our ancestor Israel, forever and ever.
13:29:11:Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. Everything in heaven and on earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head over all.
13:29:12:Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
13:29:13:Now, our God, we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.
13:29:14:But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give so generously? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
13:29:15:We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
13:29:16:LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.
13:29:17:I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have willingly given, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, giving joyfully and willingly to you.
13:29:18:O LORD, the God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.
13:29:19:And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements, and decrees, and to build the palace for which I have made provision."
13:29:20:Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So they all praised the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and bowed down, prostrating themselves before the LORD and the king.
13:29:21:The next day, they offered sacrifices and presented burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
13:29:22:They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon as king for the second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.
13:29:23:So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
13:29:24:All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David's sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.
13:29:25:And the LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, bestowing on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.
13:29:26:David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel.
13:29:27:He reigned over Israel for forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
13:29:28:He died at a ripe old age, full of days, riches, and honor. And his son Solomon succeeded him as king.
13:29:29:As for the events of King David's reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet, and the records of Gad the seer,
13:29:30:together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.
