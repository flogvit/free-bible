45:1:1:From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God,
45:1:2:God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures.
45:1:3:The Good News is about his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born as a human descendant of King David.
45:1:4:Jesus was shown to be the Son of God with power when he was raised from the dead by the Holy Spirit. He is Jesus Christ our Lord.
45:1:5:Through him, we received grace and apostleship to call people from all nations to the obedience that comes from faith, for his name's sake.
45:1:6:You are also among those called to belong to Jesus Christ.
45:1:7:To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45:1:8:First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being talked about all over the world.
45:1:9:God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you
45:1:10:in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last, by God's will, the way may be opened for me to come to you.
45:1:11:I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—
45:1:12:that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.
45:1:13:I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I have often planned to come to you (but have been prevented until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
45:1:14:I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
45:1:15:That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
45:1:16:I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
45:1:17:For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that comes from faith and leads to faith—as it is written, "The righteous will live by faith."
45:1:18:The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
45:1:19:since what may be known about God is plain to them because God has made it plain to them.
45:1:20:From the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
45:1:21:For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
45:1:22:Claiming to be wise, they became fools
45:1:23:and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal humans, birds, animals, and reptiles.
45:1:24:So God gave them over to the sinful desires of their hearts, to sexual impurity, for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
45:1:25:They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator, who is forever praised. Amen.
45:1:26:Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
45:1:27:In the same way, men abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
45:1:28:Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.
45:1:29:They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,
45:1:30:slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
45:1:31:They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and ruthless.
45:1:32:Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
45:2:1:So, if you think you can judge others, consider this—you're not exempt from judgment yourself. When you pass judgment on someone else, you're really condemning yourself, because you who judge do the same things.
45:2:2:We know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
45:2:3:When you judge others and yet do the same things, do you think you'll escape God's judgment?
45:2:4:Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that it's His kindness that leads you toward repentance?
45:2:5:By being stubborn and unrepentant, you're only storing up wrath for yourself on the day of God's righteous judgment.
45:2:6:He will repay everyone according to their deeds:
45:2:7:To those who persist in doing good, seeking glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.
45:2:8:But for those who are self-seeking and reject the truth, following wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.
45:2:9:Trouble and distress will come upon every human being who does evil—first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
45:2:10:But glory, honor, and peace will be given to everyone who does good—first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
45:2:11:For God does not show favoritism.
45:2:12:All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
45:2:13:It's not enough just to hear the law; true righteousness comes from actually obeying it.
45:2:14:When Gentiles, who don't have the law, instinctively do what it requires, they show that the law's requirements are written on their hearts.
45:2:15:Their conscience bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts either accuse or excuse them.
45:2:16:This will take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
45:2:17:Now, if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God,
45:2:18:And if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you're instructed by the law,
45:2:19:And if you're convinced that you're a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,
45:2:20:An instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of infants, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,
45:2:21:You who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
45:2:22:You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?
45:2:23:You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45:2:24:As it is written, "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
45:2:25:Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
45:2:26:So if an uncircumcised man keeps the law's requirements, won't his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
45:2:27:The one who is not physically circumcised but obeys the law will condemn you who, despite having the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
45:2:28:A person is not a true Jew if they're only one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.
45:2:29:No, a true Jew is one inwardly; and true circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise comes not from others, but from God.
45:3:1:What advantage, then, do the Jews have? Or what is the value of circumcision?
45:3:2:Much in every way! Primarily, they were entrusted with the words of God.
45:3:3:But what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify God's faithfulness?
45:3:4:Absolutely not! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge."
45:3:5:However, if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, what can we say? Is God unjust to inflict wrath? (I'm speaking from a human perspective.)
45:3:6:Of course not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
45:3:7:Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"
45:3:8:Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is just!
45:3:9:What then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.
45:3:10:As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one;
45:3:11:no one understands, no one seeks God.
45:3:12:All have turned away, together they have become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."
45:3:13:"Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit." "The venom of vipers is on their lips."
45:3:14:"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
45:3:15:"Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45:3:16:ruin and misery mark their ways,
45:3:17:and the way of peace they do not know."
45:3:18:"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45:3:19:Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
45:3:20:Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
45:3:21:But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets.
45:3:22:This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
45:3:23:for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45:3:24:and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
45:3:25:God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness because, in his forbearance, he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
45:3:26:he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
45:3:27:Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
45:3:28:For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
45:3:29:Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
45:3:30:since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
45:3:31:Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
45:4:1:Now, let's consider what we can learn from the example of our forefather Abraham.
45:4:2:If Abraham had earned his righteousness through his actions, he would have reason to boast. However, this is not the case before God.
45:4:3:For the Scriptures say, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
45:4:4:Now, when someone works, their wages are not considered a gift but rather an obligation.
45:4:5:However, for those who do not rely on their own actions but trust in God, who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.
45:4:6:David also speaks about the blessing that comes upon those whom God credits with righteousness apart from their actions:
45:4:7:"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
45:4:8:Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will not count their sin."
45:4:9:Now, does this blessedness apply only to the circumcised, or does it also include the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.
45:4:10:Under which circumstances was it credited? Was it after or before he was circumcised? It was not after, but before!
45:4:11:And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while still uncircumcised. This happened so he could be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, and they too could have righteousness credited to them.
45:4:12:Additionally, Abraham is the father of the circumcised who not only bear the mark but also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45:4:13:For the promise to Abraham and his descendants that they would inherit the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
45:4:14:If those who are of the law become heirs, then faith is empty and the promise is nullified.
45:4:15:Because the law brings about wrath, and where there is no law, there is no transgression.
45:4:16:Therefore, the promise depends on faith, so it may be given as a gift and be guaranteed to all of Abraham's descendants—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all,
45:4:17:As it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations." This happened in the presence of God, in whom Abraham believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that do not yet exist.
45:4:18:Against all hope, Abraham believed in hope, so he became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
45:4:19:Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the fact that his body was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old) and that Sarah's womb was also dead.
45:4:20:Yet, he did not waver in unbelief regarding the promise of God but was strengthened in his faith, giving glory to God.
45:4:21:He was fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised.
45:4:22:That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness.
45:4:23:Now, the words "it was credited to him" were not written for Abraham alone,
45:4:24:But also for us, to whom it will be credited—those who believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45:4:25:He was delivered over to death because of our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
45:5:1:So, now that we have been made right with God through faith, we have peace with Him because of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45:5:2:Through Him, we've also gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of experiencing God's glory.
45:5:3:Not only that, but we also take pride in our troubles, knowing that trouble produces endurance.
45:5:4:Endurance, in turn, develops character, and character strengthens our hope.
45:5:5:This hope doesn't disappoint us, for God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
45:5:6:At just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
45:5:7:It's rare for someone to die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person someone might dare to die.
45:5:8:But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
45:5:9:Since we have now been justified by His blood, how much more will we be saved from God's wrath through Him!
45:5:10:For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, then even more so, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
45:5:11:And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45:5:12:As a result of one man's sin, Adam, death entered the world. And so, death spread to all people because all sinned.
45:5:13:Sin was indeed in the world before the law was given, but it wasn't counted as sin when there was no law.
45:5:14:Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who didn't break a command like Adam did. Adam is a pattern of the one to come.
45:5:15:But the gift isn't like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflowed to many.
45:5:16:The gift isn't like the result of one man's sin. The judgment following one sin brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.
45:5:17:If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
45:5:18:So then, just as one trespass led to condemnation for all people, so also one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all people.
45:5:19:For just as through one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man, many will be made righteous.
45:5:20:The law was introduced so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more.
45:5:21:In this way, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45:6:1:So what should we say then? Should we continue to sin so that grace may increase?
45:6:2:Absolutely not! We died to sin; how can we keep living in it?
45:6:3:Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45:6:4:Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too might walk in newness of life.
45:6:5:For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45:6:6:We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, and we would no longer be slaves to sin.
45:6:7:Because anyone who has died is freed from sin.
45:6:8:Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45:6:9:We know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has power over him.
45:6:10:When he died, he died to sin once for all; but now that he lives, he lives to God.
45:6:11:In the same way, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45:6:12:So do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies, making you obey its desires.
45:6:13:Instead, offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer every part of yourselves to him as instruments of righteousness.
45:6:14:For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law but under grace.
45:6:15:What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means!
45:6:16:Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves to the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45:6:17:But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have wholeheartedly obeyed the teaching to which you were committed.
45:6:18:You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
45:6:19:I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.
45:6:20:When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
45:6:21:What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
45:6:22:But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
45:6:23:For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45:7:1:Do you not know, my friends, that the law has authority over someone only as long as they live?
45:7:2:For example, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if he dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.
45:7:3:So, while her husband is alive, she would be considered an adulteress if she were to marry another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
45:7:4:In the same way, my friends, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another—to Him who was raised from the dead, in order to bear fruit for God.
45:7:5:While we were controlled by our sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, resulting in fruit for death.
45:7:6:But now, we have been released from the law, having died to what held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, not in the old way of the written code.
45:7:7:What should we say then? Is the law sinful? Absolutely not! In fact, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."
45:7:8:But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
45:7:9:Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life, and I died.
45:7:10:I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
45:7:11:For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.
45:7:12:So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.
45:7:13:Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, so that sin might be shown to be sinful beyond measure by means of the commandment.
45:7:14:We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
45:7:15:I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do; but what I hate, I do.
45:7:16:And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
45:7:17:As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
45:7:18:For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
45:7:19:For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.
45:7:20:Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
45:7:21:So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
45:7:22:For in my inner being, I delight in God's law;
45:7:23:But I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
45:7:24:What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
45:7:25:Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my sinful nature, I serve the law of sin.
45:8:1:So now, there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
45:8:2:For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.
45:8:3:What the law couldn't do, since it was weakened by the flesh, God did. He sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin offering, and condemned sin in the flesh,
45:8:4:so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45:8:5:Those who live by the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires, but those who live by the Spirit focus on what the Spirit wants.
45:8:6:To be focused on the flesh leads to death, but to be focused on the Spirit brings life and peace.
45:8:7:Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile to God; it doesn't submit to God's law and can't even do so.
45:8:8:Those who are controlled by the flesh can't please God.
45:8:9:But you're not controlled by the flesh; you're controlled by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God truly lives in you. If anyone doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, they don't belong to him.
45:8:10:And if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
45:8:11:If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you.
45:8:12:So then, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but not to the flesh, to live according to it.
45:8:13:For if you live by the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
45:8:14:All who are led by God's Spirit are God's children.
45:8:15:You didn't receive a spirit that makes you slaves to fear again; instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father!"
45:8:16:The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
45:8:17:And if we're children, then we're heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings so that we may also share in his glory.
45:8:18:I consider that our present sufferings aren't worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
45:8:19:For creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the children of God.
45:8:20:Creation was subjected to frustration, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope
45:8:21:that creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
45:8:22:We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
45:8:23:Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
45:8:24:In this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
45:8:25:But if we hope for what we don't yet have, we wait for it patiently.
45:8:26:In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We don't know what we should pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
45:8:27:And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God.
45:8:28:We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
45:8:29:For those God foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
45:8:30:And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
45:8:31:What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
45:8:32:He who didn't spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
45:8:33:Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
45:8:34:Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
45:8:35:Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
45:8:36:As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."
45:8:37:No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45:8:38:For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45:8:39:neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45:9:1:In Romans 9, Paul expresses his deep concern for his fellow Israelites:
45:9:2:I'm telling the truth in Christ; I'm not lying. My conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
45:9:3:that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
45:9:4:For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh.
45:9:5:They are the Israelites; theirs is the adoption as children, the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.
45:9:6:Their ancestors include the patriarchs, and from them came the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
45:9:7:But it's not as though the word of God has failed. For not everyone descended from Israel belongs to Israel.
45:9:8:Neither are they all children just because they are Abraham's descendants, but "through Isaac your offspring will be named."
45:9:9:This means that it's not the natural children who are God's children, but the children of the promise are considered descendants.
45:9:10:For this is how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."
45:9:11:Not only that, but Rebekah also had children by one man, our ancestor Isaac.
45:9:12:Before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose in election might stand,
45:9:13:not by works but by him who calls, it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger."
45:9:14:As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45:9:15:So what are we to say? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!
45:9:16:For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45:9:17:So it doesn't depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy.
45:9:18:For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up, to demonstrate my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed throughout the earth."
45:9:19:You might ask, "Then why does God still blame us? For who can resist his will?"
45:9:20:But who are you, a mere human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"
45:9:21:Doesn't the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special purposes and another for ordinary use?
45:9:22:What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath, prepared for destruction?
45:9:23:And what if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory?
45:9:24:We are those objects of mercy, including us whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles.
45:9:25:As he says in Hosea, "I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one."
45:9:26:"And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'"
45:9:27:Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved."
45:9:28:For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.
45:9:29:As Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord Almighty had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been like Gomorrah."
45:9:30:What should we conclude then? That Gentiles, who didn't pursue righteousness, have obtained a righteousness that comes from faith.
45:9:31:But Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.
45:9:32:Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were based on works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
45:9:33:As it is written, "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame."
45:10:1:Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
45:10:2:I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
45:10:3:Since they didn't understand God's righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
45:10:4:Christ is the fulfillment of the law, so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
45:10:5:Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: "The person who does these things will live by them."
45:10:6:But the righteousness that comes from faith says: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)
45:10:7:or "'Who will descend into the deep?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
45:10:8:Instead, what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:
45:10:9:If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45:10:10:For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
45:10:11:As Scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame."
45:10:12:For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,
45:10:13:For, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
45:10:14:But how can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
45:10:15:And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
45:10:16:However, not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
45:10:17:Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.
45:10:18:But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world."
45:10:19:Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding."
45:10:20:And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me."
45:10:21:But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."
45:11:1:So I ask you, has God rejected his people? Absolutely not! I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.
45:11:2:God hasn't turned away from his chosen people, whom he knew long ago. Don't you know what Scripture says about Elijah and how he pleaded with God against Israel?
45:11:3:"Lord, they've killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."
45:11:4:But what was God's response? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who haven't bowed down to Baal."
45:11:5:In the same way, at this present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
45:11:6:And if it's by grace, then it's no longer based on works; otherwise, grace wouldn't be grace.
45:11:7:What does this mean? Israel sought righteousness, but didn't find it, while the elect obtained it. The others were hardened,
45:11:8:as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, until this very day."
45:11:9:David also says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
45:11:10:Darken their eyes so they cannot see, and bend their backs forever."
45:11:11:Now I ask, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
45:11:12:If their trespass means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater will their full inclusion be!
45:11:13:I'm speaking to you Gentiles. As long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry
45:11:14:in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
45:11:15:For if their rejection brings reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
45:11:16:If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45:11:17:If some branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
45:11:18:don't consider yourself superior to those other branches. If you do, remember this: you don't support the root, but the root supports you.
45:11:19:You might say, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."
45:11:20:That's true. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Don't be arrogant, but be afraid.
45:11:21:For if God didn't spare the natural branches, he won't spare you either.
45:11:22:Consider both God's kindness and severity: his severity toward those who fell, but his kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.
45:11:23:And if they don't persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
45:11:24:If you were cut from a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!
45:11:25:I don't want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you won't be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,
45:11:26:and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
45:11:27:And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45:11:28:As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
45:11:29:for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.
45:11:30:Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
45:11:31:so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.
45:11:32:For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
45:11:33:Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
45:11:34:Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?
45:11:35:Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?
45:11:36:For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
45:12:1:Therefore, I urge you, my friends, because of God's great mercy, to offer your lives as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to him. This is your true and proper way to worship.
45:12:2:Don't conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by renewing your mind. Then you'll be able to discern what God's will is—his good, pleasing, and perfect plan.
45:12:3:With the grace given to me, I tell each one of you not to think too highly of yourself, but rather to have a sober judgment, according to the measure of faith that God has given you.
45:12:4:Just as our bodies have many parts, and each part has a specific function,
45:12:5:So we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.
45:12:6:We all have different gifts, according to the grace given to us. If your gift is prophecy, use it according to your faith;
45:12:7:If it is serving, serve well; if it is teaching, teach with dedication;
45:12:8:If it is encouraging others, encourage wholeheartedly; if it is giving, give generously; if it is leading, lead diligently; if it is showing mercy, do so cheerfully.
45:12:9:Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
45:12:10:Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.
45:12:11:Never lack in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
45:12:12:Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, and persist in prayer.
45:12:13:Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
45:12:14:Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
45:12:15:Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
45:12:16:Live in harmony with one another. Don't be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Don't be conceited.
45:12:17:Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
45:12:18:If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
45:12:19:Don't take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord.
45:12:20:On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.
45:12:21:Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45:13:1:Let's respect and obey the governing authorities, because they have been established by God.
45:13:2:So whoever opposes the authorities is actually opposing what God has set up, and those who do so will face judgment.
45:13:3:Rulers are not a threat to good behavior but to bad. If you want to avoid being afraid of authority, do what is right and you will be praised.
45:13:4:For the ruler is God's servant working for your benefit. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because they don't carry the sword without reason. They are also God's servants, carrying out punishment on wrongdoers.
45:13:5:Therefore, we must submit to authorities, not only because of possible punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.
45:13:6:This is why you pay taxes, too, since the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.
45:13:7:Pay everyone what you owe them: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
45:13:8:Don't owe anyone anything, except for the ongoing debt to love one another, because whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
45:13:9:The commandments, such as "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this one rule: "Love your neighbor as yourself."
45:13:10:Love does no harm to its neighbor, so love is the fulfillment of the law.
45:13:11:As we understand the present time, it's important to act, because now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
45:13:12:The night is almost over, and the day is near. So let's put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45:13:13:Let's behave decently, as in the daytime, not engaging in wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, debauchery, rivalry, or jealousy.
45:13:14:Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and don't think about how to gratify the desires of your sinful nature.
45:14:1:Accept those who are weak in faith, but don't argue about their doubtful opinions.
45:14:2:One person has faith to eat all kinds of food, while another with weaker faith eats only vegetables.
45:14:3:The one who eats everything must not look down on the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them both.
45:14:4:Who are you to judge someone else's servant? They stand or fall before their own master, and they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
45:14:5:Some people consider one day more sacred than others, while others consider every day alike. Each person should be fully convinced in their own mind.
45:14:6:Those who observe a special day do so to honor the Lord, and those who eat do so to honor the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and those who abstain also do it to honor the Lord and give thanks to God.
45:14:7:For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
45:14:8:If we live, we live for the Lord; if we die, we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45:14:9:For this reason, Christ died and returned to life, so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
45:14:10:So why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.
45:14:11:As it is written: "As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God."
45:14:12:So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
45:14:13:Let's stop judging one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.
45:14:14:I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.
45:14:15:If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy them with your food, for whom Christ died.
45:14:16:Do not let what you consider good be spoken of as evil.
45:14:17:For the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45:14:18:Whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
45:14:19:So let's strive to maintain peace and to build each other up.
45:14:20:Don't destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
45:14:21:It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
45:14:22:Keep your beliefs about such things between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn themselves by what they approve.
45:14:23:But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
45:15:1:Now, we who are strong should support the weaknesses of those who aren't and not seek to please ourselves.
45:15:2:Each person should aim to please their neighbor for their good, leading to growth in character.
45:15:3:For even Christ did not live to please himself, but as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me."
45:15:4:Through the endurance and encouragement of the Scriptures, we can learn and maintain our hope.
45:15:5:May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another, following the example of Christ Jesus.
45:15:6:So that with one mind and voice, you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45:15:7:Accept one another just as Christ accepted you, to bring glory to God.
45:15:8:Remember that Christ became a servant to the Jews, proving God's truthfulness and fulfilling the promises made to their ancestors.
45:15:9:And for the Gentiles, they too can glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: "For this reason, I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing praises to your name."
45:15:10:Again, it says: "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
45:15:11:And again: "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him."
45:15:12:Isaiah also says: "There shall be a root of Jesse, and he who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope."
45:15:13:May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit, you may abound in hope.
45:15:14:I am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you are full of goodness, filled with knowledge, and able to instruct one another.
45:15:15:Nevertheless, I have written to you quite boldly on some points as a reminder, because of the grace God has given me.
45:15:16:To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45:15:17:In Christ Jesus, I have reason to boast about my work for God.
45:15:18:For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,
45:15:19:Through the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
45:15:20:My aim has always been to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.
45:15:21:As it is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand."
45:15:22:This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
45:15:23:But now, since there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you,
45:15:24:I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.
45:15:25:Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord's people there.
45:15:26:For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord's people in Jerusalem.
45:15:27:They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
45:15:28:So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
45:15:29:I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
45:15:30:I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
45:15:31:Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the Lord's people there.
45:15:32:So that, by God's will, I may come to you with joy and together with you find rest.
45:15:33:The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45:16:1:Now I introduce to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae.
45:16:2:Please welcome her in the Lord's name, as is fitting for God's people, and assist her with whatever she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many, including myself.
45:16:3:Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
45:16:4:who risked their lives for me. I am grateful to them, and so are all the Gentile churches.
45:16:5:Also greet the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia.
45:16:6:Say hello to Mary, who has worked hard for your benefit.
45:16:7:Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews and fellow prisoners, who are well-known among the apostles and were followers of Christ before me.
45:16:8:Give my best to Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.
45:16:9:Greet Urbanus, our coworker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45:16:10:Send my regards to Apelles, who has proven himself in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
45:16:11:Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet the members of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
45:16:12:Extend my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, those diligent women who work for the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has worked so hard for the Lord.
45:16:13:Say hello to Rufus, chosen by the Lord, and his mother, who has been like a mother to me as well.
45:16:14:Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters with them.
45:16:15:Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, along with all the believers who are with them.
45:16:16:Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their greetings.
45:16:17:I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
45:16:18:For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and through smooth talk and flattery, they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
45:16:19:Your obedience is well-known, and I am happy for you. But I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent concerning evil.
45:16:20:The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45:16:21:My coworker Timothy sends his greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
45:16:22:I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45:16:23:Gaius, who hosts me and the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus also send their greetings.
45:16:24:May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
45:16:25:Now to him who can strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages,
45:16:26:but now made known through the prophetic writings and by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might come to the obedience of faith—
45:16:27:to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever. Amen.
