19:1:1:Blessed is the person who does not follow the advice of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit with those who mock.
19:1:2:Instead, they find joy in the Lord's teachings and meditate on them day and night.
19:1:3:They are like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in its season, with leaves that do not wither; whatever they do prospers.
19:1:4:Not so for the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
19:1:5:Therefore, the wicked won't stand during the judgment, nor will sinners be part of the assembly of the righteous.
19:1:6:For the Lord watches over the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
19:2:1:Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain?
19:2:2:The kings of the earth take their stand, and rulers band together against the Lord and His Anointed One.
19:2:3:"Let's break free from their chains," they say, "and throw off their shackles."
19:2:4:The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
19:2:5:Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them with His wrath, saying,
19:2:6:"I have installed my King on Zion, my holy mountain."
19:2:7:I will proclaim the Lord's decree: He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father.
19:2:8:Ask of Me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession.
19:2:9:You will break them with an iron scepter; you will shatter them like pottery."
19:2:10:So now, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
19:2:11:Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
19:2:12:Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, for His wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
19:3:1:Lord, how numerous are my enemies! Many rise up against me.
19:3:2:Many say of me, "There's no help for him in God."
19:3:3:But you, O Lord, are a shield around me; you're my glory and the one who lifts my head.
19:3:4:I cry out to the Lord with my voice, and he answers me from his holy mountain.
19:3:5:I lay down and sleep; I wake again because the Lord sustains me.
19:3:6:I'm not afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
19:3:7:Arise, O Lord! Save me, my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
19:3:8:Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing is upon your people.
19:4:1:Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness. You have relieved me in my distress; show me mercy and hear my prayer.
19:4:2:You great people, how long will you dishonor my glory? How long will you love empty words and chase after lies? Selah.
19:4:3:Know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
19:4:4:Tremble and do not sin; reflect upon your bed and be still. Selah.
19:4:5:Offer right sacrifices and put your trust in the Lord.
19:4:6:Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord.
19:4:7:You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and wine abound.
19:4:8:In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.
19:5:1:Listen to my words, O Lord; consider my meditation.
19:5:2:Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for I pray to you.
19:5:3:In the morning, you hear my voice, Lord; in the morning, I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
19:5:4:For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil cannot dwell with you.
19:5:5:The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.
19:5:6:You destroy those who tell lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful.
19:5:7:But by your great love, I can enter your house; in reverence, I bow down toward your holy temple.
19:5:8:Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
19:5:9:For there is no truth in their mouths; their hearts are filled with destruction, their throats are open graves, and they flatter with their tongues.
19:5:10:Declare them guilty, O God; let their schemes fail. Drive them away because of their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
19:5:11:But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them sing joyful praises forever. Protect them, so that those who love your name may be filled with joy.
19:5:12:For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
19:6:1:O Lord, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
19:6:2:Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak; heal me, Lord, for my bones are troubled.
19:6:3:My soul is deeply distressed; how long, O Lord, will you wait?
19:6:4:Turn to me, Lord, and deliver my life; save me because of your unfailing love.
19:6:5:For in death there's no remembrance of you; who can praise you from the grave?
19:6:6:I'm worn out from my groaning; every night I flood my bed with tears, drenching it through and through.
19:6:7:My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.
19:6:8:Away from me, all you evildoers, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.
19:6:9:The Lord has heard my cry for help; the Lord will accept my prayer.
19:6:10:Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly dismayed; let them turn back and suddenly be humiliated.
19:7:1:O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me.
19:7:2:Lest they tear me apart like a lion, ripping me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
19:7:3:O LORD my God, if I have done wrong or am guilty of injustice, 
19:7:4:If I've betrayed a friend or helped an evil person without cause,
19:7:5:Then let my enemies pursue and overtake me, let them trample my life into the ground and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
19:7:6:Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my adversaries. Awake, my God, and decree justice.
19:7:7:Let the assembly of the nations gather around you, and take your seat on high over them.
19:7:8:The LORD judges the people; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity.
19:7:9:Put an end to the wickedness of the wicked, but establish the righteous, for you test the hearts and minds, O righteous God.
19:7:10:My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
19:7:11:God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day.
19:7:12:If a person does not repent, God will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.
19:7:13:He has prepared deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.
19:7:14:Behold, the wicked conceive evil, are pregnant with mischief, and give birth to lies.
19:7:15:They dig a hole and make it deep, but they fall into the pit they have made.
19:7:16:The mischief they cause will return upon their own heads, and their violence will come down on their own scalps.
19:7:17:I will give thanks to the LORD for his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
19:8:1:O Lord, our Master, how majestic is your name throughout the earth! Your glory is higher than the heavens.
19:8:2:You've set your splendor above the skies, using the mouths of children and infants to silence your enemies and those who oppose you.
19:8:3:When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and stars that you have established,
19:8:4:I wonder, what are human beings that you think of them? What is mankind that you care for them?
19:8:5:You made them only a little lower than the angels, crowning them with glory and honor.
19:8:6:You've given them dominion over the works of your hands, putting all things under their feet.
19:8:7:Sheep and oxen, all of them, wild animals too,
19:8:8:The birds in the sky, and fish in the sea, everything that swims the ocean currents.
19:8:9:O Lord, our Master, how majestic is your name throughout the earth!
19:9:1:To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, a Psalm of David. I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will declare all your wondrous deeds.
19:9:2:I'll rejoice and be glad in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
19:9:3:When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before your presence.
19:9:4:For you have upheld my right and my cause; you sit on your throne as a righteous judge.
19:9:5:You've rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked, and erased their names forever and ever.
19:9:6:The enemy is finished—in ruins forever; you've uprooted their cities, and even the memory of them has perished.
19:9:7:But the LORD endures forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
19:9:8:He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with fairness.
19:9:9:The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
19:9:10:Those who know your name trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you.
19:9:11:Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim his deeds among the nations.
19:9:12:For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.
19:9:13:Be gracious to me, O LORD; see how I suffer from those who hate me, you who lift me up from the gates of death.
19:9:14:That I may recount all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion, and rejoice in your salvation.
19:9:15:The nations have sunk in the pit they made; their own foot is caught in the net they hid.
19:9:16:The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment. The wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
19:9:17:The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
19:9:18:For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
19:9:19:Arise, O LORD, let no man prevail; let the nations be judged before you.
19:9:20:Put them in fear, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. 
19:10:1:Why, O Lord, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
19:10:2:The wicked, in their arrogance, persecute the poor. Let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
19:10:3:For the wicked boasts about his heart's desires; he blesses the greedy and despises the Lord.
19:10:4:The wicked, in his pride, does not seek God; all his thoughts are, "There is no God."
19:10:5:His ways are always prosperous; your judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.
19:10:6:He says to himself, "I will never be shaken; no harm will ever come to me or my descendants."
19:10:7:His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; under his tongue lies mischief and iniquity.
19:10:8:He lies in ambush near villages; in secret, he murders the innocent; his eyes stealthily watch for the helpless.
19:10:9:He waits in hiding like a lion in his den; he waits to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws them into his net.
19:10:10:The helpless are crushed, collapse, and fall under his strength.
19:10:11:He thinks to himself, "God has forgotten; he hides his face and never sees."
19:10:12:Rise up, O Lord; O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the afflicted.
19:10:13:Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, "You will not call me to account"?
19:10:14:But you do see; you take note of mischief and distress, that you may take matters into your hands. The helpless commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
19:10:15:Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call their wickedness to account until you find none.
19:10:16:The Lord is King forever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.
19:10:17:O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you strengthen their heart and incline your ear.
19:10:18:To do justice for the orphan and the oppressed, so that those from earth may strike terror no more.
19:11:1:In the Lord I find refuge. How can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to your mountain"?
19:11:2:For look! The wicked bend their bows and set their arrows on the strings, ready to shoot from the shadows at those with upright hearts.
19:11:3:When foundations crumble, what can the righteous do?
19:11:4:The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne resides in heaven. His eyes watch closely, examining all of humanity.
19:11:5:The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked, but He hates those who love violence.
19:11:6:He will rain down fire and brimstone upon the wicked; a scorching wind will be their portion.
19:11:7:For the Lord is righteous; He loves justice. Those with pure hearts will see His face.
19:12:1:Help, O Lord, for the godly have become scarce; true believers are hard to find among humanity.
19:12:2:People speak deceitfully to one another; their words are filled with flattery and lies.
19:12:3:May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and silence every boastful tongue.
19:12:4:They say, "With our tongues, we'll prevail; our lips are our own—who can master us?"
19:12:5:"Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the Lord. "I will protect them from those who malign them."
19:12:6:The words of the Lord are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over.
19:12:7:You, O Lord, will guard us; you will protect us from this generation forever.
19:12:8:The wicked prowl on every side, as vileness is exalted among humanity.
19:13:1:How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
19:13:2:How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and have sorrow in my heart day after day? How long will my enemy triumph over me?
19:13:3:Consider me and answer, Lord my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death.
19:13:4:My enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall.
19:13:5:But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.
19:13:6:I will sing to the Lord, for he has been good to me.
19:14:1:The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and commit vile deeds; not one of them does good.
19:14:2:From heaven, the Lord looks down upon humanity to see if any understand or seek God.
19:14:3:All have turned away and become corrupt; no one does good, not even one.
19:14:4:Will evildoers never learn? They devour my people as if consuming bread, without ever calling on the Lord.
19:14:5:Great fear will come upon them, for God is with the righteous generation.
19:14:6:You may shame the plans of the poor, but their refuge is in the Lord.
19:14:7:Oh, that salvation for Israel would come from Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
19:15:1:Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who can live on your holy mountain?
19:15:2:The one who walks with integrity, acts justly, and speaks the truth from their heart.
19:15:3:They do not slander with their tongue, nor harm their neighbor, nor spread disgrace against others.
19:15:4:In their eyes, a vile person is despised, but they honor those who fear the Lord. They keep their promises even when it hurts, and never change their mind.
19:15:5:They lend money without exploiting others, and refuse to accept bribes against the innocent. Those who live like this will never be shaken.
19:16:1:Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in You.
19:16:2:I declare to the LORD, "You are my Lord; apart from You, I have no good thing."
19:16:3:As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.
19:16:4:Those who run after other gods will suffer more sorrows; I will not pour out their offerings of blood or speak their names with my lips.
19:16:5:The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; He sustains my destiny.
19:16:6:The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
19:16:7:I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night, my heart instructs me.
19:16:8:I keep the LORD always before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
19:16:9:Therefore, my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my body also rests securely.
19:16:10:For You will not abandon me to the grave, nor will You let Your faithful one see decay.
19:16:11:You reveal to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy, and at Your right hand are eternal pleasures.
19:17:1:Hear me, O Lord, for I cry out to you; listen closely to my plea for justice.
19:17:2:Examine my heart and mind, as you would test gold and silver; let your gaze rest on me with fairness.
19:17:3:For you have seen that my thoughts are pure, and my words are true, spoken from a sincere heart.
19:17:4:I have not followed the path of evildoers, nor have I walked in the footsteps of those who deceive.
19:17:5:I have been steadfast in my ways, and my feet have not slipped from the path you set before me.
19:17:6:Because I know you will answer me, God, I call upon you; please lend your ear to my words.
19:17:7:Show me your wondrous love, O Savior of those who trust in you; protect them from their enemies' attacks.
19:17:8:Keep me safe, like the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings.
19:17:9:Shield me from the wicked who oppress me, from the deadly enemies who surround me.
19:17:10:They have closed their hearts to compassion; they speak arrogantly with malice.
19:17:11:Now they track me down, eager to throw me to the ground.
19:17:12:Like a lion hungry for prey, they lurk in secret, ready to pounce.
19:17:13:Rise up, O Lord, confront them and bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.
19:17:14:By your hand, save me from such people, Lord, from those whose reward is in this life. May you fill the bellies of your children with what you've stored up for the wicked.
19:17:15:As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with your likeness.
19:18:1:I love you, Lord, my strength.
19:18:2:The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I find protection.
19:18:3:He is my shield, the power that saves me, and my place of safety.
19:18:4:I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I was saved from my enemies.
19:18:5:The cords of death entangled me; floods of destruction overwhelmed me.
19:18:6:In my distress, I called upon the Lord and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry reached His ears.
19:18:7:Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains quaked, they were shaken because He was angry.
19:18:8:Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; burning coals blazed out of it.
19:18:9:He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds under His feet.
19:18:10:He rode on a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind.
19:18:11:He made darkness His covering, His canopy around Him—the dark rain clouds of the sky.
19:18:12:Out of the brightness before Him, His clouds passed, hailstones and bolts of lightning.
19:18:13:The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
19:18:14:He shot His arrows and scattered the enemy; great bolts of lightning routed them.
19:18:15:The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the world laid bare at Your rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of breath from Your nostrils.
19:18:16:He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters.
19:18:17:He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from those who were too strong for me.
19:18:18:They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the Lord was my support.
19:18:19:He brought me out into a spacious place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
19:18:20:The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me based on the cleanness of my hands.
19:18:21:For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
19:18:22:All His laws are before me; I have not turned away from His decrees.
19:18:23:I am blameless before Him, and I have kept myself from sin.
19:18:24:The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, because of the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
19:18:25:To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, to the blameless You reveal Yourself as blameless.
19:18:26:To the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the devious You prove shrewd.
19:18:27:You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.
19:18:28:You, Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.
19:18:29:With Your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.
19:18:30:As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him.
19:18:31:For who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?
19:18:32:It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
19:18:33:He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; He enables me to stand on the heights.
19:18:34:He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19:18:35:You give me Your shield of victory, and Your right hand sustains me; You stoop down to make me great.
19:18:36:You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not turn.
19:18:37:I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
19:18:38:I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
19:18:39:You armed me with strength for battle; You humbled my adversaries before me.
19:18:40:You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed those who hated me.
19:18:41:They cried for help, but there was no one to save them; they called to the Lord, but He did not answer.
19:18:42:I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets.
19:18:43:You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; You have made me the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me.
19:18:44:As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me.
19:18:45:They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.
19:18:46:The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!
19:18:47:He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me,
19:18:48:Who saves me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent people.
19:18:49:Therefore, I will praise You, Lord, among the nations; I will sing the praises of Your name.
19:18:50:He gives His king great victories; He shows unfailing love to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
19:19:1:The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
19:19:2:Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.
19:19:3:There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
19:19:4:Their message goes out through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens, he has pitched a tent for the sun,
19:19:5:Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, rejoicing like a strong man to run its course.
19:19:6:From one end of the heavens it rises, and its circuit runs to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.
19:19:7:The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, making wise the simple.
19:19:8:The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart; the commandments of the Lord are pure, enlightening the eyes.
19:19:9:The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and altogether righteous.
19:19:10:They are more precious than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
19:19:11:Moreover, by them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
19:19:12:Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults.
19:19:13:Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
19:19:14:May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.
19:20:1:May the Lord answer you in times of trouble; may the God of Jacob protect you.
19:20:2:From his sanctuary, let him send help and support from Zion.
19:20:3:Remembering all your offerings, may he accept your burnt sacrifices. 
19:20:4:Granting your heart's desires, may he fulfill all your plans.
19:20:5:We will celebrate your victory and raise our banners in the name of our God. May the Lord fulfill all your requests.
19:20:6:Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed; he answers them from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.
19:20:7:Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we rely on the name of the Lord our God.
19:20:8:They collapse and fall, while we rise and stand firm.
19:20:9:Lord, save us! Answer us when we call.
19:21:1:O Lord, the king rejoices in your strength; how greatly he exults in your salvation!
19:21:2:You have granted him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips.
19:21:3:For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of pure gold upon his head.
19:21:4:He asked life from you, and you gave it to him—length of days forever and ever.
19:21:5:His glory is great through your help; splendor and majesty you bestow on him.
19:21:6:You bestow on him blessings forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
19:21:7:For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the steadfast love of the Most High, he shall not be moved.
19:21:8:Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will discover those who hate you.
19:21:9:You will make them like a fiery furnace when you appear; the Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them.
19:21:10:You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the children of mankind.
19:21:11:Though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed.
19:21:12:For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows.
19:21:13:Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.
19:22:1:My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? I cry out, but you seem so far away.
19:22:2:Day and night, I call for your help, but there's no answer; it feels like you don't hear my prayers.
19:22:3:Yet you are holy, enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
19:22:4:In the past, our ancestors trusted in you, and you delivered them.
19:22:5:They cried out to you and were saved; they trusted in you and were not disappointed.
19:22:6:But as for me, I am a worm, not a man; scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
19:22:7:All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads.
19:22:8:"He trusts in the Lord," they say, "let the Lord rescue him. Let the Lord deliver him, since he delights in him."
19:22:9:From birth, you brought me forth; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast.
19:22:10:I was cast upon you from the womb; you have been my God since my mother bore me.
19:22:11:Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
19:22:12:Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
19:22:13:They open their mouths wide against me, like roaring and ravenous lions.
19:22:14:I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, melting within me.
19:22:15:My strength has dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
19:22:16:Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me. They have pierced my hands and feet.
19:22:17:I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.
19:22:18:They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.
19:22:19:But you, Lord, do not be far away; come quickly to help me.
19:22:20:Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.
19:22:21:Save me from the lion's mouth, and rescue me from the horns of the wild oxen.
19:22:22:I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly, I will praise you.
19:22:23:All who fear the Lord, praise him! All descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
19:22:24:For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.
19:22:25:Because of you, I offer praise in the great assembly; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear you.
19:22:26:The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord will praise him—may their hearts live forever!
19:22:27:All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him.
19:22:28:For dominion belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.
19:22:29:All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—even those who cannot keep themselves alive.
19:22:30:Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord.
19:22:31:They will proclaim his righteousness, declaring to a people yet unborn: He has done it!
19:23:1:The Lord is my shepherd; I have everything I need.
19:23:2:He leads me to peaceful pastures and guides me beside calm waters.
19:23:3:My soul is restored; He directs me on the right path for His name's sake.
19:23:4:Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and staff comfort me.
19:23:5:You prepare a feast before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
19:23:6:Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
19:24:1:The earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord; the world and all who live in it are His.
19:24:2:He established it upon the seas and set it firmly on the waters.
19:24:3:Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who can stand in His holy place?
19:24:4:Only those with clean hands and pure hearts, who have not worshiped idols or sworn falsely.
19:24:5:They will receive blessings from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior.
19:24:6:Such is the generation that seeks Him, those who long for the face of the God of Jacob.
19:24:7:Lift up your heads, you gates! Be raised, you ancient doors, so the King of glory may enter!
19:24:8:Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, a mighty warrior!
19:24:9:Lift up your heads, you gates! Open wide, you ancient doors, so the King of glory may come in!
19:24:10:Who is He, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty, He is the King of glory!
19:25:1:Unto you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
19:25:2:In you, my God, I trust; let me not be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me.
19:25:3:Indeed, none who wait for you shall be ashamed; but those who act treacherously without cause will face disgrace.
19:25:4:Teach me your ways, O LORD, and guide me on the right path, because of my adversaries.
19:25:5:Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; I wait for you all day long.
19:25:6:Remember, O LORD, your tender mercies and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
19:25:7:Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.
19:25:8:Good and upright is the LORD; therefore, he instructs sinners in the way.
19:25:9:He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
19:25:10:All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
19:25:11:For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
19:25:12:Who is the person that fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way he should choose.
19:25:13:His soul shall dwell at ease, and his offspring shall inherit the land.
19:25:14:The secret counsel of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.
19:25:15:My eyes are always on the LORD, for he will free my feet from the net.
19:25:16:Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
19:25:17:The troubles of my heart have multiplied; bring me out of my distresses.
19:25:18:Look upon my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.
19:25:19:Consider how numerous my enemies are, and with what violent hatred they hate me.
19:25:20:Protect my life and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
19:25:21:May integrity and uprightness protect me, because I wait for you.
19:25:22:Redeem Israel, O God, from all their troubles.
19:26:1:Lord, judge me fairly, for I have lived with integrity and trusted in you without wavering.
19:26:2:Examine me, O God, and put my heart and mind to the test; refine my motives and thoughts.
19:26:3:Your steadfast love is always before my eyes, and I walk in your truth.
19:26:4:I do not associate with deceitful people, nor do I keep company with hypocrites.
19:26:5:I detest the gatherings of evildoers and refuse to sit among the wicked.
19:26:6:I wash my hands in innocence, O Lord, that I may join the procession around your altar,
19:26:7:Singing songs of thanksgiving and telling of all your wondrous deeds.
19:26:8:Lord, I love the house where you dwell, the place where your glory resides.
19:26:9:Do not sweep me away with sinners, nor take my life along with those who shed blood,
19:26:10:Whose hands are filled with evil schemes and whose right hands are full of bribes.
19:26:11:But as for me, I will live with integrity; redeem me, O Lord, and show me mercy.
19:26:12:My feet stand on level ground; in the assembly, I will bless the Lord.
19:27:1:The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear? The Lord protects my life; of whom should I be afraid?
19:27:2:When evildoers come at me to devour my flesh, it's my enemies and foes who stumble and fall.
19:27:3:Even if an army surrounds me, my heart won't fear; even if war breaks out against me, I will remain confident.
19:27:4:One thing I ask from the Lord, this is what I seek: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to seek Him in His temple.
19:27:5:For in times of trouble, He will hide me in His shelter; in the secret place of His tent, He will conceal me; He will set me high upon a rock.
19:27:6:Now my head is lifted up above my enemies around me; I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tent and sing praises to the Lord.
19:27:7:Hear me, Lord, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me.
19:27:8:You have said, "Seek my face." My heart responds, "Your face, Lord, I will seek."
19:27:9:Don't hide Your face from me; don't turn Your servant away in anger. You have been my help; don't abandon or forsake me, O God of my salvation.
19:27:10:Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will take me in.
19:27:11:Teach me Your way, Lord, and lead me on a straight path because of my enemies.
19:27:12:Don't hand me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations.
19:27:13:I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
19:27:14:Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart, and wait for the Lord.
19:28:1:Lord, I call out to you; my Rock, don't be silent toward me. If you don't respond, I might become like those who have descended into the pit.
19:28:2:Hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help, as I lift my hands toward your most holy sanctuary.
19:28:3:Please don't drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak kindly to their neighbors while harboring malice in their hearts.
19:28:4:Give them what they deserve, according to their deeds and the wickedness of their actions; repay them for the work of their hands and give them their just reward.
19:28:5:Because they don't understand the Lord's work or the deeds he performs, he will tear them down and not build them up.
19:28:6:Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.
19:28:7:The Lord is my strength and shield; I trust in him with all my heart. He helps me, and my heart rejoices; I sing a song of gratitude to him.
19:28:8:The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
19:28:9:Save your people and bless your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
19:29:1:Give credit to the Lord, you heavenly beings; honor the Lord for His glory and strength.
19:29:2:Recognize the Lord's majestic name; worship Him in all His holy splendor.
19:29:3:The voice of the Lord echoes above the waters; the God of glory thunders over the mighty seas.
19:29:4:The Lord's voice is powerful; His words are full of majesty.
19:29:5:The voice of the Lord breaks the great cedars; He shatters them like twigs.
19:29:6:He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.
19:29:7:The voice of the Lord splits flames of fire.
19:29:8:The Lord's voice shakes the wilderness; it quakes the desert of Kadesh.
19:29:9:The voice of the Lord causes the deer to give birth and strips the forests bare; in His temple, everyone proclaims His glory.
19:29:10:The Lord sits as King upon the flood; He reigns as King forever.
19:29:11:The Lord gives strength to His people; He blesses them with peace.
19:30:1:In times of distress, I lift my voice to You, O Lord; I extol Your name for You have saved me.
19:30:2:My God, I cried out to You, and You healed me.
19:30:3:You brought me back from the brink of death, saving me from those who sought my downfall.
19:30:4:Sing praises to the Lord, all you faithful ones, and give thanks to His holy name.
19:30:5:His anger lasts only a moment, but His favor is for a lifetime; weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes with the morning.
19:30:6:When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken."
19:30:7:By Your favor, O Lord, You made me strong; but when You hid Your face, I was filled with fear.
19:30:8:To You, O Lord, I called out; I pleaded for Your mercy:
19:30:9:"What gain is there in my destruction if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your truth?"
19:30:10:Hear me, O Lord, and show me Your mercy; be my helper, O God.
19:30:11:You turned my mourning into dancing; You removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
19:30:12:So that my heart may sing Your praises and not remain silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.
19:31:1:In you, O Lord, I find refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.
19:31:2:Hear me and quickly come to my rescue; be my rock of protection, a fortress where I can find safety.
19:31:3:For you are my rock and my stronghold; guide me and lead me for the sake of your name.
19:31:4:Free me from the trap they've set for me, for you are my protector.
19:31:5:Into your hands I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God.
19:31:6:I despise those who worship false idols, but I trust in the Lord.
19:31:7:I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, for you have seen my affliction and known the troubles of my soul.
19:31:8:You have not handed me over to the enemy, but have set my feet in a spacious place.
19:31:9:Show me mercy, O Lord, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, and my body and soul as well.
19:31:10:My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails due to my sin, and my bones waste away.
19:31:11:Because of all my enemies, I am scorned by my neighbors and an object of dread to my friends—those who see me on the street flee from me.
19:31:12:I am forgotten like the dead, out of mind; I have become like a broken vessel.
19:31:13:I hear the whispers of many, terror surrounds me; they conspire against me and plot to take my life.
19:31:14:But I trust in you, O Lord; I say, "You are my God."
19:31:15:My times are in your hands; rescue me from the hands of my enemies and those who pursue me.
19:31:16:Let your face shine upon your servant; save me in your unfailing love.
19:31:17:O Lord, let me not be put to shame, for I have called upon you; let the wicked be put to shame and lie silent in the grave.
19:31:18:Silence the lying lips that speak insolently against the righteous with pride and contempt.
19:31:19:How abundant is the goodness you've stored up for those who fear you, which you bestow in the sight of all on those who take refuge in you.
19:31:20:In the shelter of your presence, you hide them from human plots; you hold them safe under your shelter from accusing tongues.
19:31:21:Blessed be the Lord, for he has shown me his amazing love when I was like a city under siege.
19:31:22:In my alarm, I said, "I am cut off from your sight!" Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.
19:31:23:Love the Lord, all his faithful people! The Lord preserves the loyal, but repays the arrogant in full.
19:31:24:Be strong and courageous, all you who hope in the Lord.
19:32:1:Blessed is the one whose disobedience is forgiven, and whose sin is covered.
19:32:2:Happy is the person to whom the Lord does not hold guilt, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
19:32:3:When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
19:32:4:For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained as in the summer heat. Selah
19:32:5:I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not hide my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my wrongdoings to the Lord," and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
19:32:6:For this reason, let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.
19:32:7:You are my hiding place; you protect me from trouble. You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah
19:32:8:I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
19:32:9:Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle, or they will not come to you.
19:32:10:Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord.
19:32:11:Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
19:33:1:Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones; it's fitting for the upright to praise Him.
19:33:2:Play the harp to honor the LORD; use a ten-stringed lyre to sing praises to Him.
19:33:3:Compose new songs to celebrate Him; skillfully perform with joyful shouts.
19:33:4:For the word of the LORD is true and trustworthy; all His works are done in faithfulness.
19:33:5:He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is filled with the LORD's unfailing love.
19:33:6:By His command, the heavens were made; all their host created by the breath of His mouth.
19:33:7:He gathered the waters of the sea as if in a storehouse; He put the depths in their place.
19:33:8:Let everyone on earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
19:33:9:For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.
19:33:10:The LORD nullifies the plans of nations; He thwarts the schemes of the peoples.
19:33:11:But the counsel of the LORD endures forever; the intentions of His heart span all generations.
19:33:12:Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His own inheritance.
19:33:13:From heaven, the LORD looks down; He sees all of humanity.
19:33:14:From His dwelling place, He observes everyone who lives on earth.
19:33:15:He who fashions the hearts of all, considers everything they do.
19:33:16:A king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
19:33:17:The horse is a false hope for salvation; it cannot rescue by its great power.
19:33:18:But the LORD's eyes are on those who fear Him, on those who rely on His unfailing love,
19:33:19:To deliver them from death and keep them alive in times of famine.
19:33:20:We wait patiently for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
19:33:21:In Him, our hearts rejoice, for we trust in His holy name.
19:33:22:May Your unfailing love be upon us, LORD, even as we put our hope in You.
19:34:1: I will praise the Lord at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.
19:34:2: My soul takes pride in the Lord; let the humble hear and rejoice.
19:34:3: Join me in glorifying the Lord; together, let us exalt His name.
19:34:4: I sought the Lord, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears.
19:34:5: Those who look to Him are radiant; their faces shall never be covered with shame.
19:34:6: This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him; He saved him from all his troubles.
19:34:7: The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and He rescues them.
19:34:8: Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him.
19:34:9: Fear the Lord, you His holy people, for those who fear Him lack nothing.
19:34:10: Young lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing.
19:34:11: Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
19:34:12: Whoever loves life and desires to see many good days,
19:34:13: keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceitfully.
19:34:14: Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
19:34:15: The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their cry.
19:34:16: The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth.
19:34:17: The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; He delivers them from all their troubles.
19:34:18: The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
19:34:19: Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him from them all.
19:34:20: He protects all his bones; not one of them will be broken.
19:34:21: Evil will slay the wicked; those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
19:34:22: The Lord redeems the lives of His servants; none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
19:35:1:Contend, O Lord, with those who contend against me; fight against those who fight against me.
19:35:2:Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up in my defense.
19:35:3:Draw out the spear and bar the way against my pursuers; say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
19:35:4:Let those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; let those who plot my ruin be turned back in confusion.
19:35:5:May they become like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away.
19:35:6:Make their path dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
19:35:7:For without cause they hid their net for me; without reason they dug a pit for my soul.
19:35:8:Let destruction come upon them unexpectedly, and let the net they hid ensnare them; may they fall into their own destruction.
19:35:9:Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord, exulting in his deliverance.
19:35:10:All my bones will say, "Lord, who is like you? You rescue the weak from the strong, the needy from the oppressor."
19:35:11:Malicious witnesses rise up; they question me about things I know nothing about.
19:35:12:They repay me evil for good, leaving my soul desolate.
19:35:13:But when they were ill, I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed on my chest.
19:35:14:I went about as though it were my friend or brother; I bowed down in mourning, as one who mourns for a mother.
19:35:15:But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing.
19:35:16:Like godless mockers at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.
19:35:17:Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.
19:35:18:I will give you thanks in the great congregation; among throngs of people, I will praise you.
19:35:19:Let not those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me; nor let those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.
19:35:20:For they do not speak peace, but devise deceitful words against the quiet ones in the land.
19:35:21:They open wide their mouths against me, saying, "Aha, Aha! Our eyes have seen it."
19:35:22:You have seen, O Lord; be not silent. O Lord, be not far from me.
19:35:23:Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication, for my cause, my God and my Lord!
19:35:24:Judge me, O Lord my God, according to your righteousness; let them not rejoice over me.
19:35:25:Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha, just what we wanted!" Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."
19:35:26:May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.
19:35:27:Let those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and be glad; let them always say, "Great is the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant!"
19:35:28:Then my tongue will tell of your righteousness and sing of your praise all day long.
19:36:1:In the depths of their hearts, wicked people have no fear of God.
19:36:2:They flatter themselves in their own eyes, believing their sins will not be discovered and hated.
19:36:3:The words from their mouths are evil and deceitful; they have stopped doing what is wise and good.
19:36:4:Even as they lie in bed, they plot wickedness; they commit themselves to a sinful path and don't reject evil.
19:36:5:Lord, your unfailing love reaches to the heavens, and your faithfulness extends to the skies.
19:36:6:Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, and your judgments are as deep as the ocean. You save both humans and animals, O Lord.
19:36:7:How precious is your loving kindness, O God! People take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
19:36:8:They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from your river of delights.
19:36:9:For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
19:36:10:Continue your loving kindness to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright in heart.
19:36:11:Do not let the foot of arrogance come against me, nor let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19:36:12:There, evildoers have fallen; they are thrown down and unable to rise.
19:37:1:Do not be envious of wrongdoers, nor jealous of those who act unjustly.
19:37:2:For they will soon wither like the grass and fade away like green herbs.
19:37:3:Put your trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
19:37:4:Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will grant you the desires of your heart.
19:37:5:Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him, and He will act on your behalf.
19:37:6:He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday sun.
19:37:7:Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him; don't fret over those who prosper in their way or succeed in their wicked schemes.
19:37:8:Refrain from anger and turn away from wrath; do not worry—it only leads to evil.
19:37:9:For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord will inherit the land.
19:37:10:A little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.
19:37:11:But the meek will inherit the land and delight in abundant peace.
19:37:12:The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them,
19:37:13:but the Lord laughs at the wicked, knowing their day is coming.
19:37:14:The wicked draw their swords and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slaughter those whose ways are upright.
19:37:15:But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
19:37:16:Better is the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked.
19:37:17:For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
19:37:18:The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will endure forever.
19:37:19:In times of disaster they will not wither, and in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
19:37:20:But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord are like the glory of the meadows—they vanish, like smoke they fade away.
19:37:21:The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously.
19:37:22:Those blessed by the Lord will inherit the land, while those cursed by Him will be cut off.
19:37:23:The steps of a good person are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in their way.
19:37:24:Though they stumble, they will not fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.
19:37:25:I was young and now am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging for bread.
19:37:26:They are always generous and lend freely; their descendants will be a blessing.
19:37:27:Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.
19:37:28:For the Lord loves justice and will not forsake His faithful ones; they are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.
19:37:29:The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
19:37:30:The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and their tongue speaks what is just.
19:37:31:The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip.
19:37:32:The wicked watch the righteous, seeking to kill them.
19:37:33:But the Lord will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when they are judged.
19:37:34:Wait for the Lord and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
19:37:35:I have seen a wicked and ruthless person flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
19:37:36:but they soon passed away and were no more; though I looked for them, they could not be found.
19:37:37:Consider the blameless and observe the upright, for there is a future for the person of peace.
19:37:38:But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.
19:37:39:The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; He is their stronghold in times of trouble.
19:37:40:The Lord helps them and delivers them; He rescues them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in Him.
19:38:1:O Lord, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
19:38:2:Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and your hand presses down on me.
19:38:3:There is no soundness in my body due to your indignation; no peace in my bones because of my sin.
19:38:4:My iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh on me like a heavy burden, too much for me to bear.
19:38:5:My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.
19:38:6:I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go about mourning all day long.
19:38:7:My insides are filled with burning pain, and there is no health in my body.
19:38:8:I am weak and utterly crushed; I groan in the anguish of my heart.
19:38:9:Lord, you know all my desires; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19:38:10:My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light of my eyes has left me.
19:38:11:My friends and companions avoid me because of my affliction; my neighbors stay far away.
19:38:12:Those who seek my life set traps; those who desire my harm speak destruction and plot deceit all day long.
19:38:13:But I am like a deaf man, not hearing; like a mute, unable to speak.
19:38:14:I have become like one who does not hear, and in whose mouth there are no arguments.
19:38:15:For in you, O Lord, I put my trust; you will answer, O Lord my God.
19:38:16:I said, "Don't let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
19:38:17:I am about to fall, and my pain is always with me.
19:38:18:Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
19:38:19:Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; numerous are those who hate me without reason.
19:38:20:Those who repay evil for good slander me because I pursue what is good.
19:38:21:Do not abandon me, O Lord; my God, do not be far from me.
19:38:22:Hurry to help me, O Lord, my Savior.
19:39:1:I said to myself, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while the wicked are in my presence."
19:39:2:I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased;
19:39:3:my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
19:39:4:"Lord, make me aware of my end, and the measure of my days, so that I may know how fleeting my life is.
19:39:5:You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah
19:39:6:Man is merely a shadow, going about in vain; he accumulates wealth, not knowing who will receive it.
19:39:7:And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.
19:39:8:Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.
19:39:9:I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.
19:39:10:Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
19:39:11:When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth—surely everyone is but a breath. Selah
19:39:12:Hear my prayer, O Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
19:39:13:Spare me, that I may recover strength, before I depart and am no more."
19:40:1:I waited patiently for the Lord, and He turned to me and heard my cry.
19:40:2:He lifted me out of a horrible pit, from the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
19:40:3:He placed a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.
19:40:4:Blessed is the person who places their trust in the Lord, and doesn't turn to the proud or those who follow lies.
19:40:5:O Lord my God, you have done many wondrous deeds, and your thoughts toward us are beyond counting. If I were to declare and speak of them, they would be too numerous to count.
19:40:6:Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
19:40:7:Then I said, "Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written about me.
19:40:8:I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."
19:40:9:I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness in the great assembly; indeed, I have not restrained my lips, O Lord, you know.
19:40:10:I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your steadfast love and your truth from the great assembly.
19:40:11:Do not withhold your mercy from me, O Lord; let your steadfast love and your truth continually protect me.
19:40:12:For countless evils surround me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.
19:40:13:Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; hurry to help me, O Lord.
19:40:14:Let those who seek to destroy my life be put to shame and confusion; let them be turned back and humiliated who delight in my hurt.
19:40:15:Let those who say to me, "Aha, aha!" be appalled because of their shame.
19:40:16:But let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation continually say, "Great is the Lord!"
19:40:17:Though I am poor and needy, the Lord thinks of me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God.
19:41:1:Blessed are those who consider the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver them in times of trouble.
19:41:2:The Lord will protect and preserve them; they will be called blessed on earth. He won't give them up to the desires of their enemies.
19:41:3:The Lord will strengthen them when they're sick; He will restore them to health from their illness.
19:41:4:I said, "Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."
19:41:5:My enemies speak evil about me, asking, "When will he die, and his name perish?"
19:41:6:When they visit me, they talk insincerely; they gather lies in their hearts and spread them after leaving.
19:41:7:All who hate me whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me.
19:41:8:They say, "A deadly disease has taken hold of him; he'll never rise from his bed again."
19:41:9:Even my closest friend, whom I trusted, who shared meals with me, has turned against me.
19:41:10:But Lord, be gracious to me and raise me up, so I can repay them.
19:41:11:By this, I know that You favor me: my enemy doesn't triumph over me.
19:41:12:In my integrity, You uphold me; You set me in Your presence forever.
19:41:13:Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
19:42:1:As a deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God.
19:42:2:My soul thirsts for God, the living God; when will I come and appear before him?
19:42:3:Tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me continually, "Where is your God?"
19:42:4:Remembering these things, I pour out my soul within me: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.
19:42:5:Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19:42:6:My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, and the heights of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
19:42:7:Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.
19:42:8:By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me—a prayer to the God of my life.
19:42:9:I will say to God my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"
19:42:10:With a broken heart, my bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19:42:11:Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19:43:1:Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from deceitful and unjust people.
19:43:2:For you are the God of my refuge; why have you forsaken me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?
19:43:3:Send forth your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.
19:43:4:Then I will approach the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy; and I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.
19:43:5:Why are you downcast, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
19:44:1:We have heard with our ears, O God; our ancestors have told us the great deeds you performed in their days, in days long ago.
19:44:2:You drove out the nations with your hand, and planted our ancestors in their place; you crushed the peoples and made them spread.
19:44:3:It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.
19:44:4:You are my King and my God, who commands victories for Jacob.
19:44:5:Through you we push back our enemies; in your name we trample our foes.
19:44:6:I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;
19:44:7:But you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.
19:44:8:In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever.
19:44:9:But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.
19:44:10:You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.
19:44:11:You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.
19:44:12:You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.
19:44:13:You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.
19:44:14:You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.
19:44:15:I live in disgrace all day long, and my face is covered with shame
19:44:16:At the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.
19:44:17:All this came upon us, though we had not forgotten you; we had not been false to your covenant.
19:44:18:Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.
19:44:19:But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; you covered us over with deep darkness.
19:44:20:If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19:44:21:Would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?
19:44:22:Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
19:44:23:Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
19:44:24:Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?
19:44:25:We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
19:44:26:Rise up and help us; rescue us because of your unfailing love.
19:45:1:My heart overflows with a beautiful theme; I compose my song for the king, like a skilled poet.
19:45:2:You are the most handsome of all men; grace flows from your lips. Therefore, God has blessed you forever.
19:45:3:Strap on your sword, O mighty warrior, adorned with your splendor and majesty.
19:45:4:In your majesty, ride forth victoriously for the cause of truth, humility, and justice; let your right hand display awesome deeds.
19:45:5:Your arrows are sharp, piercing the hearts of your enemies; nations fall beneath your feet.
19:45:6:Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever; a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
19:45:7:You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your companions.
19:45:8:All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory, the music of strings delights you.
19:45:9:Kings' daughters are among your honored women; at your right hand stands the queen, adorned in gold from Ophir.
19:45:10:Listen, O daughter, consider and incline your ear; forget your people and your father's house.
19:45:11:The king is captivated by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.
19:45:12:The people of Tyre will come with gifts; the wealthy will seek your favor.
19:45:13:The princess is glorious within her chamber; her gown is interwoven with gold.
19:45:14:In embroidered garments, she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow, brought to you.
19:45:15:With joy and gladness, they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
19:45:16:Your sons will succeed your ancestors; you will make them rulers throughout the land.
19:45:17:I will commemorate your name for all generations; therefore, nations will praise you forever and ever.
19:46:1:God is our refuge and strength, a helper always near in times of trouble.
19:46:2:Therefore, we won't be afraid, even if the earth shakes or mountains crumble into the sea.
19:46:3:Let the oceans roar and foam; let the mountains tremble as the waters surge. We will not fear.
19:46:4:There's a river whose streams bring joy to the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
19:46:5:God is within her, she will not fall; He will help her at the break of day.
19:46:6:Nations rage and kingdoms fall, but when God speaks, the earth melts away.
19:46:7:The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
19:46:8:Come, see the works of the Lord, who brings devastation upon the earth.
19:46:9:He puts an end to wars all over the world; He breaks the bow, shatters the spear, and burns the chariots with fire.
19:46:10:Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth.
19:46:11:The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
19:47:1:Clap your hands, everyone! Shout joyfully to God with a loud voice!
19:47:2:For the Lord Most High is awe-inspiring; He's the great King over all the earth.
19:47:3:He subdues nations under us and puts peoples beneath our feet.
19:47:4:He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loves. Selah
19:47:5:God has ascended with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
19:47:6:Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.
19:47:7:For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.
19:47:8:God reigns over the nations; He sits on His holy throne.
19:47:9:The leaders of the people gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted. FINISHED
19:48:1:Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, on His holy mountain.
19:48:2:Beautiful and majestic, the joy of all the earth, is Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.
19:48:3:Within her citadels, God has shown Himself a sure defense.
19:48:4:For behold, the kings assembled; they came together advancing.
19:48:5:As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they fled in terror.
19:48:6:Trembling took hold of them there, like the pain of childbirth.
19:48:7:With an east wind, You shatter the ships of Tarshish.
19:48:8:As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it forever. Selah
19:48:9:We have thought on Your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
19:48:10:As Your name, O God, so Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
19:48:11:Let Mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Your judgments.
19:48:12:Walk around Zion, go all around it, count its towers,
19:48:13:consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation.
19:48:14:For this is God, our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end. FINISHED
19:49:1:Hear this, everyone! Listen up, people from every corner of the earth,
19:49:2:Both the rich and the poor, all together, no matter your status.
19:49:3:I will share wisdom with you, my thoughts are filled with understanding.
19:49:4:I'll turn my ear to a wise saying, unraveling riddles with the sound of the harp.
19:49:5:Why should I be afraid in times of trouble, when the wicked surround me with their schemes?
19:49:6:Those who trust in their wealth, boasting about their great riches,
19:49:7:No one can buy their own redemption, or pay a price for the life of another,
19:49:8:Because the cost of a life is too high, and no payment can ever suffice.
19:49:9:They won't live forever, avoiding the grave and decay.
19:49:10:Even the wise die, just like the foolish and senseless, leaving their wealth behind.
19:49:11:They believe their homes will last forever, naming lands after themselves.
19:49:12:But despite their honor, they won't endure; they're like animals that perish.
19:49:13:This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, followed by those who approve of their ways.
19:49:14:Like sheep, they're led to the grave, where death will be their shepherd. The righteous will rule over them in the morning, and their bodies will rot in the grave, far from their grand estates.
19:49:15:But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for He will take me to Himself.
19:49:16:Don't be afraid when someone becomes rich, when the glory of their house increases.
19:49:17:For when they die, they take nothing with them; their wealth won't follow them into the grave.
19:49:18:Though they consider themselves blessed in life, and people praise them for their success,
19:49:19:They will join their ancestors who've already died, never again seeing the light.
19:49:20:A person who has wealth but lacks understanding is like the animals that perish.
19:50:1:The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
19:50:2:From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
19:50:3:Our God approaches, not keeping silent; a devouring fire precedes Him, and around Him a powerful storm rages.
19:50:4:He calls to the heavens above and the earth below, so that He may judge His people:
19:50:5:"Gather to Me My faithful ones, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."
19:50:6:The heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah.
19:50:7:"Listen, My people, and I will speak; Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
19:50:8:I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are always before Me.
19:50:9:I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens,
19:50:10:For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.
19:50:11:I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are Mine.
19:50:12:If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you, for the world and everything in it is Mine.
19:50:13:Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19:50:14:Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and fulfill your vows to the Most High.
19:50:15:Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me."
19:50:16:But to the wicked, God says, "What right do you have to recite My statutes or take My covenant on your lips?
19:50:17:You hate instruction and cast My words behind you.
19:50:18:When you see a thief, you befriend him, and you associate with adulterers.
19:50:19:You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue devises deceit.
19:50:20:You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.
19:50:21:These things you have done, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But now I rebuke you and set the record straight before your eyes.
19:50:22:Consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there is no one to rescue you.
19:50:23:He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me, and to the one who orders his way rightly, I will show the salvation of God."
19:51:1:Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love; according to the greatness of your compassion, wipe away my wrongdoings.
19:51:2:Thoroughly cleanse me from my guilt, and wash away my sin.
19:51:3:I know my transgressions well, and my sin is always before me.
19:51:4:Against you alone have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight. You are right when you speak and justified when you judge.
19:51:5:Indeed, I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
19:51:6:You desire truth in my inner being; teach me wisdom deep within my heart.
19:51:7:Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
19:51:8:Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
19:51:9:Hide your face from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.
19:51:10:Create a pure heart in me, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19:51:11:Do not cast me away from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
19:51:12:Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
19:51:13:Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
19:51:14:Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
19:51:15:O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
19:51:16:You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
19:51:17:The sacrifices you desire are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
19:51:18:In your kindness, do good to Zion; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
19:51:19:Then you will be pleased with righteous sacrifices, burnt offerings, and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19:52:1:Why do you boast of your evil deeds, mighty one? God's faithful love is with us always.
19:52:2:Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, crafting deceit.
19:52:3:You prefer evil over good, lies rather than speaking truth.
19:52:4:You delight in harmful words, deceitful language.
19:52:5:But God will bring you down forever; He will seize and uproot you from your home, removing you from the land of the living.
19:52:6:The righteous will see this and be awestruck; they will laugh at your downfall.
19:52:7:"Look at the person who did not rely on God for strength, but trusted in their wealth and wicked ways!"
19:52:8:As for me, I am like a flourishing olive tree in God's house; I trust in His unfailing love forever and ever.
19:52:9:I will praise You forever for what You have done; in Your name, I will put my hope, for it is good in the presence of Your faithful people.
19:53:1:The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and commit evil deeds; there is not one who does good.
19:53:2:God looks down from heaven upon humanity to see if there are any who understand, any who seek Him.
19:53:3:Everyone has turned away; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not even a single person.
19:53:4:Will those who do evil never learn? They devour my people as if eating bread; they never call on God.
19:53:5:They will be filled with terror, where there was no fear before, for God scatters the bones of those who attack you. You put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
19:53:6:Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
19:54:1:God, save me by your name, and defend me with your might.
19:54:2:Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
19:54:3:For strangers have risen against me, and ruthless men seek after my life; they do not set you before them.
19:54:4:Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is with those who support me.
19:54:5:He will repay evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness, destroy them.
19:54:6:Willingly I will sacrifice to you; I will praise your name, O Lord, for it is good.
19:54:7:For he has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has looked upon my enemies.
19:55:1:Listen, God, to my prayer; don't ignore my plea for help.
19:55:2:Pay attention and answer me; I am restless in my thoughts and troubled.
19:55:3:Because of the enemy's voice and the oppressor's pressure, they bring trouble upon me and angrily pursue me.
19:55:4:My heart is in anguish within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
19:55:5:Fear and trembling overwhelm me, and horror wraps itself around me.
19:55:6:I said, "If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
19:55:7:Indeed, I would flee far away; I would stay in the wilderness.
19:55:8:I would hurry to my place of shelter, safe from the stormy wind and tempest."
19:55:9:Destroy, O Lord, and confuse their tongues, for I see violence and strife in the city.
19:55:10:Day and night they prowl around its walls; evil and trouble are within it.
19:55:11:Destruction is at its core; oppression and deceit never leave its streets.
19:55:12:If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.
19:55:13:But it's you, a person like myself, my companion and close friend,
19:55:14:With whom I enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked together in the house of God.
19:55:15:Let death come suddenly upon them; let them go down alive into the grave, for evil resides in their homes and hearts.
19:55:16:As for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD will save me.
19:55:17:Evening, morning, and at noon I will cry out in distress, and He will hear my voice.
19:55:18:He will redeem me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
19:55:19:God, who is enthroned from of old, will hear and humble them—because they do not change and have no fear of God.
19:55:20:My companion attacks his friends; he breaks his promises.
19:55:21:His words are smooth as butter, but there's war in his heart; his words are soothing, yet they're drawn swords.
19:55:22:Cast your cares on the LORD, and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.
19:55:23:But You, O God, will bring the wicked down to the pit of destruction; bloodthirsty and deceitful people will not live out half their days. Yet I will trust in You.
19:56:1:In times of trouble, God, have mercy on me; for people are always trying to bring me down.
19:56:2:My enemies constantly harass me; they never let up in their pursuit to crush me.
19:56:3:But when I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
19:56:4:I praise God for his word; I trust him and will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?
19:56:5:They twist my words and plot against me all day long.
19:56:6:They gather together, lurking and watching my every move, eager to take my life.
19:56:7:Bring them down, O Lord, for their wickedness; in your anger, destroy these people.
19:56:8:You have recorded my wanderings; put my tears in your bottle—aren't they noted in your book?
19:56:9:When I cry out to you, my enemies will retreat; I know this because God is on my side.
19:56:10:In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise,
19:56:11:I trust in God and will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?
19:56:12:I am bound by my vows to you, O God; I will present my thanksgiving offerings to you.
19:56:13:For you have saved me from death and kept my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of life.
19:57:1:For the music leader, a tune of David when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy! I look to you for protection. I will hide in the shadow of your wings until the danger has passed.
19:57:2:I cry out to God Most High, who fulfills his purpose for me.
19:57:3:He sends help from heaven and saves me, putting to shame those who seek my life. God's faithful love and truth surround me.
19:57:4:I find myself surrounded by lions, fierce and hungry, their mouths filled with sharp teeth, like spears and arrows, their tongues like sharp swords.
19:57:5:O God, be exalted above the heavens; let your glory shine across the earth.
19:57:6:My enemies set a trap for me; they dug a pit in my path, but they fell into it themselves.
19:57:7:My heart is confident, O God, my heart is confident. I will sing and make music.
19:57:8:Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn with my song.
19:57:9:I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
19:57:10:For your unfailing love reaches to the heavens, and your faithfulness extends to the skies.
19:57:11:Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory cover the earth.
19:58:1:Do you rulers truly speak justly? Do you judge people fairly?
19:58:2:No, in your hearts you devise injustice; your hands spread violence throughout the land.
19:58:3:The wicked go astray from the womb; they err from birth, speaking lies.
19:58:4:Their venom is like that of a snake; they are like a deaf cobra that stops its ears.
19:58:5:It won't listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful the enchanter may be.
19:58:6:God, break their teeth in their mouths; shatter the fangs of these lions, O Lord!
19:58:7:Let them vanish like water flowing away; let them wither like trampled grass.
19:58:8:Let them be like a snail that dissolves into slime; like a stillborn child who never sees the sun.
19:58:9:Before the thorns can grow into a bush, may God sweep them away, both living and in his wrath.
19:58:10:The righteous will rejoice when they see vengeance done; they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
19:58:11:People will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; indeed, there is a God who judges on earth."
19:59:1: Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise against me.
19:59:2: Save me from evildoers and shield me from the violent.
19:59:3: For they lie in wait for my life; fierce men conspire against me, without reason or fault of mine.
19:59:4: Despite my innocence, they prepare to attack; wake up to help me, and see!
19:59:5: You, Lord God of hosts, God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. 
19:59:6: They return at evening, snarling like dogs, prowling around the city.
19:59:7: Listen to their words, for they are full of threats and curses, and they think, "Who can hear us?"
19:59:8: But you, Lord, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations.
19:59:9: O my Strength, I watch for you; for you, O God, are my fortress.
19:59:10: My loving God will go before me; he will let me look upon my enemies in triumph.
19:59:11: Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by your power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
19:59:12: For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride; for the cursing and lies they utter.
19:59:13: Consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more, that people may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth.
19:59:14: And at evening let them return, let them snarl like dogs and prowl around the city.
19:59:15: They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill.
19:59:16: But I will sing of your strength, and in the morning proclaim your steadfast love; for you have been my fortress and refuge in the day of my trouble.
19:59:17: To you, O my Strength, I will sing praises; for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.
19:60:1:God, you have rejected us and broken our defenses; you have been angry, but now restore us.
19:60:2:You made the earth shake and split apart; heal its fractures, for it is trembling.
19:60:3:You have made your people suffer hardship; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
19:60:4:But now you have raised a banner for those who fear you, to rally to it in the face of the enemy.
19:60:5:Save us with your right hand and answer us, so that your beloved may be delivered.
19:60:6:God has spoken from his sanctuary: "I will triumph; I will divide Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth.
19:60:7:Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, and Judah is my scepter.
19:60:8:Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19:60:9:Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19:60:10:Is it not you, God, who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
19:60:11:Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.
19:60:12:With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
19:61:1:Hear my cry, O God; pay attention to my prayer.
19:61:2:From the ends of the earth I call out to You when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
19:61:3:For You have been a refuge for me, a strong tower against the enemy.
19:61:4:I will dwell in Your shelter forever; I will take refuge under the cover of Your wings. Selah
19:61:5:For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have granted the heritage of those who fear Your name.
19:61:6:Add days to the life of the king; may his years endure through many generations.
19:61:7:May he sit enthroned before God forever; appoint Your steadfast love and faithfulness to protect him.
19:61:8:So I will sing praise to Your name forever, as I fulfill my vows day after day. FINISHED
19:62:1:In God alone, my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.
19:62:2:He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
19:62:3:How long will you attack a person? Will you all try to bring him down, like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?
19:62:4:They plan to topple him from his high position; they delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. 
19:62:5:Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
19:62:6:He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
19:62:7:My salvation and honor depend on God; He is my mighty rock and refuge.
19:62:8:Trust in Him at all times, people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge.
19:62:9:Surely the lowborn are but a breath, and the highborn are a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.
19:62:10:Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
19:62:11:One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: Power belongs to God,
19:62:12:and unfailing love, O Lord, is Yours. You reward everyone according to what they have done.
19:63:1:God, you are my God; I eagerly seek you. My soul thirsts for you, and my body longs for you in this dry and weary land where there is no water.
19:63:2:I have seen your power and glory in the sanctuary, and it has left me in awe.
19:63:3:Your steadfast love is better than life itself, and so my lips will praise you.
19:63:4:As long as I live, I will bless you, lifting up my hands in your name.
19:63:5:My soul is satisfied as with a rich feast, and my mouth praises you with joyful lips.
19:63:6:When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you through the night watches.
19:63:7:For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings, I sing for joy.
19:63:8:My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
19:63:9:Those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth.
19:63:10:They will be given over to the sword and become prey for jackals.
19:63:11:But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be silenced.
19:64:1:Listen, God, to my voice when I complain; protect my life from the enemy's terror.
19:64:2:Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the schemes of evildoers.
19:64:3:For they sharpen their tongues like swords and aim bitter words like arrows,
19:64:4:Shooting from ambush at the innocent, attacking suddenly and fearlessly.
19:64:5:They encourage each other in evil plans, talking about setting traps and saying, "Who will see us?"
19:64:6:They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
19:64:7:But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will be struck down suddenly.
19:64:8:Their own tongues will bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
19:64:9:Everyone will fear and proclaim the work of God, reflecting on what he has done.
19:64:10:The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will praise him.
19:65:1:Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.
19:65:2:Hearer of prayer, all people will come to you.
19:65:3:When sins overwhelm us, you forgive them.
19:65:4:Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
19:65:5:With awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
19:65:6:By your power, you established the mountains; you are clothed with strength.
19:65:7:You silence the roaring of the seas, the tumult of their waves, and the uproar of the nations.
19:65:8:Those living at the ends of the earth stand in awe of your wonders. From where the sun rises to where it sets, you inspire shouts of joy.
19:65:9:You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The river of God is full of water; you provide the people with grain, for so you have prepared it.
19:65:10:You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
19:65:11:You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
19:65:12:The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.
19:65:13:The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
19:66:1:Shout joyfully to God, all the earth!
19:66:2:Sing about the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.
19:66:3:Tell everyone, "How awesome are Your works! Because of Your great power, Your enemies cringe before You."
19:66:4:All the earth worships You and sings praises to You; they sing praises to Your name."
19:66:5:Come and see the amazing works of God; His deeds among people inspire awe.
19:66:6:He turned the sea into dry land; they crossed the river on foot. Let's celebrate Him together!
19:66:7:He rules forever by His power; His eyes watch over the nations. Don't let the rebellious rise against Him.
19:66:8:Bless our God, you peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.
19:66:9:He has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.
19:66:10:For You, O God, have tested us; You refined us like silver.
19:66:11:You brought us into a net; You laid burdens on our backs.
19:66:12:You let others ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us to a place of abundance.
19:66:13:I will come into Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You,
19:66:14:the vows my lips uttered and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.
19:66:15:I will offer You fat animals as burnt offerings, along with the smoke of rams; I will sacrifice bulls and goats.
19:66:16:Come and listen, all who fear God; let me tell you what He has done for me.
19:66:17:I cried out to Him with my mouth; His praise was on my tongue.
19:66:18:If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;
19:66:19:but God has surely heard me and paid attention to my prayer.
19:66:20:Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld His love from me!
19:67:1:May God be gracious to us and bless us; may His face shine upon us,
19:67:2:So that Your way is known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
19:67:3:Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.
19:67:4:Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for You judge the peoples fairly and guide the nations on earth.
19:67:5:The people shall give You praise, O God; all the people shall give You praise.
19:67:6:The earth has yielded its harvest; God, our God, has blessed us.
19:67:7:God has blessed us; let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
19:68:1:May God arise and scatter his enemies; let those who oppose him flee from his presence.
19:68:2:As smoke vanishes, so may they vanish; as wax melts before fire, let the wicked perish in the presence of God.
19:68:3:But let the righteous be joyful; let them celebrate before God with gladness and joy.
19:68:4:Sing to God, sing praises to his name; exalt the one who rides upon the clouds—his name is the Lord—and rejoice in his presence.
19:68:5:Father of orphans and protector of widows is God in his holy dwelling.
19:68:6:He provides homes for the lonely and leads prisoners to freedom; but rebellious individuals live in a parched land.
19:68:7:God, when you led your people out, when you marched through the wilderness,
19:68:8:The earth shook, and the heavens poured down rain in the presence of God, the God of Sinai, in the presence of God, the God of Israel.
19:68:9:You sent abundant rain, O God, to refresh your weary inheritance.
19:68:10:Your people settled there, and you provided for the poor from your goodness, O God.
19:68:11:The Lord gave the command, and a great company of women proclaimed the good news:
19:68:12:"Kings and their armies are fleeing, they are fleeing!" While dividing the spoil,
19:68:13:Though you had been among the sheepfolds, you will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its feathers with shimmering gold.
19:68:14:When the Almighty scattered the kings, it was like snow falling on Mount Zalmon.
19:68:15:Bashan's mountain range is a towering mass, a high and majestic mountain.
19:68:16:Why do you look with envy, O high mountains, at the mountain God chose for his dwelling, where the Lord will reside forever?
19:68:17:The chariots of God are tens of thousands, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them as he was at Sinai, in his holy place.
19:68:18:You ascended on high, leading captives in your train, receiving gifts from people, even from the rebellious, so that the Lord God may dwell among them.
19:68:19:Praise be to the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, the God who is our salvation.
19:68:20:Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death.
19:68:21:Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who persist in their sins.
19:68:22:The Lord has said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
19:68:23:So that you may dip your feet in blood, and the tongues of your dogs may have their share of the enemy."
19:68:24:Your procession, O God, has come into view, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
19:68:25:Singers lead the way, followed by musicians; among them are young women playing tambourines.
19:68:26:Praise God in the great congregation; praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
19:68:27:There is Benjamin, the youngest, leading them; followed by the princes of Judah in their royal robes, the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.
19:68:28:Summon your power, O God; show us your strength, O God, as you have done before.
19:68:29:Because of your temple in Jerusalem, kings will bring gifts to you.
19:68:30:Rebuke the wild animals that dwell among the reeds, the herds of bulls with the calves of the nations. Humble those who delight in war.
19:68:31:Let bronze be brought from Egypt; let Ethiopia stretch out its hands to God.
19:68:32:Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord,
19:68:33:To him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient skies; listen, he thunders with his mighty voice.
19:68:34:Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies.
19:68:35:You are awesome, O God, in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!
19:69:1:Save me, O God, for the waters have risen up to my neck.
19:69:2:I'm sinking in deep mire, where there's no solid ground; I've come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
19:69:3:I'm worn out from crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
19:69:4:Those who hate me without cause outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies who would destroy me, though I've done nothing wrong. What I haven't stolen, must I now restore?
19:69:5:God, you know my foolishness, and my guilt is not hidden from you.
19:69:6:May those who hope in you not be ashamed because of me, Lord GOD of Hosts; may those who seek you not be disgraced because of me, God of Israel.
19:69:7:For your sake, I've endured scorn; shame covers my face.
19:69:8:I've become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's children.
19:69:9:Zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
19:69:10:When I weep and fast, I endure ridicule.
19:69:11:When I put on sackcloth, people make fun of me.
19:69:12:Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me, and drunkards mock me in their songs.
19:69:13:But as for me, my prayer is to you, LORD, at an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love, answer me with your sure salvation.
19:69:14:Rescue me from the mire, so I won't sink; let me be delivered from my enemies and the deep waters.
19:69:15:Don't let the floodwaters overwhelm me, nor the depths swallow me up, nor the pit close its mouth over me.
19:69:16:Hear me, LORD, for your loving-kindness is good; turn to me in your abundant mercy.
19:69:17:Do not hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress; answer me quickly.
19:69:18:Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes.
19:69:19:You know the insults and shame I endure—my adversaries are all before you.
19:69:20:Insults have broken my heart, and I am weak; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but found none.
19:69:21:They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
19:69:22:Let their table become a snare before them, and their well-being a trap.
19:69:23:May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
19:69:24:Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
19:69:25:May their camp be desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.
19:69:26:For they persecute those you've struck down, and they talk about the pain of those you've wounded.
19:69:27:Add guilt to their guilt; let them not come into your righteousness.
19:69:28:May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.
19:69:29:But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high.
19:69:30:I will praise the name of God with a song, and I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
19:69:31:This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.
19:69:32:The humble will see and be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
19:69:33:For the LORD hears the needy and does not despise his own who are prisoners.
19:69:34:Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.
19:69:35:For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; they shall dwell there and possess it.
19:69:36:The offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it.
19:70:1:God, come quickly to save me! Lord, hurry to help me!
19:70:2:Let those who want to harm me be put to shame and confusion; let them be turned back and humiliated, those who desire my downfall.
19:70:3:May those who mock me be taken aback by their own disgrace, as they jeer, "Aha, aha!"
19:70:4:But let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation always say, "Praise God!"
19:70:5:As for me, I am poor and needy; please hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, don't delay.
19:71:1:In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame.
19:71:2:Rescue me and set me free in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me.
19:71:3:Be my rock of refuge, where I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my fortress and stronghold.
19:71:4:My God, deliver me from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of those who are unjust and cruel.
19:71:5:For you are my hope, O Lord God, my confidence since I was young.
19:71:6:I have relied on you from birth; you have been my protector from my mother's womb. I will always praise you.
19:71:7:Many are astonished by me, but you are my strong refuge.
19:71:8:My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.
19:71:9:Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
19:71:10:For my enemies speak against me; those who watch for my life conspire together.
19:71:11:They say, "God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him."
19:71:12:O God, do not be far from me; my God, come quickly to help me.
19:71:13:May my accusers perish in disgrace; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and dishonor.
19:71:14:But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.
19:71:15:My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, of your saving acts all day long—though I know not how to relate them all.
19:71:16:I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign Lord; I will praise your righteousness, yours alone.
19:71:17:God, you have taught me from my youth, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
19:71:18:Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.
19:71:19:Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; you have done great things. Who is like you, O God?
19:71:20:You, who have shown me many troubles and distresses, will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
19:71:21:You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.
19:71:22:I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
19:71:23:My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you; I, whom you have redeemed.
19:71:24:My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
19:72:1:God, give your justice to the king and your righteousness to the royal son.
19:72:2:May he judge your people fairly and show compassion to the poor.
19:72:3:Let the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills, through righteousness.
19:72:4:He will defend the cause of the poor, save the children of those in need, and crush the oppressor.
19:72:5:They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
19:72:6:Like rain falling on a freshly cut field, or showers watering the earth, may he come down.
19:72:7:In his days, let the righteous flourish and peace abound until the moon is no more.
19:72:8:May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
19:72:9:Desert tribes will bow before him, and his enemies will lick the dust.
19:72:10:The kings of Tarshish and distant shores will bring tribute; the kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts.
19:72:11:All kings will bow down to him, and all nations will serve him.
19:72:12:For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.
19:72:13:He will have pity on the weak and the needy, saving the lives of the poor.
19:72:14:From oppression and violence, he redeems their lives, and precious is their blood in his sight.
19:72:15:Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given to him. Let people always pray for him and bless him all day long.
19:72:16:May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway on the tops of the hills. May its fruit flourish like Lebanon, and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field.
19:72:17:May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.
19:72:18:Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
19:72:19:Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
19:72:20:The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended.
19:73:1:God is truly good to those who are pure in heart.
19:73:2:But as for me, my feet almost slipped; I nearly lost my footing.
19:73:3:For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19:73:4:They seem to have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.
19:73:5:They don't experience the troubles others do; they're not plagued by human pain.
19:73:6:So pride becomes their necklace, and violence covers them like a garment.
19:73:7:Their eyes bulge with abundance; they possess more than their hearts could wish for.
19:73:8:They scoff and speak maliciously; from their high position, they threaten oppression.
19:73:9:With mouths set against heaven, their tongues strut across the earth.
19:73:10:That's why people turn to them and drink up their words like water.
19:73:11:And they say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"
19:73:12:Behold, these are the wicked; always carefree, they increase in wealth.
19:73:13:In vain have I kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.
19:73:14:For all day long, I've been afflicted and chastened every morning.
19:73:15:If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.
19:73:16:When I tried to understand this, it was too difficult for me,
19:73:17:Until I entered God's sanctuary and discerned their end.
19:73:18:You surely set them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
19:73:19:How suddenly they are destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
19:73:20:Like a dream when one awakes, Lord, you'll despise their image when you arise.
19:73:21:When my heart was embittered and I felt a sting in my mind,
19:73:22:I was senseless and ignorant; like a beast, I was before you.
19:73:23:Nevertheless, I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
19:73:24:You guide me with your counsel, and afterward, you will take me into glory.
19:73:25:Whom do I have in heaven but you? And there's nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
19:73:26:My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19:73:27:For those far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
19:73:28:But for me, it is good to be near God; I've made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
19:74:1:God, why have You abandoned us? Your anger smolders against the sheep of Your pasture.
19:74:2:Remember the community You purchased long ago, the tribe You redeemed as Your own inheritance, and Mount Zion where You dwell.
19:74:3:Turn Your steps toward the perpetual ruins; the enemy has caused destruction in the sanctuary.
19:74:4:Your adversaries roared within Your meeting place; they set up their banners as signs of victory.
19:74:5:They seemed like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.
19:74:6:Now they smash all the carved work with hammers and axes.
19:74:7:They've set Your sanctuary on fire; they've desecrated the dwelling place of Your Name, reducing it to rubble.
19:74:8:They said in their hearts, "Let's destroy them completely." They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
19:74:9:We no longer see miraculous signs; there are no prophets left, and none of us knows how long this will last.
19:74:10:How long, O God, will the enemy mock You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?
19:74:11:Why do You hold back Your hand? Stretch out Your right hand from on high and put an end to this.
19:74:12:Yet God is my King from long ago; He brings salvation upon the earth.
19:74:13:You split open the sea by Your power; You broke the heads of the monsters in the waters.
19:74:14:You crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.
19:74:15:You opened up springs and streams; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
19:74:16:The day is Yours, and Yours also the night; You established the sun and moon.
19:74:17:You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made both summer and winter.
19:74:18:Remember how the enemy has mocked You, Lord, how foolish people have reviled Your name.
19:74:19:Do not hand over the life of Your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted people forever.
19:74:20:Consider the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of violence.
19:74:21:Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise Your name.
19:74:22:Rise up, O God, and defend Your cause; remember how the fools mock You all day long.
19:74:23:Do not ignore the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of those who rise against You, which goes on continually.
19:75:1:We give thanks to you, O God, for your name is near. People everywhere tell of your wondrous deeds.
19:75:2:When the time is right, I will judge fairly and with justice.
19:75:3:The earth and all its inhabitants may shake, but I hold its pillars firm.
19:75:4:I say to the boastful, "Do not boast," and to the wicked, "Do not lift up your horn."
19:75:5:Don't raise your horn on high or speak with arrogance and defiance.
19:75:6:For exaltation comes neither from the east nor the west, nor from the desert.
19:75:7:It is God who judges; he brings one down and lifts another up.
19:75:8:In the Lord's hand is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to the very last drop.
19:75:9:As for me, I will always declare the goodness of God; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19:75:10:He will cut off the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
19:76:1:God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
19:76:2:In Salem, His dwelling place, and in Zion, His abode.
19:76:3:There He broke the flaming arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
19:76:4:You are radiant and majestic, more than the everlasting mountains.
19:76:5:The brave-hearted were plundered; they sank into deep sleep, and none of the warriors could lift a hand.
19:76:6:At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lay still.
19:76:7:You alone are to be feared; who can stand before You when You are angry?
19:76:8:From heaven, You pronounced judgment, and the earth was terrified and quiet
19:76:9:when You, O God, arose to judge, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
19:76:10:Even human wrath will praise You; with the remnants of wrath, You will clothe Yourself.
19:76:11:Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; let all around Him bring tribute to the One who inspires awe.
19:76:12:He cuts off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
19:77:1:I cried out to God for help; I pleaded with Him in my distress.
19:77:2:In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord; at night, my hands were lifted up without growing weary; my soul refused comfort.
19:77:3:When I thought of God, I became troubled; as I pondered, my spirit was overwhelmed. 
19:77:4:You held my eyes open; I was too troubled to speak.
19:77:5:I considered the days of old, the years long past.
19:77:6:I remembered my songs in the night; I meditated within my heart, and my spirit searched diligently.
19:77:7:Will the Lord reject us forever? Will He never show His favor again?
19:77:8:Has His lovingkindness vanished forever? Has His promise failed for all generations?
19:77:9:Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He, in anger, withheld His compassion?
19:77:10:Then I said, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed."
19:77:11:I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will recall your wonders of old.
19:77:12:I will meditate on all your works and consider your mighty deeds.
19:77:13:Your way, O God, is holy; what god is as great as our God?
19:77:14:You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.
19:77:15:With your mighty arm, you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
19:77:16:The waters saw you, O God; they saw you and writhed; the depths trembled.
19:77:17:The clouds poured out water; the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.
19:77:18:Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind; your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
19:77:19:Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters, but your footprints were unseen.
19:77:20:You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19:78:1:Listen, everyone, to my teaching; pay attention to the words I speak.
19:78:2:I will share wisdom in the form of stories; I will reveal hidden truths from long ago.
19:78:3:We've heard these things from our ancestors, and we'll pass them on to future generations.
19:78:4:We won't hide these truths from our children; we'll tell them about the Lord's power and the wonders he has done.
19:78:5:God established laws for Jacob and gave instructions to Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children.
19:78:6:So that the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, who would then teach their own children.
19:78:7:In this way, they would put their trust in God, never forgetting his deeds and always obeying his commands.
19:78:8:They wouldn't be like their ancestors—stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful, with hearts that were not loyal to God and spirits unwilling to obey him.
19:78:9:The warriors of Ephraim, armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle.
19:78:10:They didn't keep their covenant with God and refused to follow his teachings.
19:78:11:They forgot the miracles he performed and the wonders he had shown them.
19:78:12:He did amazing things in Egypt, right before their ancestors in the region of Zoan.
19:78:13:He divided the sea, leading them through; he made the waters stand up like walls.
19:78:14:By day, he guided them with a cloud, and by night, with a light from the fire.
19:78:15:He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas.
19:78:16:He brought streams from the rock and made water flow like rivers.
19:78:17:Yet they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
19:78:18:They deliberately tested God, demanding the food they craved.
19:78:19:They spoke against God, saying, "Can he really provide food in the wilderness?
19:78:20:True, he struck the rock and water gushed out, but can he also give us bread and meat?"
19:78:21:Hearing this, the Lord became angry; his wrath was kindled against Jacob, and his anger rose against Israel.
19:78:22:For they did not believe in God or trust in his ability to save them.
19:78:23:But he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven.
19:78:24:He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them the grain of heaven.
19:78:25:Mortals ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
19:78:26:He stirred up the east wind in the heavens and guided the south wind by his power.
19:78:27:He rained meat on them like dust and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
19:78:28:He let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
19:78:29:So they ate and were well-filled, for he gave them what they desired.
19:78:30:But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
19:78:31:God's anger rose against them, and he killed the strongest among them and struck down Israel's young men.
19:78:32:In spite of all this, they kept on sinning and did not believe in his wonders.
19:78:33:So he brought their days to an end like a breath and their years in sudden terror.
19:78:34:When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and earnestly sought God.
19:78:35:They remembered that God was their rock and the Most High their redeemer.
19:78:36:But they deceived him with their words and lied to him with their actions.
19:78:37:Their hearts were not loyal to him, and they did not keep his covenant.
19:78:38:Yet he was compassionate; he forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. Time and again, he held back his anger and did not unleash his full wrath.
19:78:39:He remembered that they were only flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
19:78:40:How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland!
19:78:41:Again and again, they tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
19:78:42:They did not remember his power or the day he redeemed them from their oppressor,
19:78:43:When he performed his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the region of Zoan.
19:78:44:He turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink from their streams.
19:78:45:He sent swarms of flies to devour them and frogs to ruin them.
19:78:46:He gave their crops to the locusts and the fruit of their labor to the grasshoppers.
19:78:47:He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost.
19:78:48:He gave their cattle over to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.
19:78:49:He unleashed his burning anger against them, fury, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels.
19:78:50:He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but handed their lives over to the plague.
19:78:51:He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
19:78:52:But he led his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
19:78:53:He led them safely, and they were not afraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
19:78:54:He brought them to his holy land, to the mountain his right hand had won.
19:78:55:He drove out nations before them and allotted their inheritance by measurement, making the tribes of Israel settle in their tents.
19:78:56:But they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his decrees.
19:78:57:They turned back and were faithless like their ancestors; they were unreliable, like a faulty bow.
19:78:58:They angered him with their high places and aroused his jealousy with their idols.
19:78:59:When God heard them, he was furious and rejected Israel completely.
19:78:60:He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among humans.
19:78:61:He allowed the ark of his might to be captured and handed it over to his enemies.
19:78:62:He gave his people over to the sword and was angry with his inheritance.
19:78:63:Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs.
19:78:64:Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
19:78:65:Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a warrior overcome by wine.
19:78:66:He beat back his enemies and put them to everlasting shame.
19:78:67:He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
19:78:68:Instead, he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
19:78:69:He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
19:78:70:He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;
19:78:71:From tending the sheep, he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.
19:78:72:And David shepherded them with integrity of heart and guided them with skillful hands.
19:79:1:O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they've defiled your holy temple and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
19:79:2:They've given the dead bodies of your servants as food for birds, and the flesh of your faithful to wild animals.
19:79:3:Their blood has been poured out like water around Jerusalem, and there's no one left to bury them.
19:79:4:We've become a reproach to our neighbors, a laughingstock and scorn to those around us.
19:79:5:How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
19:79:6:Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, and on the kingdoms that don't call on your name.
19:79:7:For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste to his dwelling place.
19:79:8:Do not hold past iniquities against us; let your compassion come quickly, for we are brought very low.
19:79:9:Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.
19:79:10:Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of your servants' blood be known among the nations before our eyes.
19:79:11:May the groans of the prisoners reach you; according to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to die.
19:79:12:Pay back our neighbors sevenfold for the reproach they have hurled at you, Lord.
19:79:13:Then we, your people and the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation, we will declare your praise.
19:80:1:Listen to us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth.
19:80:2:Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, awaken your might and come to save us.
19:80:3:Restore us, O God; let your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.
19:80:4:O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?
19:80:5:You have fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink tears in great measure.
19:80:6:You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
19:80:7:Bring us back, O God of hosts; let your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.
19:80:8:You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
19:80:9:You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
19:80:10:The mountains were covered by its shadow, and the mighty cedars by its branches.
19:80:11:It sent out its boughs to the Sea, and its shoots to the River.
19:80:12:Why have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
19:80:13:The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
19:80:14:Turn again, O God of hosts; look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,
19:80:15:The stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.
19:80:16:They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!
19:80:17:But let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself.
19:80:18:Then we will not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name.
19:80:19:Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; let your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.
19:81:1:Sing joyfully to God, our strength; raise a shout for the God of Jacob.
19:81:2:Begin the music and strike the tambourine; play melodious tunes with the harp and lyre.
19:81:3:Sound the trumpet at the new moon and full moon, during our festive gatherings.
19:81:4:For this is a statute for Israel, a law given by the God of Jacob.
19:81:5:He established it as a testimony in Joseph when he went out against Egypt, where we heard a language we did not understand.
19:81:6:I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from carrying the load.
19:81:7:You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
19:81:8:Hear me, my people, and I will admonish you; if only you would listen to me, Israel!
19:81:9:There shall be no foreign god among you; you shall not bow down to any alien deity.
19:81:10:I am the Lord your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt; open wide your mouth, and I will fill it.
19:81:11:But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel was not willing to obey me.
19:81:12:So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, letting them follow their own devices.
19:81:13:If only my people would listen to me, if Israel would walk in my ways!
19:81:14:Then I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries.
19:81:15:Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, and their doom would last forever.
19:81:16:But I would feed you with the finest wheat; with honey from the rock, I would satisfy you.
19:82:1:In the divine assembly, God stands to judge among the gods.
19:82:2:He asks, "How long will you judge unjustly and favor the wicked? Selah."
19:82:3:"Defend the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and the destitute."
19:82:4:"Rescue the poor and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked."
19:82:5:The gods are ignorant and do not understand; they walk in darkness, causing the earth's foundations to shake.
19:82:6:I have said, "You are gods, all of you, sons of the Most High."
19:82:7:But you shall die like mortals, falling like any other ruler."
19:82:8:Arise, O God, and judge the earth, for You shall inherit all nations.
19:83:1:O God, don't remain silent; don't ignore us or stay quiet.
19:83:2:For look, your enemies are causing an uproar; those who hate you are raising their heads.
19:83:3:They conspire against your people and plot against those you cherish.
19:83:4:"Come," they say, "let's destroy them as a nation, so that Israel's name is remembered no more."
19:83:5:With one mind they come together, forming an alliance against you.
19:83:6:The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites join forces.
19:83:7:Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with Tyre's inhabitants.
19:83:8:Assyria has also joined them, lending support to the descendants of Lot. Selah.
19:83:9:Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
19:83:10:They were destroyed at Endor, becoming like dung on the ground.
19:83:11:Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna.
19:83:12:For they said, "Let's seize for ourselves the pastures of God."
19:83:13:My God, make them like tumbleweed, like chaff blown away by the wind.
19:83:14:As fire consumes a forest, as flames set mountains ablaze,
19:83:15:So pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.
19:83:16:Cover their faces with shame, so they will seek your name, O Lord.
19:83:17:May they be ashamed and dismayed forever; may they be humiliated and perish.
19:83:18:Let them know that you alone, whose name is the Lord, are the Most High over all the earth.
19:84:1:How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts!
19:84:2:My soul longs, indeed it faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God.
19:84:3:Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
19:84:4:Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they will always praise you. Selah.
19:84:5:Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
19:84:6:As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with blessings.
19:84:7:They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion.
19:84:8:O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah.
19:84:9:Behold our shield, O God, and look upon the face of your anointed.
19:84:10:For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
19:84:11:For the Lord God is a sun and shield; he bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
19:84:12:O Lord of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you.
19:85:1:Lord, you have shown favor to your land; you've restored the fortunes of Jacob.
19:85:2:You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins.
19:85:3:You withdrew all your wrath and turned from your burning anger.
19:85:4:Restore us once more, O God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.
19:85:5:Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
19:85:6:Won't you revive us again, so that your people may rejoice in you?
19:85:7:Show us your steadfast love, Lord, and grant us your salvation.
19:85:8:I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servants—but let them not turn back to folly.
19:85:9:Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
19:85:10:Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.
19:85:11:Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
19:85:12:The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.
19:85:13:Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.
19:86:1:Listen, O Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
19:86:2:Preserve my life, because I am devoted to You; save Your servant who trusts in You, my God.
19:86:3:Show me mercy, O Lord, for I call upon You all day long.
19:86:4:Bring joy to the soul of Your servant, for I lift up my soul to You, O Lord.
19:86:5:You are good and forgiving, O Lord, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon You.
19:86:6:Hear my prayer, O Lord; listen to my plea for mercy.
19:86:7:In my time of trouble, I call upon You, for You will answer me.
19:86:8:There is none like You among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like Yours.
19:86:9:All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and they shall glorify Your name.
19:86:10:For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God.
19:86:11:Teach me Your way, O Lord, that I may walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.
19:86:12:I will praise You with all my heart, O Lord my God, and I will glorify Your name forever.
19:86:13:For great is Your steadfast love toward me; You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
19:86:14:O God, arrogant people rise against me; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, and they do not set You before them.
19:86:15:But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and truth.
19:86:16:Turn to me and show me mercy; give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your maidservant.
19:86:17:Show me a sign of Your favor, that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame, because You, O Lord, have helped me and comforted me.
19:87:1:In the city that God founded, upon the holy mountains,
19:87:2:The Lord cherishes Zion more than all other dwelling places of Jacob.
19:87:3:Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
19:87:4:I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me; Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia too, they were born here.
19:87:5:Of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one were born in her," and the Most High himself will establish her.
19:87:6:The Lord will record in the register of peoples, "This person was born there." Selah.
19:87:7:Singers and dancers alike will say, "All my springs are in you."
19:88:1:O Lord, the God who saves me, day and night I cry out before you.
19:88:2:May my prayer reach your presence; listen closely to my cry for help.
19:88:3:For my soul is filled with troubles, and my life draws near to the grave.
19:88:4:I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I have become like one without strength.
19:88:5:Abandoned among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, you no longer remember them; they are cut off from your care.
19:88:6:You have placed me in the depths of the pit, in regions dark and deep.
19:88:7:Your wrath weighs heavily upon me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
19:88:8:You have taken away my companions and loved ones; darkness is now my closest friend.
19:88:9:I call to you, O Lord, every day; I spread out my hands to you.
19:88:10:Do you show wonders to the dead? Can the departed spirits rise and praise you?
19:88:11:Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in the place of destruction?
19:88:12:Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
19:88:13:But I cry out to you for help, O Lord; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
19:88:14:Why, O Lord, do you reject me and hide your face from me?
19:88:15:From my youth, I have been afflicted and close to death; I have suffered your terrors and am in despair.
19:88:16:Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.
19:88:17:All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.
19:88:18:You have taken from me friend and neighbor—darkness is my closest companion.
19:89:1:I will sing of the Lord's unfailing love forever; with my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
19:89:2:For I have said, "Love is built to last forever; you have established your faithfulness in the heavens."
19:89:3:"I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant:
19:89:4:'I will establish your descendants forever, and build your throne for all generations.'"
19:89:5:The heavens praise your wonders, O Lord, and your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones.
19:89:6:Who in the skies can compare to the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord?
19:89:7:God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, more awe-inspiring than all who surround him.
19:89:8:O Lord God of hosts, who is as mighty as you, O Lord? Your faithfulness surrounds you.
19:89:9:You rule over the surging sea; when its waves rise, you still them.
19:89:10:You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
19:89:11:The heavens are yours, and the earth as well; the world and everything in it, you have founded them.
19:89:12:You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.
19:89:13:Your arm is endowed with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.
19:89:14:Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.
19:89:15:Blessed are those who know the joyful sound! They walk, O Lord, in the light of your presence.
19:89:16:In your name they rejoice all day long, and by your righteousness, they are exalted.
19:89:17:For you are the glory of their strength, and by your favor, our horn is exalted.
19:89:18:Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19:89:19:Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: "I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have raised up a young man from among the people.
19:89:20:I have found David my servant; with my holy oil, I have anointed him.
19:89:21:My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.
19:89:22:The enemy will not get the better of him; the wicked will not oppress him.
19:89:23:I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
19:89:24:My faithfulness and love will be with him, and through my name, his horn will be exalted.
19:89:25:I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.
19:89:26:He will call out to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.'
19:89:27:And I will make him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
19:89:28:My love for him will endure forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.
19:89:29:I will establish his descendants forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
19:89:30:If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my judgments,
19:89:31:if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
19:89:32:then I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging.
19:89:33:But I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.
19:89:34:I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.
19:89:35:Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness—and I will not lie to David—
19:89:36:that his descendants shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.
19:89:37:It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky."
19:89:38:But now you have rejected and humbled us; you are no longer pleased with your anointed one.
19:89:39:You have renounced the covenant with your servant and defiled his crown in the dust.
19:89:40:You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.
19:89:41:All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
19:89:42:You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
19:89:43:Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.
19:89:44:You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.
19:89:45:You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame.
19:89:46:How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
19:89:47:Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility have you created all humanity?
19:89:48:Who can live and not see death, or save themselves from the power of the grave?
19:89:49:Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?
19:89:50:Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,
19:89:51:the taunts with which your enemies, Lord, have mocked, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.
19:89:52:Praise be to the Lord forever! Amen and Amen.
19:90:1:Our eternal refuge, Lord, you have been a home for all generations.
19:90:2:Before the mountains were born or the earth and world were formed, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
19:90:3:You turn people back to dust, saying, "Return to dust, O mortals."
19:90:4:A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.
19:90:5:You sweep them away like a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning.
19:90:6:In the morning it flourishes and is renewed; by evening it withers and dries up.
19:90:7:For we are consumed by your anger; we are troubled by your wrath.
19:90:8:You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
19:90:9:All our days pass away under your wrath; our years come to an end like a sigh.
19:90:10:The length of our days is seventy years, or eighty if we have the strength; yet their span is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
19:90:11:Who can comprehend the power of your anger? Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.
19:90:12:Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
19:90:13:Relent, O Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.
19:90:14:Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
19:90:15:Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.
19:90:16:May your deeds be shown to your servants, and your splendor to their children.
19:90:17:Let the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.
19:91:1:Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the Almighty's shadow.
19:91:2:I declare, "The Lord is my refuge and fortress; my God, in whom I trust."
19:91:3:He will save you from hidden traps and deadly diseases.
19:91:4:With his feathers, he'll cover you; under his wings, you'll find safety. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
19:91:5:You won't fear the terror of night nor the arrow that flies by day,
19:91:6:nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the plague that ravages at noon.
19:91:7:A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it won't come near you.
19:91:8:Only with your eyes will you witness the punishment of the wicked.
19:91:9:Because you've made the Lord your dwelling place—the Most High, who is my refuge—
19:91:10:no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your home.
19:91:11:For he will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.
19:91:12:They will lift you up in their hands, so you won't strike your foot against a stone.
19:91:13:You'll tread upon the lion and cobra; you'll trample the young lion and serpent underfoot.
19:91:14:"Because they love me," says the Lord, "I'll rescue them; I'll protect those who acknowledge my name.
19:91:15:When they call on me, I'll answer; I'll be with them in trouble, and deliver them, and honor them.
19:91:16:With long life, I'll satisfy them and show them my salvation."
19:92:1:It's delightful to give thanks to the Lord and sing praises to Your name, O Most High.
19:92:2:In the morning, we proclaim Your steadfast love; at night, we express gratitude for Your faithfulness.
19:92:3:Accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument, a harp, and the melody of a lyre.
19:92:4:For You, O Lord, have made me glad with Your work; I will rejoice in the accomplishments of Your hands.
19:92:5:How magnificent are Your deeds, O Lord! Your thoughts are unfathomably profound.
19:92:6:A senseless person cannot comprehend them, nor can a fool grasp their meaning.
19:92:7:Though the wicked sprout like grass and evildoers flourish, they are destined for destruction.
19:92:8:But You, O Lord, remain exalted forever.
19:92:9:For behold, Your enemies, O Lord, will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
19:92:10:You have anointed me with fresh oil, lifting my horn high like that of a wild ox.
19:92:11:I have seen the downfall of my adversaries and heard the cries of the wicked.
19:92:12:The righteous flourish like palm trees and grow tall like cedars in Lebanon.
19:92:13:Planted in the house of the Lord, they thrive in the courts of our God.
19:92:14:In old age, they continue to bear fruit, remaining vibrant and full of life.
19:92:15:This shows that the Lord is upright, a faithful Rock who is without injustice.
19:93:1:The Lord reigns! He is clothed in majesty; indeed, the world stands firm and cannot be shaken. Your throne has been established from ancient times; You are eternal.
19:93:2:Your mighty oceans roar, O Lord; they testify to your immense power.
19:93:3:The waves rise up, they lift their voices high; the sea's fury is a force to be reckoned with.
19:93:4:But mightier still is the Lord on high; His sovereignty surpasses even the strongest storm.
19:93:5:Your statutes stand true and unchanging, O Lord; holiness adorns your house forever.
19:94:1:O Lord, the God who avenges, show yourself.
19:94:2:Rise up, Judge of the earth; repay the arrogant what they deserve.
19:94:3:How long will the wicked, O Lord, how long will the wicked triumph?
19:94:4:They pour out their arrogant words; all evildoers boast.
19:94:5:Lord, they crush your people and oppress your heritage.
19:94:6:They slay the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.
19:94:7:Yet they say, "The Lord doesn't see; the God of Jacob doesn't pay attention."
19:94:8:Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?
19:94:9:He who implanted the ear, can he not hear? He who formed the eye, can he not see?
19:94:10:He who disciplines nations, will he not punish? The One who teaches mankind, does he lack knowledge?
19:94:11:The Lord knows human thoughts; he knows they are but a breath.
19:94:12:Blessed is the one you discipline, O Lord, the one you teach from your law,
19:94:13:To grant them relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19:94:14:For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will never abandon his inheritance.
19:94:15:Righteousness will be restored with justice, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19:94:16:Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand with me against evildoers?
19:94:17:If the Lord had not come to my help, my soul would have almost dwelt in silence.
19:94:18:When I said, "My foot is slipping," your unfailing love, O Lord, supported me.
19:94:19:When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.
19:94:20:Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?
19:94:21:They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
19:94:22:But the Lord has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.
19:94:23:He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the Lord our God will destroy them.
19:95:1:Come, let's sing joyfully to the Lord; let's shout out loud to our Rock of salvation!
19:95:2:With gratitude, approach Him; sing praises accompanied by music and celebrate His presence.
19:95:3:For the Lord is a great God, and a mighty King above all other gods.
19:95:4:In His hands lie the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.
19:95:5:The sea is His, for He created it; and His hands formed the dry land.
19:95:6:So let's bow down in worship; kneel before the Lord, our Maker.
19:95:7:For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice,
19:95:8:Don't harden your hearts as at Meribah, as on that day at Massah in the wilderness,
19:95:9:When your ancestors tested Me, and put Me to the test, even though they had seen My works.
19:95:10:For forty years I was grieved with that generation, and said, "They are a people with wandering hearts, and they don't understand My ways."
19:95:11:So in My anger, I swore, "They shall never enter My rest."
19:96:1:Sing a new song to the Lord, everyone on earth! Praise His name and tell of His salvation every day.
19:96:2:Each day, share the good news of His glory among the nations, and His wonderful deeds among all people.
19:96:3:For the Lord is great, deserving of immense praise; He is more awesome than any other god.
19:96:4:All the gods of other nations are merely idols, but the Lord created the heavens.
19:96:5:Majesty and splendor surround Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.
19:96:6:Give to the Lord, you families of nations, give to the Lord glory and honor.
19:96:7:Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.
19:96:8:Worship the Lord in holy attire; tremble before Him, all the earth!
19:96:9:Declare among the nations, "The Lord reigns!" The world is firmly established, it cannot be shaken; He governs the peoples justly.
19:96:10:Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea and everything in it resound with praise.
19:96:11:Let the fields and their crops burst forth with joy, and all the trees of the forest sing for joy.
19:96:12:They will sing before the Lord, for He comes to judge the earth; He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with His truth.
19:97:1:The LORD reigns! Let the earth rejoice, and the many islands celebrate.
19:97:2:Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice form the foundation of His throne.
19:97:3:Fire goes before Him, consuming His enemies on every side.
19:97:4:His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles.
19:97:5:Mountains melt like wax in the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
19:97:6:The heavens proclaim His righteousness, and all peoples witness His glory.
19:97:7:Those who worship idols are put to shame, for they boast in their worthless gods. All gods bow down before Him.
19:97:8:Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah celebrate because of Your judgments, O LORD.
19:97:9:For You, LORD, are the Most High over all the earth, exalted far above all gods.
19:97:10:You who love the LORD, hate evil! He protects the lives of His faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
19:97:11:Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
19:97:12:Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and give thanks to His holy name.
19:98:1:Sing a new song to the Lord, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have brought him victory.
19:98:2:The Lord has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
19:98:3:He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19:98:4:Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.
19:98:5:Play music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of a melody.
19:98:6:With trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn, shout triumphantly before the King, the Lord!
19:98:7:Let the sea and everything in it roar, the world and those who live in it.
19:98:8:Let the rivers clap their hands, and let the mountains sing together for joy,
19:98:9:For the Lord is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with fairness.
19:99:1:The Lord reigns supreme; let the nations tremble! He sits enthroned between the cherubim; let the earth shake!
19:99:2:Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted above all the peoples.
19:99:3:Let them praise your great and awesome name—he is holy.
19:99:4:The might of the King loves justice. You have established fairness; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19:99:5:Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool—he is holy.
19:99:6:Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who called on his name; they cried to the Lord, and he answered them.
19:99:7:He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.
19:99:8:O Lord our God, you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
19:99:9:Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
19:100:1:Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth!
19:100:2:Serve the Lord with gladness; come before Him with joyful songs.
19:100:3:Acknowledge that the Lord is God; He made us, and we belong to Him. We are His people, the sheep of His pasture.
19:100:4:Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name.
19:100:5:For the Lord is good; His steadfast love endures forever, and His faithfulness extends to all generations.
19:101:1:I will sing of your love and justice, O Lord; to you I will sing praises.
19:101:2:In my life, I'll strive to live with integrity; when will you come to me? I will walk in my house with a pure heart.
19:101:3:I won't set my eyes on anything wicked; I detest the actions of those who stray. They shall not cling to me.
19:101:4:A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have no part in evil.
19:101:5:Whoever secretly slanders their neighbor, I will silence them; those with haughty eyes and arrogant hearts, I won't tolerate.
19:101:6:I'll look favorably upon the faithful in the land, so they may dwell with me; those who walk in integrity will serve me.
19:101:7:No one who practices deceit will reside in my house; no one who speaks lies will stand in my presence.
19:101:8:Each morning, I will destroy all the wicked in the land, purging the city of the Lord of evildoers.
19:102:1:Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry for help reach you.
19:102:2:Don't hide your face from me in my time of distress; pay attention to me and answer quickly when I call.
19:102:3:For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.
19:102:4:My heart is stricken and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my food.
19:102:5:Because of my constant groaning, my bones cling to my skin.
19:102:6:I'm like a desert owl, a lonely bird on the roof.
19:102:7:All day long, my enemies taunt me; they mock and curse me.
19:102:8:I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix tears with my drink,
19:102:9:because of your anger and wrath; you've lifted me up and thrown me down.
19:102:10:My days are like a fleeting shadow, and I wither away like grass.
19:102:11:But you, O Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.
19:102:12:You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it's time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.
19:102:13:Your servants hold her stones dear and cherish even her dust.
19:102:14:The nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
19:102:15:For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.
19:102:16:He will respond to the prayers of the destitute; he won't despise their plea.
19:102:17:Let this be written for future generations, so that a people not yet created may praise the Lord.
19:102:18:The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, gazing upon the earth from heaven,
19:102:19:to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.
19:102:20:So that they might proclaim the name of the Lord in Zion and sing his praises in Jerusalem,
19:102:21:when peoples and kingdoms gather together to worship the Lord.
19:102:22:He has weakened my strength in the way; he has shortened my days.
19:102:23:I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations."
19:102:24:In the beginning, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19:102:25:They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You'll change them like clothing, and they will be discarded.
19:102:26:But you are the same, and your years will never end.
19:102:27:The children of your servants will live securely; their descendants will be established before you.
19:103:1:Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all that is within me praise His holy name.
19:103:2:Praise the Lord, my soul, and do not forget all His benefits.
19:103:3:He forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,
19:103:4:He redeems your life from destruction and crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies.
19:103:5:He satisfies your desires with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
19:103:6:The Lord works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.
19:103:7:He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.
19:103:8:The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in love.
19:103:9:He will not always accuse, nor will He hold His anger forever.
19:103:10:He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
19:103:11:For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His love for those who fear Him.
19:103:12:As far as the east is from the west, He has removed our transgressions from us.
19:103:13:Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.
19:103:14:He knows how we are formed; He remembers that we are dust.
19:103:15:As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field.
19:103:16:When the wind passes over it, it is gone, and its place knows it no more.
19:103:17:But the love of the Lord is everlasting for those who fear Him, and His righteousness extends to their children's children,
19:103:18:To those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His commandments.
19:103:19:The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.
19:103:20:Praise the Lord, you His angels, who excel in strength and do His bidding, heeding the voice of His word.
19:103:21:Bless the Lord, all you His hosts, you ministers who do His will.
19:103:22:Praise the Lord, all His works, in all places of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
19:104:1:Praise the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you are so great, clothed in majesty and splendor.
19:104:2:You wrap yourself in light like a garment, stretching out the heavens like a curtain.
19:104:3:You build your palace on the waters above; you make the clouds your chariot and ride on the wings of the wind.
19:104:4:You appoint the winds as your messengers, and flames of fire as your servants.
19:104:5:You set the earth on its foundations, ensuring it will never be shaken.
19:104:6:You covered the planet with the deep ocean like a robe; the waters stood above the mountains.
19:104:7:At your rebuke, the waters fled; they rushed away at the sound of your thunder.
19:104:8:The mountains rose, and the valleys sank down to the place you established for them.
19:104:9:You set a boundary that the waters cannot cross, so they'll never cover the earth again.
19:104:10:You send springs into the valleys, flowing between the hills.
19:104:11:They provide water for every wild animal; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19:104:12:Beside them, the birds of the sky make their nests; they sing among the branches.
19:104:13:From your lofty home, you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of your work.
19:104:14:You cause grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:
19:104:15:wine to gladden human hearts, oil to make faces shine, and bread to sustain the human heart.
19:104:16:The trees of the Lord are well-watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
19:104:17:There, the birds build their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers.
19:104:18:The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags provide a refuge for the hyrax.
19:104:19:You created the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.
19:104:20:You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals prowl.
19:104:21:The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
19:104:22:When the sun rises, they retreat and lie down in their dens.
19:104:23:People go out to their work, laboring until evening.
19:104:24:O Lord, how manifold are your works! In wisdom, you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19:104:25:Here is the vast, wide sea, teeming with countless living things, both large and small.
19:104:26:There, ships travel about; Leviathan, which you formed, plays in it.
19:104:27:All creatures look to you to provide them with food at the proper time.
19:104:28:When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
19:104:29:When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to dust.
19:104:30:When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
19:104:31:May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works.
19:104:32:He looks at the earth, and it trembles; he touches the mountains, and they smoke.
19:104:33:I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will praise my God as long as I live.
19:104:34:May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord.
19:104:35:Let sinners vanish from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord, my soul! Hallelujah!
19:105:1:Give thanks to the Lord, call on His name; make known His deeds among the people.
19:105:2:Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wondrous works.
19:105:3:Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
19:105:4:Search for the Lord and His strength; always seek His presence.
19:105:5:Remember the marvelous works He has done, His miracles, and the judgments He has pronounced,
19:105:6:O descendants of Abraham, His servant, children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
19:105:7:He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
19:105:8:He remembers His covenant forever, the word that He commanded, for a thousand generations,
19:105:9:The covenant He made with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac,
19:105:10:Which He confirmed to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
19:105:11:Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your allotted inheritance."
19:105:12:When they were few in number, just a handful, and strangers in it,
19:105:13:They wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
19:105:14:He allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
19:105:15:"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
19:105:16:He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;
19:105:17:He sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19:105:18:They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,
19:105:19:Till what he foretold came to pass, and the word of the Lord proved him true.
19:105:20:The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.
19:105:21:He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,
19:105:22:To instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
19:105:23:Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
19:105:24:The Lord made His people very fruitful; He made them too numerous for their foes,
19:105:25:Whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.
19:105:26:He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
19:105:27:They performed His signs among them, His wonders in the land of Ham.
19:105:28:He sent darkness and made the land dark; they did not rebel against His words.
19:105:29:He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.
19:105:30:Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
19:105:31:He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19:105:32:He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;
19:105:33:He struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
19:105:34:He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;
19:105:35:They ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.
19:105:36:Then He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.
19:105:37:He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.
19:105:38:Egypt was glad when they left because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
19:105:39:He spread out a cloud as a covering and a fire to give light at night.
19:105:40:They asked, and He brought them quail; He fed them well with the bread of heaven.
19:105:41:He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.
19:105:42:For He remembered His holy promise given to His servant Abraham.
19:105:43:He brought out His people with rejoicing, His chosen ones with shouts of joy;
19:105:44:He gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for,
19:105:45:That they might keep His precepts and observe His laws. Praise the Lord!
19:106:1:Praise the Lord! Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever.
19:106:2:Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare His praise?
19:106:3:Blessed are those who act justly and always do what is right.
19:106:4:Remember me, O Lord, when You show favor to Your people; come to my aid with Your salvation.
19:106:5:Let me experience the prosperity of Your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of Your nation, and join Your inheritance in giving praise.
19:106:6:We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
19:106:7:In Egypt, our fathers didn't understand Your wonders; they failed to remember Your abundant kindness and rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
19:106:8:Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make known His mighty power.
19:106:9:He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.
19:106:10:He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the grasp of the enemy, He redeemed them.
19:106:11:The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
19:106:12:Then they believed His words and sang His praise.
19:106:13:But they soon forgot His deeds and did not wait for His counsel.
19:106:14:In the desert, they yielded to craving; in the wilderness, they put God to the test.
19:106:15:He granted their request but sent a wasting disease upon them.
19:106:16:In the camp, they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, the Lord's holy one.
19:106:17:The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
19:106:18:A fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.
19:106:19:At Horeb, they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
19:106:20:They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull that eats grass.
19:106:21:They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
19:106:22:miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
19:106:23:So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses, His chosen one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from destroying them.
19:106:24:Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.
19:106:25:They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord.
19:106:26:So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,
19:106:27:to disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them throughout the lands.
19:106:28:They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
19:106:29:they provoked the Lord to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
19:106:30:But Phinehas intervened and the plague was stopped.
19:106:31:This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
19:106:32:By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord, and trouble came to Moses because of them;
19:106:33:for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips.
19:106:34:They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them,
19:106:35:but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
19:106:36:They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
19:106:37:They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
19:106:38:They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.
19:106:39:They were defiled by their actions and unfaithful in their deeds.
19:106:40:So the Lord's anger burned against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.
19:106:41:He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
19:106:42:Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
19:106:43:Many times He delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and wasted away in their sin.
19:106:44:Yet He took note of their distress when He heard their cry;
19:106:45:for their sake, He remembered His covenant and out of His great love, He relented.
19:106:46:He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.
19:106:47:Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in Your praise.
19:106:48:Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the Lord!
19:107:1:Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19:107:2:Let the redeemed of the Lord say this—those he saved from the hand of the enemy,
19:107:3:He gathered them from different lands, from east and west, north and south.
19:107:4:Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.
19:107:5:Hungry and thirsty, their spirits grew weak.
19:107:6:Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19:107:7:He led them along a straight path to find a city where they could live.
19:107:8:Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for humanity.
19:107:9:For he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
19:107:10:Others sat in darkness and deepest gloom, imprisoned in misery and chains,
19:107:11:Because they rebelled against God's commands and despised the plans of the Most High.
19:107:12:So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
19:107:13:In their despair, they cried to the Lord, and he saved them from their troubles.
19:107:14:He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, breaking their chains asunder.
19:107:15:Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love and his wondrous works for all people.
19:107:16:For he shatters the gates of bronze and breaks the iron bars apart.
19:107:17:Fools suffered affliction because of their rebellious ways and their sins.
19:107:18:They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death.
19:107:19:In their distress, they cried out to the Lord, who rescued them from their misery.
19:107:20:He sent forth his word and healed them, delivering them from destruction.
19:107:21:Let them praise the Lord for his loving devotion and his marvelous deeds for humanity.
19:107:22:Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and tell of his works with songs of joy.
19:107:23:Some went down to the sea in ships, conducting business on the great waters.
19:107:24:They saw the Lord's works and his wonders in the deep.
19:107:25:He spoke, and a stormy wind arose, lifting the waves of the sea.
19:107:26:They rose up to the heavens and plunged to the depths; their courage melted away in their peril.
19:107:27:They reeled and staggered like drunken men, at their wits' end.
19:107:28:Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.
19:107:29:He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
19:107:30:They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.
19:107:31:Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for humanity.
19:107:32:Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.
19:107:33:He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
19:107:34:Fertile land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
19:107:35:He transforms a desert into pools of water, parched land into flowing springs,
19:107:36:And there he makes the hungry live, so they can establish a city to settle in.
19:107:37:They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.
19:107:38:He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; he does not let their livestock decrease.
19:107:39:When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
19:107:40:He pours contempt on nobles and makes them wander in trackless wastes.
19:107:41:But he lifts the needy out of affliction and increases their families like flocks.
19:107:42:The upright see it and rejoice, but all the wicked are silenced.
19:107:43:Let the wise pay attention to these things and consider the loving deeds of the Lord.
19:108:1:My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my soul.
19:108:2:Awaken, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn with my song.
19:108:3:I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
19:108:4:For your lovingkindness is great above the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
19:108:5:Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let your glory be over all the earth.
19:108:6:Save us with your right hand and answer us, so that those you love may be delivered.
19:108:7:God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph, I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
19:108:8:Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.
19:108:9:Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19:108:10:Who will lead me to the fortified city? Who will guide me to Edom?
19:108:11:Have you not rejected us, O God? You no longer go out with our armies.
19:108:12:Give us help against the enemy, for human help is worthless.
19:108:13:With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
19:109:1:God, don't stand silent; hear my cries for help.
19:109:2:Wicked and deceitful people have opened their mouths against me, speaking lies.
19:109:3:They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.
19:109:4:In return for my love, they accuse me, but I continue to pray.
19:109:5:They repay my good with evil, and my love with hatred.
19:109:6:Set a wicked person over him, and let an accuser stand at his right hand.
19:109:7:When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers be counted as sin.
19:109:8:Let his days be few, and let someone else take his position.
19:109:9:May his children become orphans, and his wife a widow.
19:109:10:Let his children wander as beggars, searching for food far from their ruined homes.
19:109:11:May creditors seize all he has, and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
19:109:12:Let no one extend kindness to him, nor show mercy to his fatherless children.
19:109:13:May his descendants be cut off, and their names wiped out in the next generation.
19:109:14:Remember the sins of his ancestors, and let his mother's sins never be forgotten.
19:109:15:Let them always remain before the Lord, so that he may remove their memory from the earth.
19:109:16:For he never thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor, needy, and brokenhearted to their deaths.
19:109:17:He loved cursing—let it come back on him. He didn't delight in blessing—let it be far from him.
19:109:18:He wore cursing like a garment—let it soak into his body like water and seep into his bones like oil.
19:109:19:Let it be like the clothes he wears, a belt that always wraps around him.
19:109:20:May this be the Lord's punishment for my accusers, those who speak evil against me.
19:109:21:But you, O Sovereign Lord, help me for your name's sake; because of your unfailing love, deliver me.
19:109:22:I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
19:109:23:I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.
19:109:24:My knees are weak from fasting, and my body is thin and gaunt.
19:109:25:I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.
19:109:26:Help me, O Lord my God! Save me according to your steadfast love.
19:109:27:Let them know that this is your hand, that you, O Lord, have done it.
19:109:28:Let them curse, but you bless. When they attack, let them be put to shame, but let your servant rejoice.
19:109:29:May my accusers be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.
19:109:30:With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
19:109:31:For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who condemn his soul.
19:110:1:The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."
19:110:2:The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; rule over your enemies!
19:110:3:Your people will volunteer on the day of your power, arrayed in holy splendor; from the womb of the dawn, you have the dew of your youth.
19:110:4:The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
19:110:5:The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
19:110:6:He will judge the nations, piling up the dead and crushing the rulers of the earth.
19:110:7:He will drink from the brook by the wayside; therefore, he will lift up his head in triumph.
19:111:1:Praise the Lord! With all my heart, I will give thanks to the Lord among the righteous and in the assembly.
19:111:2:The works of the Lord are great, studied by all who delight in them.
19:111:3:His deeds are glorious and majestic; His righteousness endures forever.
19:111:4:He has made His wonders memorable; the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
19:111:5:He provides food for those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant always.
19:111:6:He has shown His people the power of His works, giving them the inheritance of the nations.
19:111:7:The works of His hands are faithful and just; all His precepts are trustworthy.
19:111:8:They are established forever and ever, enacted in truth and uprightness.
19:111:9:He sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever: holy and awesome is His name.
19:111:10:The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His precepts have good understanding. To Him belongs eternal praise.
19:112:1:Praise the Lord! Blessed is the one who fears the Lord and finds joy in following His commands.
19:112:2:Their descendants will be mighty in the land; a generation of the upright will be blessed.
19:112:3:Wealth and riches will fill their house, and their righteousness endures forever.
19:112:4:Even in darkness, light dawns for the upright; they are gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
19:112:5:Good comes to those who are generous and lend freely, conducting their affairs with justice.
19:112:6:Surely they will never be shaken; the righteous will be remembered forever.
19:112:7:They won't fear bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
19:112:8:Their hearts are secure, unafraid; in the end, they'll triumph over their foes.
19:112:9:Freely they give to the poor; their righteousness stands firm forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.
19:112:10:The wicked will see and be vexed, gnashing their teeth and wasting away; the desires of the wicked will come to nothing.
19:113:1:Praise the Lord! You who serve Him, praise His name.
19:113:2:Blessed be the name of the Lord now and forever.
19:113:3:From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the Lord's name be praised.
19:113:4:The Lord is exalted above all nations, His glory above the heavens.
19:113:5:Who can compare to the Lord our God, seated high on His throne?
19:113:6:He stoops down to look upon the heavens and the earth.
19:113:7:He lifts the poor from the dust and raises the needy from the ashes.
19:113:8:He seats them with princes, the leaders of His people.
19:113:9:He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord!
19:114:1:When the people of Israel left Egypt, and the family of Jacob departed from a foreign land,
19:114:2:Judah became God's sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.
19:114:3:The sea saw this and fled; the Jordan River turned back.
19:114:4:The mountains leaped like rams, and the hills like young sheep.
19:114:5:What made you flee, O sea? And you, Jordan, why did you turn back?
19:114:6:You mountains, what made you leap like rams? And you hills, like young sheep?
19:114:7:Tremble, Earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
19:114:8:Who turned the rock into a pool of water, and the flint into a flowing spring.
19:115:1:Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your steadfast love and faithfulness.
19:115:2:Why should the nations ask, "Where is their God now?"
19:115:3:Our God is in heaven; He does whatever pleases Him.
19:115:4:Their idols are silver and gold, crafted by human hands.
19:115:5:They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes but cannot see.
19:115:6:They possess ears but cannot hear, noses but cannot smell.
19:115:7:With hands but unable to feel, and feet but unable to walk; they can't even make a sound with their throats.
19:115:8:Those who make them will become like them, as will all who trust in them.
19:115:9:O Israel, put your trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield.
19:115:10:O house of Aaron, rely on the Lord! He is their help and protection.
19:115:11:You who fear the Lord, trust in Him! He is their help and defense.
19:115:12:The Lord remembers us and will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel and the house of Aaron.
19:115:13:He will bless those who fear the Lord, both small and great.
19:115:14:May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children.
19:115:15:You are blessed by the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
19:115:16:The highest heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth He has given to humanity.
19:115:17:It is not the dead who praise the Lord, nor any who descend into silence.
19:115:18:But we will bless the Lord, now and forevermore. Praise the Lord!
19:116:1:I love the Lord because He hears my voice and my pleas for mercy.
19:116:2:Since He inclines His ear to me, I will call upon Him as long as I live.
19:116:3:The snares of death surrounded me; I experienced distress and sorrow.
19:116:4:Then I called on the Lord's name, saying, "O Lord, please save me!"
19:116:5:Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; our God is compassionate.
19:116:6:The Lord protects the simple-hearted; when I was brought low, He saved me.
19:116:7:Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.
19:116:8:You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
19:116:9:I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
19:116:10:I believed, even when I said, "I am greatly afflicted."
19:116:11:I said in my haste, "All people are liars."
19:116:12:What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits toward me?
19:116:13:I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the Lord's name.
19:116:14:I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people.
19:116:15:Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His faithful ones.
19:116:16:O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the child of Your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.
19:116:17:I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the Lord's name.
19:116:18:I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people,
19:116:19:in the courts of the Lord's house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
19:117:1:Praise the Lord, all you nations; extol Him, all you peoples.
19:117:2:For His steadfast love toward us is great, and the truth of the Lord endures forever.
19:118:1:Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His steadfast love endures forever.
19:118:2:Let Israel declare that His loving-kindness lasts forever.
19:118:3:Let the house of Aaron say, "His mercy is everlasting."
19:118:4:Let those who fear the Lord proclaim, "His steadfast love goes on forever."
19:118:5:In my distress, I called upon the Lord; He answered me and set me free.
19:118:6:The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid. What can people do to me?
19:118:7:The Lord is my helper; I will look in triumph over my enemies.
19:118:8:It is better to trust in the Lord than to rely on humans.
19:118:9:It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in nobles.
19:118:10:All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord, I cut them off.
19:118:11:They encircled me on every side, yet by the Lord's power, I defeated them.
19:118:12:Like swarming bees, they attacked me, but I destroyed them in the name of the Lord.
19:118:13:Though I was pushed hard and about to fall, the Lord came to my aid.
19:118:14:The Lord is my strength and song; He has become my salvation.
19:118:15:Joyful shouts of victory resound in the tents of the righteous: "The Lord's right hand has done mighty things!"
19:118:16:The Lord's right hand is lifted high; the Lord's right hand performs valiantly.
19:118:17:I will not die but live and declare the works of the Lord.
19:118:18:The Lord has disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death.
19:118:19:Open the gates of righteousness for me; I will enter and give thanks to the Lord.
19:118:20:This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it.
19:118:21:I praise You, for You have answered me and become my salvation.
19:118:22:The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
19:118:23:This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
19:118:24:This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
19:118:25:Please, Lord, save us now; we pray for prosperity, O Lord.
19:118:26:Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord; we bless you from the house of the Lord.
19:118:27:God is the Lord, and He has made His light shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.
19:118:28:You are my God, and I will give You thanks; You are my God, and I will exalt You.
19:118:29:Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His steadfast love endures forever.
19:119:1:How blessed are those who walk the straight path, following the law of the Lord!
19:119:2:Joyful are those who observe His testimonies and seek Him wholeheartedly.
19:119:3:They do no wrong but walk in His ways.
19:119:4:You have commanded us to diligently keep Your precepts.
19:119:5:If only my actions were steadfast in obeying Your statutes!
19:119:6:Then I would not be ashamed when I consider all Your commandments.
19:119:7:I will praise You with an upright heart when I learn Your righteous judgments.
19:119:8:I will keep Your statutes; please don't forsake me.
19:119:9:How can a young person keep their way pure? By guarding it according to Your word.
19:119:10:With all my heart, I seek You; let me not stray from Your commandments.
19:119:11:In my heart, I treasure Your words so that I may not sin against You.
19:119:12:Blessed are You, O Lord; teach me Your statutes.
19:119:13:With my lips, I declare all the judgments of Your mouth.
19:119:14:I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches.
19:119:15:I will meditate on Your precepts and consider Your ways.
19:119:16:I will delight in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.
19:119:17:Be generous to Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word.
19:119:18:Open my eyes, so I may behold wondrous things from Your law.
19:119:19:I am a stranger on earth; do not hide Your commandments from me.
19:119:20:My soul is consumed with longing for Your judgments at all times.
19:119:21:You rebuke the arrogant, those who stray from Your commandments; may they be cursed.
19:119:22:Remove from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept Your testimonies.
19:119:23:Though rulers sit and slander me, Your servant meditates on Your statutes.
19:119:24:Your testimonies are my delight; they are my counselors.
19:119:25:My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to Your word.
19:119:26:I told You about my ways, and You answered me; teach me Your statutes.
19:119:27:Help me understand the way of Your precepts, that I may meditate on Your wondrous works.
19:119:28:My soul melts away in sorrow; strengthen me according to Your word.
19:119:29:Keep me from the deceitful way, and graciously grant me Your law.
19:119:30:I have chosen the way of truth; I set Your judgments before me.
19:119:31:I cling to Your testimonies, O Lord; let me not be put to shame!
19:119:32:I will run in the path of Your commandments, for You will enlarge my heart.
19:119:33:Teach me, O Lord, the way of Your statutes, and I will keep it to the end.
19:119:34:Give me understanding, so I can keep Your law and obey it with all my heart.
19:119:35:Lead me in the path of Your commandments, for I find joy in them.
19:119:36:Incline my heart toward Your testimonies, not toward selfish gain.
19:119:37:Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; give me life in Your ways.
19:119:38:Fulfill Your promise to Your servant, so that You may be feared.
19:119:39:Take away the disgrace I dread, for Your judgments are good.
19:119:40:Behold, I long for Your precepts; in Your righteousness give me life.
19:119:41:Let Your steadfast love come to me, O Lord, Your salvation according to Your promise;
19:119:42:Then I can answer those who taunt me, for I trust in Your word.
19:119:43:Do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for my hope is in Your judgments.
19:119:44:I will keep Your law continually, forever and ever,
19:119:45:And I shall walk in freedom, for I have sought Your precepts.
19:119:46:I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings and not be ashamed.
19:119:47:I find delight in Your commandments, which I love.
19:119:48:I will lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love, and meditate on Your statutes.
19:119:49:Remember Your word to Your servant, in which You have given me hope.
19:119:50:This is my comfort in my affliction, that Your promise gives me life.
19:119:51:The arrogant utterly deride me, but I do not turn away from Your law.
19:119:52:When I think of Your judgments from of old, O Lord, I take comfort.
19:119:53:Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked who forsake Your law.
19:119:54:Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning.
19:119:55:I remember Your name in the night, O Lord, and keep Your law.
19:119:56:This blessing has come to me, for I have kept Your precepts.
19:119:57:The Lord is my portion; I promise to keep Your words.
19:119:58:I entreat Your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your promise.
19:119:59:When I think on my ways, I turn my feet to Your testimonies.
19:119:60:I hasten and do not delay to keep Your commandments.
19:119:61:Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me, I do not forget Your law.
19:119:62:At midnight, I rise to praise You, because of Your righteous rules.
19:119:63:I am a companion of all who fear You, of those who keep Your precepts.
19:119:64:The earth, O Lord, is full of Your steadfast love; teach me Your statutes!
19:119:65:You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word.
19:119:66:Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in Your commandments.
19:119:67:Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I obey Your word.
19:119:68:You are good and do good; teach me Your statutes.
19:119:69:The arrogant smear me with lies, but with my whole heart, I keep Your precepts.
19:119:70:Their hearts are callous and unfeeling, but I delight in Your law.
19:119:71:It is good for me that I was afflicted, so I could learn Your statutes.
19:119:72:The law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
19:119:73:Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding to learn Your commandments.
19:119:74:Those who fear You shall see me and rejoice because I have hoped in Your word.
19:119:75:I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right, and in faithfulness, You have afflicted me.
19:119:76:Let Your steadfast love comfort me according to Your promise to Your servant.
19:119:77:Let Your mercy come to me, that I may live; for Your law is my delight.
19:119:78:Let the arrogant be put to shame because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on Your precepts.
19:119:79:Let those who fear You turn to me, that they may know Your testimonies.
19:119:80:May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, so I won't be ashamed.
19:119:81:My soul longs for Your salvation; I hope in Your word.
19:119:82:My eyes long for Your promise; I ask, "When will You comfort me?"
19:119:83:Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget Your statutes.
19:119:84:How long must Your servant endure? When will You judge those who persecute me?
19:119:85:The arrogant have dug pitfalls for me; they do not live according to Your law.
19:119:86:All Your commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me!
19:119:87:They almost made an end of me on earth, but I did not forsake Your precepts.
19:119:88:In Your steadfast love, give me life, that I may keep the testimonies of Your mouth.
19:119:89:Forever, O Lord, Your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.
19:119:90:Your faithfulness endures to all generations; You established the earth, and it stands fast.
19:119:91:By Your appointment, they stand this day, for all things are Your servants.
19:119:92:If Your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
19:119:93:I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have given me life.
19:119:94:I am Yours; save me, for I have sought Your precepts.
19:119:95:The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider Your testimonies.
19:119:96:I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is boundless.
19:119:97:Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all day long.
19:119:98:Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.
19:119:99:I have more understanding than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation.
19:119:100:I understand more than the aged, for I keep Your precepts.
19:119:101:I hold back my feet from every evil way, in order to keep Your word.
19:119:102:I do not turn aside from Your rules, for You have taught me.
19:119:103:How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
19:119:104:Through Your precepts, I get understanding; therefore, I hate every false way.
19:119:105:Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
19:119:106:I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, to keep Your righteous rules.
19:119:107:I am severely afflicted; give me life, O Lord, according to Your word!
19:119:108:Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O Lord, and teach me Your rules.
19:119:109:I hold my life in my hand continually, but I do not forget Your law.
19:119:110:The wicked have laid a snare for me, but I do not stray from Your precepts.
19:119:111:Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.
19:119:112:I incline my heart to perform Your statutes forever, to the end.
19:119:113:I hate the double-minded, but I love Your law.
19:119:114:You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in Your word.
19:119:115:Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God.
19:119:116:Uphold me according to Your promise, that I may live, and let me not be put to shame in my hope!
19:119:117:Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for Your statutes continually!
19:119:118:You spurn all who go astray from Your statutes, for their cunning is in vain.
19:119:119:All the wicked of the earth You discard like dross, therefore I love Your testimonies.
19:119:120:My flesh trembles for fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments.
19:119:121:I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.
19:119:122:Give Your servant a pledge of good; let not the insolent oppress me.
19:119:123:My eyes long for Your salvation and for the fulfillment of Your righteous promise.
19:119:124:Deal with Your servant according to Your steadfast love, and teach me Your statutes.
19:119:125:I am Your servant; give me understanding, that I may know Your testimonies!
19:119:126:It is time for the Lord to act, for Your law has been broken.
19:119:127:Truly I love Your commandments above gold, above fine gold.
19:119:128:Therefore, I consider all Your precepts to be right; I hate every false way.
19:119:129:Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore, my soul keeps them.
19:119:130:The unfolding of Your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.
19:119:131:I open my mouth and pant because I long for Your commandments.
19:119:132:Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is Your way with those who love Your name.
19:119:133:Keep steady my steps according to Your promise, and let no iniquity get dominion over me.
19:119:134:Redeem me from man's oppression, that I may keep Your precepts.
19:119:135:Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes.
19:119:136:My eyes shed streams of tears because people do not keep Your law.
19:119:137:Righteous are You, O Lord, and right are Your rules.
19:119:138:You have appointed Your testimonies in righteousness and in all faithfulness.
19:119:139:My zeal consumes me because my foes forget Your words.
19:119:140:Your promise is well tried, and Your servant loves it.
19:119:141:I am small and despised, yet I do not forget Your precepts.
19:119:142:Your righteousness is righteous forever, and Your law is true.
19:119:143:Trouble and anguish have found me out, but Your commandments are my delight.
19:119:144:Your testimonies are righteous forever; give me understanding that I may live.
19:119:145:With my whole heart, I cry; answer me, O Lord! I will keep Your statutes.
19:119:146:I call to You; save me, that I may observe Your testimonies.
19:119:147:I rise before dawn and cry for help; I hope in Your words.
19:119:148:My eyes are awake before the watches of the night, that I may meditate on Your promise.
19:119:149:Hear my voice according to Your steadfast love; O Lord, according to Your justice give me life.
19:119:150:They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose; they are far from Your law.
19:119:151:But You are near, O Lord, and all Your commandments are true.
19:119:152:Long have I known from Your testimonies that You have founded them forever.
19:119:153:Look on my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget Your law.
19:119:154:Plead my cause and redeem me; give me life according to Your promise!
19:119:155:Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek Your statutes.
19:119:156:Great is Your mercy, O Lord; give me life according to Your rules.
19:119:157:Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, but I do not swerve from Your testimonies.
19:119:158:I look at the faithless with disgust because they do not keep Your commands.
19:119:159:Consider how I love Your precepts! Give me life according to Your steadfast love.
19:119:160:The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous rules endures forever.
19:119:161:Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words.
19:119:162:I rejoice at Your word like one who finds great spoil.
19:119:163:I hate and abhor falsehood, but I love Your law.
19:119:164:Seven times a day I praise You for Your righteous rules.
19:119:165:Great peace have those who love Your law; nothing can make them stumble.
19:119:166:I hope for Your salvation, O Lord, and I do Your commandments.
19:119:167:My soul keeps Your testimonies; I love them exceedingly.
19:119:168:I keep Your precepts and testimonies, for all my ways are before You.
19:119:169:Let my cry come before You, O Lord; give me understanding according to Your word!
19:119:170:Let my plea come before You; deliver me according to Your word.
19:119:171:My lips will pour forth praise, for You teach me Your statutes.
19:119:172:My tongue will sing of Your word, for all Your commandments are right.
19:119:173:Let Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts.
19:119:174:I long for Your salvation, O Lord, and Your law is my delight.
19:119:175:Let my soul live and praise You, and let Your rules help me.
19:119:176:I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments.
19:120:1:In my distress, I cried out to the Lord, and He answered me.
19:120:2:Lord, save me from deceitful lips and lying tongues.
19:120:3:What will be given to you, and what more will be done to you, O deceitful tongue?
19:120:4:Sharp arrows from a warrior, along with burning coals of the broom tree, are your punishment.
19:120:5:Woe is me, for I dwell in Meshech, and reside among the tents of Kedar!
19:120:6:My soul has lived too long with those who hate peace.
19:120:7:I seek peace, but when I speak of it, they desire war.
19:121:1:I look up to the hills, where does my help come from?
19:121:2:My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
19:121:3:He won't let your foot slip; your protector never slumbers.
19:121:4:Indeed, the Guardian of Israel neither sleeps nor rests.
19:121:5:The Lord is your keeper; He stands by your side as a protective shade.
19:121:6:The sun won't harm you during the day, nor the moon at night.
19:121:7:The Lord will protect you from all evil; He'll safeguard your life.
19:121:8:The Lord will watch over your coming and going, now and forevermore.
19:122:1:I was overjoyed when they said to me, "Let's go to the house of the Lord."
19:122:2:Now our feet stand within your gates, Jerusalem.
19:122:3:Jerusalem is built as a city that is closely compact together.
19:122:4:This is where the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.
19:122:5:For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
19:122:6:Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may those who love you prosper.
19:122:7:May peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
19:122:8:For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, "Peace be within you."
19:122:9:For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your good.
19:123:1:To you, I lift my eyes, O One who dwells in the heavens.
19:123:2:As the eyes of servants look to their master's hand, and as the eyes of a maid to her mistress's hand, so our eyes are on the Lord our God, until He shows us mercy.
19:123:3:Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we have endured much contempt.
19:123:4:Our souls have been filled with the mockery of the arrogant and the disdain of the proud.
19:124:1:If it had not been for the LORD on our side, let Israel now declare,
19:124:2:Suppose the LORD hadn't stood up for us when people rose against us,
19:124:3:Then they would have swallowed us alive in their fierce anger,
19:124:4:The waters would have engulfed us; the torrent would have swept over us,
19:124:5:Yes, the raging waters would have overwhelmed us.
19:124:6:Blessed be the LORD, who did not give us as prey to their teeth!
19:124:7:We escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare; the trap was broken, and we were set free.
19:124:8:Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19:125:1:Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, unshakable and enduring forever.
19:125:2:As mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people both now and always.
19:125:3:The wicked won't rule over the righteous, ensuring they don't fall into evil ways.
19:125:4:Lord, show kindness to those who do good and have pure hearts.
19:125:5:But for those who turn to crooked paths, may the Lord lead them away with evildoers. May peace be upon Israel.
19:126:1:When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
19:126:2:Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with joyful songs. They said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."
19:126:3:Indeed, the Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.
19:126:4:Bring back our captives, O Lord, like streams in the desert.
19:126:5:Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
19:126:6:Though they go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, they will return with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them.
19:127:1:Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Without the Lord watching over the city, the watchman stays awake for nothing.
19:127:2:It's pointless to rise early and stay up late, working hard for food to eat, for God provides for His beloved even while they sleep.
19:127:3:Children are indeed a heritage from the Lord, a reward like arrows in the hands of a warrior.
19:127:4:Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; he won't be put to shame when arguing with his enemies at the city gates.
19:128:1:Happy are those who respect the Lord and follow his ways.
19:128:2:You will enjoy the fruits of your labor; you'll be prosperous and content.
19:128:3:Your spouse will be like a fruitful vine within your home, and your children will be like olive shoots around your table.
19:128:4:Indeed, this is how the Lord blesses those who fear him.
19:128:5:May the Lord bless you from Zion, and may you see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life.
19:128:6:May you live to see your grandchildren, and may peace be upon Israel.
19:129:1:Many times they've attacked me since my youth, let Israel now declare.
19:129:2:Repeatedly they have assaulted me from my youth, but they couldn't prevail against me.
19:129:3:On my back, the plowers plowed, making long furrows.
19:129:4:Yet the Lord is righteous; He has cut the cords of the wicked.
19:129:5:May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned back.
19:129:6:Let them become like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows up,
19:129:7:With no one able to harvest it or gather it into their hands.
19:129:8:And may passersby not say, "The blessing of the Lord be upon you. We bless you in the name of the Lord."
19:130:1:Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord.
19:130:2:Hear my voice; let your ears be attentive to my pleas for mercy.
19:130:3:If you kept a record of sins, who could stand, O Lord?
19:130:4:But with you there is forgiveness, so that we may revere you.
19:130:5:I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope.
19:130:6:My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning.
19:130:7:Israel, trust in the Lord, for with him there is steadfast love and plentiful redemption.
19:130:8:He will indeed redeem Israel from all their sins.
19:131:1:Quiet my heart is, O Lord, it's not proud; my eyes do not look down on others; I don't concern myself with grand matters that are beyond my understanding.
19:131:2:Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself, like a contented child resting on its mother's lap; my soul is like that of a weaned child.
19:131:3:So, Israel, place your hope in the Lord, now and always.
19:132:1:Remember, O Lord, how David devoted himself to you, and how he swore an oath to the Mighty One of Jacob.
19:132:2:"I will not enter my house or go to my bed,
19:132:3:I will not allow sleep for my eyes nor slumber for my eyelids,
19:132:4:until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."
19:132:5:Indeed, we heard about it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
19:132:6:Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool.
19:132:7:Arise, O Lord, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
19:132:8:May your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your faithful ones sing for joy.
19:132:9:For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one.
19:132:10:The Lord swore an oath to David, a promise he will not break: "I will place one of your descendants on your throne.
19:132:11:If your children keep my covenant and the testimony I teach them, their children will also sit on your throne forever."
19:132:12:For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it as his dwelling place:
19:132:13:"This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
19:132:14:I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
19:132:15:Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy.
19:132:16:There I will make a horn sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.
19:132:17:His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."
19:133:1:Look at how good and pleasant it is when people live together in harmony!
19:133:2:It's like precious oil poured on the head, running down onto the beard, even Aaron's beard, flowing down to the collar of his robes.
19:133:3:It's also like the dew of Mount Hermon, falling on the hills of Zion. For there, the Lord bestows his blessing, life forevermore.
19:134:1:Come, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand by night in the house of the Lord!
19:134:2:Lift up your hands to the holy place and praise the Lord.
19:134:3:The Lord, who made heaven and earth, bless you from Zion!
19:135:1:Praise the Lord! Praise his name, you servants of the Lord!
19:135:2:You who stand in the house of the Lord, within the courts of our God,
19:135:3:Celebrate the Lord, for he is good; sing praises to his name, for it is delightful.
19:135:4:For the Lord has chosen Jacob as his own, Israel as his treasured possession.
19:135:5:I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods.
19:135:6:Whatever the Lord desires, he does in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
19:135:7:He summons clouds from the ends of the earth, makes lightning for the rain, and brings wind out of his storehouses.
19:135:8:He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both people and animals.
19:135:9:He sent signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
19:135:10:He defeated many nations and slaughtered mighty kings,
19:135:11:Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
19:135:12:He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.
19:135:13:Your name, O Lord, endures forever, and your fame, O Lord, throughout all generations.
19:135:14:For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.
19:135:15:The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
19:135:16:They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes but cannot see.
19:135:17:They have ears but cannot hear, nor is there any breath in their mouths.
19:135:18:Those who make them become like them, and so do all who trust in them.
19:135:19:O house of Israel, bless the Lord! O house of Aaron, bless the Lord!
19:135:20:O house of Levi, bless the Lord! You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!
19:135:21:Blessed be the Lord from Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
19:136:1:Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever.
19:136:2:Express gratitude to the God of gods; His steadfast love never ends.
19:136:3:Praise the Lord of lords; His unending love persists.
19:136:4:He alone performs great wonders; His eternal love remains.
19:136:5:By His wisdom, He made the heavens; His enduring love continues.
19:136:6:He spread out the earth upon the waters; His everlasting love is constant.
19:136:7:He created the great lights in the sky; His faithful love is ceaseless.
19:136:8:The sun rules the day; His infinite love is unwavering.
19:136:9:The moon and stars govern the night; His boundless love is steadfast.
19:136:10:He struck down the firstborn of Egypt; His perpetual love endures.
19:136:11:He brought Israel out from among them; His undying love is unbroken.
19:136:12:With a strong hand and an outstretched arm; His relentless love sustains.
19:136:13:He divided the Red Sea in two; His tireless love is endless.
19:136:14:He led Israel through its midst; His unfailing love is eternal.
19:136:15:He overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea; His abiding love is unchanging.
19:136:16:He guided His people through the wilderness; His unceasing love is unwavering.
19:136:17:He struck down great kings; His lasting love remains.
19:136:18:He defeated powerful rulers; His enduring love is steadfast.
19:136:19:Sihon, king of the Amorites, was slain; His unending love continues.
19:136:20:Og, king of Bashan, also fell; His constant love is everlasting.
19:136:21:He gave their land as an inheritance; His ceaseless love is faithful.
19:136:22:A heritage for Israel, His servant; His unwavering love is infinite.
19:136:23:In our lowly state, He remembered us; His steadfast love is boundless.
19:136:24:He rescued us from our enemies; His enduring love is perpetual.
19:136:25:He provides food for every living creature; His unbroken love is undying.
19:136:26:Give thanks to the God of heaven; His eternal love endures forever.
19:137:1:By the rivers of Babylon, we sat down and cried as we remembered Zion.
19:137:2:On the willows there, we hung up our harps.
19:137:3:For our captors demanded songs from us; they wanted joyful tunes, but how could we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?
19:137:4:If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its skill.
19:137:5:Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you, if I don't consider Jerusalem my highest joy.
19:137:6:Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell: "Tear it down," they cried, "tear it down to its foundations!"
19:137:7:O Babylon, you destroyer, blessed is the one who repays you for what you've done to us.
19:137:8:Blessed is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
19:138:1:I give you thanks with all my heart, O Lord; before the gods, I sing your praise.
19:138:2:I bow down toward your holy temple and praise your name for your steadfast love and faithfulness; for you have exalted your name and your word above everything.
19:138:3:On the day I called, you answered me; you increased strength within my soul.
19:138:4:All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Lord, when they hear the words of your mouth.
19:138:5:They will sing about the ways of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord is great.
19:138:6:Though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar.
19:138:7:Even in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life; you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand delivers me.
19:138:8:The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your steadfast love, O Lord, endures forever. Do not abandon the work of your hands.
19:139:1:Lord, you have examined me and know everything about me.
19:139:2:You understand my thoughts from afar, even before I think them.
19:139:3:You observe my actions and my resting; you are familiar with all my ways.
19:139:4:Before a word is on my tongue, you already know it completely, O Lord.
19:139:5:You surround me—front and back—and place your hand upon me.
19:139:6:Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to grasp.
19:139:7:Where can I go to escape your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
19:139:8:If I ascend to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there as well.
19:139:9:Should I take the wings of the dawn or dwell in the remotest parts of the sea,
19:139:10:even there your hand will guide me, and your right hand will hold me fast.
19:139:11:If I say, "Surely darkness will hide me, and light become night around me,"
19:139:12:even darkness is not dark to you; the night shines like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
19:139:13:For you created my innermost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.
19:139:14:I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are marvelous, and I know that full well.
19:139:15:My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
19:139:16:Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in your book before one of them came to be.
19:139:17:How precious are your thoughts toward me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
19:139:18:If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; when I awake, I am still with you.
19:139:19:O that you would slay the wicked, O God; away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
19:139:20:For they speak against you with malicious intent; your enemies take your name in vain.
19:139:21:Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and detest those who rise against you?
19:139:22:I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them as my enemies.
19:139:23:Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.
19:139:24:See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way. 
19:140:1:O Lord, rescue me from evil people; protect me from those who are violent.
19:140:2:They devise wicked schemes in their hearts and constantly stir up trouble.
19:140:3:Their tongues are sharp like serpents, and their words contain the venom of vipers.
19:140:4:Guard me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; keep me safe from those who seek to harm me, for they have set traps for my feet.
19:140:5:The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out cords as a net, and placed traps along my path.
19:140:6:I say to the Lord, "You are my God; hear, O Lord, the sound of my pleas for mercy."
19:140:7:Lord Almighty, my strong defender, you shield my head in times of battle.
19:140:8:Do not grant the desires of the wicked, O Lord; do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud.
19:140:9:As for the heads of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
19:140:10:Let burning coals fall upon them; may they be thrown into fire, into deep pits, never to rise again.
19:140:11:Do not let slanderers prosper on earth; let evil hunt down the violent with speed and force.
19:140:12:I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and secure justice for the needy.
19:140:13:Indeed, the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence.
19:141:1:Lord, I call out to you; please come quickly to my aid! Listen closely as I lift my voice in prayer.
19:141:2:Let my prayer be like incense before you, and the lifting of my hands like the evening offering.
19:141:3:Guard my mouth, O Lord, and keep watch over the door of my lips.
19:141:4:Don't let my heart be drawn to evil or engage in wicked acts with evildoers. Let me not partake in their delicacies.
19:141:5:Let the righteous correct me; it is kindness. Let them rebuke me; it is oil on my head, which I will not refuse. But I will keep praying against their wicked deeds.
19:141:6:When their leaders are thrown down from the cliffs, they will realize that my words were true.
19:141:7:As when a farmer plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.
19:141:8:But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge—do not leave me defenseless.
19:141:9:Protect me from the traps set by evildoers, and keep me safe from the snares they have laid.
19:141:10:Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by unharmed.
19:142:1:With my voice, I cry out to the Lord; in my plea, I pour out my concerns before Him.
19:142:2:I reveal my troubles to Him, laying my needs before His presence.
19:142:3:When my spirit is overwhelmed within me, You know my path; in the way where I walk, they've hidden a trap for me.
19:142:4:Looking to my right, I see no one who recognizes me; there's no refuge for me, and nobody cares about my well-being.
19:142:5:I call out to You, O Lord, declaring, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
19:142:6:Listen to my cry, for I am brought very low; rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.
19:142:7:Set me free from this prison, so that I may praise Your name; then the righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness toward me.
19:143:1:Lord, hear my prayer; listen to my plea for mercy. In your faithfulness and righteousness, come to my aid.
19:143:2:Don't judge me, your servant, for no one alive is innocent before you.
19:143:3:The enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life into the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
19:143:4:My spirit grows weak within me; my heart is overwhelmed with dismay.
19:143:5:I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your deeds, reflecting on the work of your hands.
19:143:6:I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land.
19:143:7:Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Don't hide your face from me, or I'll be like those who descend into the pit.
19:143:8:Let me hear your lovingkindness in the morning, for I trust in you. Show me the path I should take, for I lift up my soul to you.
19:143:9:Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I seek refuge in you.
19:143:10:Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
19:143:11:For your name's sake, Lord, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.
19:143:12:In your steadfast love, cut off my enemies and destroy all who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.
19:144:1:Praise the Lord! My Rock, who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle.
19:144:2:He is my steadfast love and fortress, my stronghold and deliverer, my shield in whom I take refuge, who subdues nations under me.
19:144:3:Lord, what are humans that you care for them, or the children of man that you think of them?
19:144:4:They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.
19:144:5:Stretch out your heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, so they smoke.
19:144:6:Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and confound them.
19:144:7:Reach down from on high and rescue me; save me from the deep waters and the power of foreigners,
19:144:8:Whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand is a hand of deceit.
19:144:9:I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play praises to you,
19:144:10:You who give victory to kings, who rescues David your servant from the deadly sword.
19:144:11:Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand is a hand of deceit.
19:144:12:May our sons be like plants, growing strong from their youth; our daughters like corner pillars, carved to adorn a palace.
19:144:13:May our barns be filled with every kind of produce; may our sheep increase by thousands, and tens of thousands in our fields.
19:144:14:May our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no loss or failure; may there be no cry of distress in our streets.
19:144:15:Blessed are the people who have it so; blessed are the people whose God is the Lord.
19:145:1:I will praise you, my God and King; I will bless your name forever and ever.
19:145:2:Every day I will bless you; I will praise your name forever and ever.
19:145:3:Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised; his greatness is beyond understanding.
19:145:4:One generation will commend your works to another; they will tell of your mighty acts.
19:145:5:They'll speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty and meditate on your wondrous works.
19:145:6:People will talk about the power of your awesome deeds, and I will proclaim your greatness.

19:145:8:The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.
19:145:9:The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.
19:145:10:All your works will thank you, Lord, and your faithful followers will praise you.
19:145:11:They will speak of the glory of your kingdom and discuss your might,
19:145:12:To make known to people your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
19:145:13:Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does.
19:145:14:The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
19:145:15:The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time.
19:145:16:You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
19:145:17:The Lord is righteous in all his ways and loving toward all he has made.

19:145:19:He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.
19:145:20:The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
19:145:21:My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
19:146:1:Praise the Lord! Let my whole being celebrate the Lord.
19:146:2:I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.
19:146:3:Don't put your trust in powerful leaders or in human beings who cannot save.
19:146:4:When they die, they return to the ground; their plans perish with them.
19:146:5:Blessed are those who find help in the God of Jacob and put their hope in the Lord their God.
19:146:6:He is the one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever.
19:146:7:He provides justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free.
19:146:8:The Lord opens the eyes of the blind and lifts up those who are weighed down. The Lord loves the righteous.
19:146:9:The Lord protects foreigners and cares for orphans and widows. But he frustrates the plans of the wicked.
19:146:10:The Lord reigns forever; your God, O Zion, rules through all generations. Praise the Lord!
19:147:1:Praise the Lord! It's good to sing praises to our God; it's delightful and fitting to honor Him with songs.
19:147:2:The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem, gathering together Israel's exiled people.
19:147:3:He heals those with broken hearts and binds up their wounds.
19:147:4:He determines the number of stars and calls each one by name.
19:147:5:Great is our Lord, abundant in power; His understanding has no limit.
19:147:6:The Lord supports the humble but casts the wicked down to the ground.
19:147:7:Sing to the Lord a song of thanksgiving; make music to our God with the harp.
19:147:8:He covers the sky with clouds, providing rain for the earth, making grass grow on the hills.
19:147:9:He gives food to the animals, even to the young ravens when they cry out.
19:147:10:He doesn't delight in the strength of horses or take pleasure in human speed.
19:147:11:But the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear Him, who put their hope in His unfailing love.
19:147:12:Exalt the Lord, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!
19:147:13:For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your children within you.
19:147:14:He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest wheat.
19:147:15:He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.
19:147:16:He spreads snow like wool and scatters frost like ashes.
19:147:17:He hurls down hailstones like crumbs; who can withstand His icy cold?
19:147:18:He sends His word and melts them; He makes His wind blow, and the waters flow.
19:147:19:He reveals His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.
19:147:20:He has not done this for any other nation; they don't know His laws. Praise the Lord!
19:148:1:Praise the Lord from the heavens; celebrate Him in the heights above.
19:148:2:Glorify Him, all His angels; honor Him, every celestial being.
19:148:3:Extol Him, sun and moon; laud Him, shining stars.
19:148:4:Exalt Him, highest heavens; and you waters above the sky.
19:148:5:Let them praise the Lord's name, for He commanded, and they were created.
19:148:6:He established them forever and ever; setting boundaries they cannot cross.
19:148:7:Honor the Lord from the earth, great sea creatures and ocean depths;
19:148:8:Lightning and hail, snow and clouds, mighty winds fulfilling His word,
19:148:9:Mountains and hills, fruit trees and cedars,
19:148:10:Wild animals and cattle, creeping things and flying birds,
19:148:11:Kings of the earth and all nations, princes and rulers on earth,
19:148:12:Young men and women, old and young together.
19:148:13:Let them praise the Lord's name, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
19:148:14:He has raised up a horn for His people, a source of praise for all His faithful ones, for the people of Israel who are close to Him. Praise the Lord!

19:149:5:Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds.
19:149:6:May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands,
19:149:7:To execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
19:149:8:To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with iron shackles;
19:149:9:To carry out the judgment written against them. This is the honor for all His faithful ones. Praise the Lord!
19:150:1:Praise the Lord! Sing praises in His sanctuary; celebrate His mighty deeds in the heavens.
19:150:2:Extol Him for His powerful acts; honor Him for His boundless greatness.
19:150:3:Let the trumpet sound in His praise; worship Him with the harp and lyre.
19:150:4:Rejoice with tambourine and dance; adore Him with strings and flute.
19:150:5:Celebrate with resounding cymbals; make a joyful noise with crashing cymbals.
19:150:6:Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!
