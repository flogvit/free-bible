48:1:1:Paul, an apostle—not from human beings nor through a human being, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead—
48:1:2:and all the brothers and sisters with me, to the churches of Galatia:
48:1:3:Grace and peace be upon you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48:1:4:who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48:1:5:to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
48:1:6:I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
48:1:7:which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
48:1:8:But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse!
48:1:9:As we have already said, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let them be under God's curse!
48:1:10:Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48:1:11:For I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.
48:1:12:I did not receive it from any person, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it through a revelation from Jesus Christ.
48:1:13:You have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
48:1:14:I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
48:1:15:But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased
48:1:16:to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with any human being,
48:1:17:nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.
48:1:18:Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.
48:1:19:I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord's brother.
48:1:20:I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
48:1:21:Afterward, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
48:1:22:And I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
48:1:23:They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."
48:1:24:And they praised God because of me.
48:2:1:In chapter two of Galatians, Paul writes about his journey to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus. He went there because God had revealed to him that he should go, and he did so fourteen years after his first visit.
48:2:2:While in Jerusalem, Paul privately met with the leaders of the church to explain the gospel he was preaching to the non-Jewish people. He wanted to ensure that his work was not in vain.
48:2:3:Interestingly, Titus, who was a Greek and not circumcised, wasn't forced to undergo circumcision even though he accompanied Paul.
48:2:4:However, some false believers infiltrated the meeting to spy on the freedom that Christians have in Jesus Christ. Their aim was to bring them back into slavery under the law.
48:2:5:But Paul and his companions did not give in to these individuals, even for a moment. They stood firm so that the truth of the gospel would continue to be available for all believers.
48:2:6:As for the church leaders, they didn't add anything to Paul's message. They recognized that God had given him the responsibility to preach to the non-Jewish people, just as Peter had been called to preach to the Jews.
48:2:7:In fact, they saw that God was working through Paul just as He had worked through Peter.
48:2:8:God, who empowered Peter to be an apostle to the Jewish people, also empowered Paul to be an apostle to the non-Jewish people.
48:2:9:Recognizing this, James, Peter, and John – who were considered pillars of the church – extended their support to Paul and Barnabas. They agreed that Paul and Barnabas would continue their ministry among the non-Jewish people while they focused on the Jewish people.
48:2:10:Their only request was that Paul and his companions remember to help the poor, which was something they were already eager to do.
48:2:11:Later, when Peter visited Antioch, Paul confronted him publicly because he was acting hypocritically.
48:2:12:Before certain individuals arrived from James, Peter used to eat with non-Jewish believers. But when these individuals came, he withdrew from them out of fear of the circumcision group.
48:2:13:As a result, other Jewish believers also started behaving hypocritically, including Barnabas.
48:2:14:Seeing this, Paul confronted Peter in front of everyone, asking him why he expected non-Jewish believers to follow Jewish customs when he himself was not consistently living by them.
48:2:15:Paul then reminded them that they were all Jews by birth, not sinners from among the non-Jewish people.
48:2:16:However, they knew that no one could be justified by following the law but only through faith in Jesus Christ. So they had put their faith in Christ to be made right with God, and not by observing the law, for no one is justified by the law.
48:2:17:If, while seeking to be justified in Christ, they were found to be sinners, it would not mean that Christ promotes sin. Absolutely not!
48:2:18:In fact, if Paul were to rebuild the very system of law that he had dismantled, he would be proving himself a lawbreaker.
48:2:19:Through the law, Paul died to the law so that he might live for God.
48:2:20:He was crucified with Christ, and now he no longer lived, but Christ lived in him. The life he lived in his body, he lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved him and gave himself for him.
48:2:21:Paul concluded by saying that he would not nullify God's grace. If righteousness could be achieved through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
48:3:1:You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.
48:3:2:I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
48:3:3:Are you so senseless? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now trying to be made perfect by human effort?
48:3:4:Did you experience so much in vain—if indeed it was in vain?
48:3:5:So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?
48:3:6:Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,
48:3:7:know then that those who have faith are the true children of Abraham.
48:3:8:The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all the nations will be blessed."
48:3:9:So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
48:3:10:For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."
48:3:11:Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith."
48:3:12:The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, "The person who does these things will live by them."
48:3:13:Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."
48:3:14:He did this so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, and we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
48:3:15:Brothers and sisters, let me use an example from everyday life: No one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established.
48:3:16:The promises were spoken to Abraham and his offspring. The Scripture does not say "and to offsprings," meaning many people, but "and to your offspring," meaning one person, who is Christ.
48:3:17:What I am saying is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not nullify the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
48:3:18:For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
48:3:19:Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the arrival of the offspring to whom the promise referred. It was ordained through angels by a mediator.
48:3:20:A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
48:3:21:Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
48:3:22:But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
48:3:23:Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
48:3:24:So the law was our guardian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith.
48:3:25:Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
48:3:26:For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus,
48:3:27:for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48:3:28:There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48:3:29:If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, and heirs according to the promise.
48:4:1:Now, I want you to understand that as long as an heir is a child, they have no more authority than a slave, even though they are the owner of everything.
48:4:2:They remain under guardians and managers until the time set by their father.
48:4:3:In the same way, we were once children, held captive under the basic principles of the world.
48:4:4:But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
48:4:5:to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive our status as adopted children.
48:4:6:And because you are now his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"
48:4:7:So you're no longer a slave, but a child; and if a child, then also an heir through God.
48:4:8:Before you knew God, you served those who by nature are not gods at all.
48:4:9:But now that you know God—or rather, are known by God—how can you turn back to those weak and worthless principles? Do you want to be enslaved by them all over again?
48:4:10:You observe special days, months, seasons, and years.
48:4:11:I am concerned for you, afraid that my efforts for you may have been wasted.
48:4:12:I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.
48:4:13:As you know, it was because of a physical illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
48:4:14:Even though my condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus himself.
48:4:15:Where is that sense of blessing you once had? For I testify that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48:4:16:Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48:4:17:These people are zealous to win you over, but not for good reasons. They want to exclude you, so that you may be zealous for them.
48:4:18:It's always good to be zealous for a good cause, and not only when I am with you.
48:4:19:My dear children, I am in labor again for you until Christ is formed in you.
48:4:20:I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
48:4:21:Tell me, those of you who desire to be under the law, don't you understand what the law says?
48:4:22:For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
48:4:23:The son of the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through the promise.
48:4:24:These things can be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and gives birth to children who are to be slaves; this is Hagar.
48:4:25:Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48:4:26:But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
48:4:27:For it is written, "Rejoice, barren woman who does not give birth; break forth and shout, you who have no labor pains, because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has a husband."
48:4:28:Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48:4:29:At that time, the son born according to the flesh persecuted the one born through the Spirit. It is the same now.
48:4:30:But what does Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."
48:4:31:So then, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
48:5:1:You are called to freedom, my friends; just don't use this freedom as an excuse for indulging your selfish desires, but instead serve one another through love.
48:5:2:The whole law can be summed up in this single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."
48:5:3:But if you keep attacking and hurting each other, watch out or you'll end up destroying one another.
48:5:4:So I encourage you, live by the guidance of the Spirit and you won't give in to the desires of your lower nature.
48:5:5:For these desires are at odds with the Spirit, and the Spirit opposes them. They're in conflict with each other, so you can't do what you truly want.
48:5:6:But when you're led by the Spirit, you're no longer under the law's control.
48:5:7:The acts of our lower nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,
48:5:8:idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,
48:5:9:envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and similar things. I've warned you before, and I warn you again: those who live like this will not inherit God's kingdom.
48:5:10:But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48:5:11:gentleness, and self-control. Against such things, there is no law.
48:5:12:Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their lower nature with its passions and desires.
48:5:13:Since we live by the Spirit, let's also walk in step with the Spirit.
48:5:14:Let's not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
48:6:1:Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you may also be tempted.
48:6:2:Carry each other's burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48:6:3:For if anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
48:6:4:Each person should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to others.
48:6:5:For each one should carry their own load.
48:6:6:Nevertheless, those who receive instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.
48:6:7:Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A person reaps what they sow.
48:6:8:Those who sow to please their sinful nature will reap destruction; those who sow to please the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
48:6:9:Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
48:6:10:Therefore, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
48:6:11:See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
48:6:12:Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48:6:13:Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.
48:6:14:May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48:6:15:Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
48:6:16:Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
48:6:17:From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
48:6:18:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
