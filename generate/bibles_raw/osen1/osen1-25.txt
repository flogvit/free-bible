25:1:1:How lonely sits the city that was once full of people! She has become like a widow, once great among the nations. A princess among the provinces, she is now forced to work as a slave.
25:1:2:Bitterly she weeps in the night, her tears streaming down her cheeks. Among all her lovers, there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her and become her enemies.
25:1:3:Judah has gone into exile under affliction and harsh slavery. She dwells among the nations but finds no rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
25:1:4:The roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the appointed festivals. All her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she herself suffers bitterly.
25:1:5:Her adversaries have become her masters; her enemies prosper. The Lord has brought sorrow upon her because of her many rebellions. Her children have gone away, captured by the enemy.
25:1:6:All the splendor has vanished from Daughter Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; they lack strength to flee in the face of the hunter.
25:1:7:In the days of her affliction and homelessness, Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in the days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked on and laughed at her downfall.
25:1:8:Jerusalem has sinned greatly, and so she has become an object of scorn. All who honored her now despise her, for they have seen her nakedness. She herself groans and turns away.
25:1:9:Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her downfall was astounding; there was no one to comfort her. "Lord, look upon my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."
25:1:10:The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary—those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
25:1:11:All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, Lord, and consider, for I have become despised."
25:1:12:"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see if there is any suffering like mine, which the Lord brought on me when he vented his fierce anger."
25:1:13:From above he sent fire, which penetrated my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
25:1:14:The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; they are woven together and hung around my neck. He has sapped my strength; the Lord has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.
25:1:15:The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress, the Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah.
25:1:16:For these things, I weep; my eyes overflow with tears. For there is no one nearby to comfort me, no one to revive my soul. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.
25:1:17:Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The Lord has decreed judgment on Jacob, and his neighbors have become his foes. Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
25:1:18:"The Lord is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and young women have gone into captivity.
25:1:19:I called to my allies, but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while searching for food to keep themselves alive.
25:1:20:See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.
25:1:21:People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
25:1:22:Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many, and my heart is faint."
25:2:1:How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has thrown down Israel's splendor from heaven to earth; he did not remember his footstool on the day of his anger.
25:2:2:Without pity, the Lord swallowed up all of Jacob's dwellings. In his wrath, he tore down the strongholds of Daughter Judah; he brought them down to the ground. He dishonored the kingdom and its leaders.
25:2:3:Fiercely, he broke off every horn of Israel in his burning rage. He withdrew his right hand when facing the enemy, and blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire consuming everything around.
25:2:4:Like an enemy, he bent his bow; his right hand was poised. He killed all who were pleasant to the eye; in the tent of Daughter Zion, he poured out his wrath like fire.
25:2:5:The Lord became like an enemy; he devoured Israel, swallowing up all her palaces, destroying her strongholds, and filling the people of Judah with grief and lamentation.
25:2:6:Violently, he destroyed his dwelling place, like a garden; he eliminated his appointed feasts and Sabbaths in Zion. In his fierce anger, he rejected both king and priest.
25:2:7:The Lord abandoned his altar, despising his sanctuary. He handed over the walls of her palaces to the enemy; they shouted in the house of the Lord as if it were a festival day.
25:2:8:Determined to destroy, the Lord tore down the wall of Daughter Zion; he stretched out a measuring line and did not restrain his hand from destroying. Rampart and wall mourned together; they were ruined.
25:2:9:Her gates sank into the ground; he demolished and broke her bars. Her king and her princes were exiled among the nations; there was no more guidance. Her prophets found no vision from the Lord.
25:2:10:Silently, the elders of Daughter Zion sat on the ground; they threw dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem bowed their heads to the ground.
25:2:11:Tears streamed from my eyes, my heart was in turmoil, my spirit poured out in anguish because of the destruction of my people, as children and infants fainted in the streets of the city.
25:2:12:They cried out to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they fainted like wounded men in the streets of the city, their lives ebbing away in their mothers' arms.
25:2:13:What can I say for you, O Daughter Jerusalem? To what can I compare you? What can I liken you to, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea; who can heal you?
25:2:14:The visions your prophets had for you were empty and deceptive; they did not reveal your guilt to avert your fate. They prophesied lies and false hopes, leading you astray.
25:2:15:All who pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem, saying, "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"
25:2:16:Your enemies opened their mouths wide against you; they hiss and gnash their teeth, saying, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have finally seen it."
25:2:17:The Lord has done what he planned; he fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity; he let the enemy gloat over you and exalted the horn of your foes.
25:2:18:Cry out to the Lord, O wall of Daughter Zion! Let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no rest, and let not the apple of your eye cease.
25:2:19:Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
25:2:20:Look, O Lord, and consider! To whom have you done this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
25:2:21:Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.
25:2:22:As if on a feast day, you have summoned terrors from all around, and in the day of the Lord's anger, no one escaped or survived. Those I cared for and raised, my enemy has destroyed.
25:3:1:I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
25:3:2:He has led me and made me walk in darkness, not in light.
25:3:3:Against me he has turned his hand repeatedly, all day long.
25:3:4:My flesh and my skin he has worn away; he has broken my bones.
25:3:5:He has besieged and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
25:3:6:In dark places, he has made me dwell like those long dead.
25:3:7:He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.
25:3:8:Even when I cry out for help, he shuts out my prayer.
25:3:9:He has blocked my path with hewn stones; he has twisted my ways.
25:3:10:Like a bear lying in wait or a lion in hiding, he is to me.
25:3:11:He has dragged me off the path and torn me to pieces, leaving me desolate.
25:3:12:He has drawn his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
25:3:13:He has pierced my heart with the shafts of his quiver.
25:3:14:I have become a laughingstock to all my people, mocked by their songs all day long.
25:3:15:He has filled me with bitterness, drenched me with wormwood.
25:3:16:He has ground my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.
25:3:17:My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is.
25:3:18:So I say, "My strength is gone, and my hope in the Lord has vanished."
25:3:19:Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall.
25:3:20:My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me.
25:3:21:But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:
25:3:22:The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end.
25:3:23:They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
25:3:24:"The Lord is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."
25:3:25:The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
25:3:26:It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.
25:3:27:It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.
25:3:28:Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid upon him.
25:3:29:Let him put his mouth in the dust—perhaps there is hope.
25:3:30:Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes, and be filled with disgrace.
25:3:31:For the Lord will not reject us forever.
25:3:32:Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.
25:3:33:For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.
25:3:34:To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,
25:3:35:To deny a man justice before the Most High,
25:3:36:To subvert a man in his lawsuit— the Lord does not approve.
25:3:37:Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not commanded it?
25:3:38:Do not both calamities and good things come from the mouth of the Most High?
25:3:39:Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?
25:3:40:Let us examine our ways and test them, and return to the Lord.
25:3:41:Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven.
25:3:42:We have sinned and rebelled; you have not forgiven.
25:3:43:You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.
25:3:44:You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.
25:3:45:You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
25:3:46:All our enemies open their mouths wide against us.
25:3:47:Panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction.
25:3:48:Streams of tears flow from my eyes because of the destruction of my people.
25:3:49:My eyes will flow without ceasing
25:3:50:without relief, until the Lord looks down and sees from heaven.
25:3:51:My eyes bring suffering to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
25:3:52:Without cause, my enemies hunted me down like a bird.
25:3:53:They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me.
25:3:54:Waters flowed over my head; I thought I was finished.
25:3:55:I called on your name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit.
25:3:56:You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."
25:3:57:You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."
25:3:58:You, Lord, took up my case; you redeemed my life.
25:3:59:Lord, you have seen the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!
25:3:60:You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.
25:3:61:Lord, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me.
25:3:62:The whispers and murmurs of my assailants are against me all day long.
25:3:63:Look at them! Whether they sit or stand, they mock me in their songs.
25:3:64:Pay them back, Lord, according to their deeds.
25:3:65:Give them a heart filled with anguish; may your curse be upon them!
25:3:66:Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord.
25:4:1:How the gold has lost its luster, and the fine gold become dull! The sacred stones lie scattered at every street corner.
25:4:2:The precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now regarded as clay pots, the work of a potter's hands.
25:4:3:Even jackals provide for their young, but the daughters of my people have become cruel like ostriches in the desert.
25:4:4:The infant's tongue clings to the roof of its mouth due to thirst; little children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.
25:4:5:Those who once feasted on delicacies are now starving in the streets; those who were raised in luxury now cling to garbage heaps.
25:4:6:The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand laid on it.
25:4:7:Her princes were once purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, their appearance like sapphire.
25:4:8:But now their faces are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones; it has become as dry as wood.
25:4:9:Those slain by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger; they waste away, pierced with pain because the fields lack produce.
25:4:10:Compassionate women have cooked their own children; they became food during the destruction of my people.
25:4:11:The Lord has vented his wrath, pouring out his fierce anger; he kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.
25:4:12:No one would have believed that enemies or foes could ever enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25:4:13:It was because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests that they shed the blood of the righteous within her.
25:4:14:Blindly they wandered through the streets, defiled by blood; no one could touch their garments.
25:4:15:"Go away! You are unclean!" people shouted at them. "Away! Away! Don't touch us!" So they fled and wandered. The nations said, "They can stay here no longer."
25:4:16:The Lord himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are not respected, the elders find no favor.
25:4:17:Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; we watched from our towers for a nation that could not save us.
25:4:18:People stalked us at every step, so we couldn't walk in our streets. Our end drew near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.
25:4:19:Swifter than eagles were our pursuers; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
25:4:20:The Lord's anointed, our very life breath, was captured in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.
25:4:21:Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup will pass; you will become drunk and stripped naked.
25:4:22:Your punishment is complete, O daughter of Zion; he will not prolong your exile. But he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, and expose your sins.
25:5:1:Lord, remember what has happened to us; look and see our disgrace.
25:5:2:Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.
25:5:3:We have become orphans without a father; our mothers are like widows.
25:5:4:We must pay for the water we drink; our wood comes at a price.
25:5:5:We are pursued relentlessly; we are exhausted and given no rest.
25:5:6:We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria just to get enough food.
25:5:7:Our ancestors sinned, and they are no more; but we bear their punishment.
25:5:8:Servants rule over us; there is no one to rescue us from their control.
25:5:9:We risk our lives to gather food in the face of the desert's sword.
25:5:10:Our skin is scorched like an oven because of the burning heat of famine.
25:5:11:Women in Zion have been violated; virgins in the cities of Judah.
25:5:12:Princes have been hung by their hands; elders are shown no respect.
25:5:13:Young men labor at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.
25:5:14:The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.
25:5:15:Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
25:5:16:The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!
25:5:17:Because of this our hearts are sick, and our eyes grow dim with tears.
25:5:18:Mount Zion lies desolate, with jackals prowling about.
25:5:19:But you, Lord, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.
25:5:20:Why have you forgotten us completely? Why have you forsaken us for so long?
25:5:21:Restore us to yourself, Lord, that we may return; renew our days as of old.
25:5:22:Unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.
