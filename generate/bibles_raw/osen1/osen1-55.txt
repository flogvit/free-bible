55:1:1:Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
55:1:2:To my dear friend Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
55:1:3:I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience like my ancestors did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day.
55:1:4:Longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,
55:1:5:I am reminded of the sincere faith within you, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced it now lives in you as well.
55:1:6:For this reason, I encourage you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.
55:1:7:God has not given us a spirit of fear, but one of power, love, and self-discipline.
55:1:8:So don't be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or me, his prisoner. Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God.
55:1:9:He saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
55:1:10:but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
55:1:11:For this gospel, I was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher.
55:1:12:That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
55:1:13:Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
55:1:14:Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
55:1:15:You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
55:1:16:May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
55:1:17:On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.
55:1:18:May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well how much he helped me in Ephesus.
55:2:1:My child, be strong in the grace that is found in Jesus Christ.
55:2:2:And the things you've heard from me among many witnesses, pass on to trustworthy people who will also be able to teach others.
55:2:3:Endure hardship like a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
55:2:4:A soldier on duty doesn't get entangled in everyday affairs; they aim to please the one who enlisted them.
55:2:5:Similarly, if someone competes as an athlete, they won't win the prize unless they follow the rules.
55:2:6:The hardworking farmer should be the first to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
55:2:7:Consider what I'm saying, and the Lord will give you understanding in all this.
55:2:8:Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David—this is my gospel.
55:2:9:For this message, I suffer even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.
55:2:10:That's why I endure everything for the sake of the chosen ones, so they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
55:2:11:This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we'll also live with him.
55:2:12:If we endure, we'll also reign with him. If we deny him, he'll deny us.
55:2:13:If we're unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
55:2:14:Remind people of these things, and charge them before God not to argue about words, which leads to no benefit and only ruins those who listen.
55:2:15:Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
55:2:16:Avoid pointless and empty chatter, for it will lead to more ungodliness,
55:2:17:and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
55:2:18:who have strayed from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and they're undermining some people's faith.
55:2:19:Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
55:2:20:In a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and clay ones; some for honorable use, others for dishonorable.
55:2:21:If anyone cleanses themselves from what is dishonorable, they'll be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
55:2:22:Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.
55:2:23:Avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
55:2:24:A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,
55:2:25:correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth,
55:2:26:and they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
55:3:1:Remember that in the last days, difficult times will come.
55:3:2:People will be self-centered, greedy for money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, and unholy.
55:3:3:They'll lack affection, refuse to make peace, slander others, lack self-control, be brutal, and hate what is good.
55:3:4:Traitors, reckless, conceited, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God will emerge.
55:3:5:Although they'll maintain a form of godliness, they'll deny its power. Stay away from such people.
55:3:6:Among them are those who creep into households and captivate vulnerable women weighed down by sins, led astray by various desires.
55:3:7:These women are always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
55:3:8:Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people oppose the truth—men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.
55:3:9:But they won't get far because their folly will become obvious to everyone, just like it did with Jannes and Jambres.
55:3:10:However, you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, and endurance.
55:3:11:You've also witnessed my persecutions and sufferings in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from all of them.
55:3:12:Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
55:3:13:Evil people and impostors will grow worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves.
55:3:14:But as for you, continue in what you've learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it.
55:3:15:Since childhood, you have known the Holy Scriptures, which can make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
55:3:16:All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness,
55:3:17:so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
55:4:1:In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom, I urge you:
55:4:2:Preach the message; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and careful instruction.
55:4:3:For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine; instead, they'll gather around themselves teachers to suit their own desires, wanting to hear what their itching ears want.
55:4:4:They will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths.
55:4:5:But you, stay alert in all things, endure hardships, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
55:4:6:As for me, my life is already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near.
55:4:7:I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful.
55:4:8:Now there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
55:4:9:Make every effort to come to me soon,
55:4:10:because Demas, in his love for this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
55:4:11:Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
55:4:12:I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
55:4:13:When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus at Troas, and also the scrolls, especially the parchments.
55:4:14:Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
55:4:15:Be on your guard against him, for he strongly opposed our message.
55:4:16:At my first defense, no one came to support me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
55:4:17:But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.
55:4:18:The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
55:4:19:Greet Prisca and Aquila, as well as the household of Onesiphorus.
55:4:20:Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
55:4:21:Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.
55:4:22:The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
