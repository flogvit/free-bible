63:1:1:The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,
63:1:2:For the sake of the truth that lives within us and will be with us forever:
63:1:3:Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.
63:1:4:I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
63:1:5:And now, dear lady, I request you—not as though I were writing a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.
63:1:6:This is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
63:1:7:Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.
63:1:8:Be on guard, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but instead receive a full reward.
63:1:9:Anyone who goes too far and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son.
63:1:10:If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome them into your house or give them any greeting.
63:1:11:For whoever greets such a person shares in their evil deeds.
63:1:12:Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
63:1:13:The children of your chosen sister greet you.
