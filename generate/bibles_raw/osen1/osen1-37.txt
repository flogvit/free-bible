37:1:1:In the second year of King Darius, during the sixth month, on the first day, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, addressing Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
37:1:2:"This is what the Lord Almighty says: These people claim that the time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord's house."
37:1:3:Then the word of the Lord came through Haggai the prophet:
37:1:4:"Is it a suitable time for you to live in your luxurious homes while this house lies in ruins?"
37:1:5:Now, the Lord Almighty declares: "Consider your ways!
37:1:6:You have sown much but harvested little; you eat but never have enough; you drink but remain thirsty; you put on clothes but are not warm; and the wages you earn are stored in bags with holes."
37:1:7:Thus says the Lord Almighty: "Reflect on your actions!
37:1:8:Go up to the mountains, bring wood, and rebuild the temple so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored," says the Lord.
37:1:9:"You were expecting much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?" declares the Lord Almighty. "Because my house lies in ruins while each of you is busy with your own house.
37:1:10:That is why the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops.
37:1:11:I have called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands."
37:1:12:Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of Haggai the prophet because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the Lord.
37:1:13:Haggai, the Lord's messenger, delivered the Lord's message to the people: "I am with you," declares the Lord.
37:1:14:So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began work on the house of the Lord Almighty, their God,
37:1:15:on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.
37:2:1:On the 21st day of the seventh month, the Lord spoke through Haggai the prophet, saying:
37:2:2:"Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remaining people, asking:
37:2:3:'Who among you has seen this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem like nothing in comparison?
37:2:4:But now, be strong, Zerubbabel,' declares the Lord. 'Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' declares the Lord. 'Work, for I am with you,' says the Lord Almighty.
37:2:5:'This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains among you; do not fear.'
37:2:6:For this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'In a little while, I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
37:2:7:I will shake all nations, and the treasures of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the Lord Almighty.
37:2:8:'The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' declares the Lord Almighty.
37:2:9:'The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,' says the Lord Almighty. 'And in this place, I will grant peace,' declares the Lord Almighty."
37:2:10:On the 24th day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying:
37:2:11:"This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Ask the priests for a ruling about the law:
37:2:12:If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy?'" The priests answered, "No."
37:2:13:Then Haggai said, "If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?" "Yes," the priests replied, "it becomes defiled."
37:2:14:So Haggai said, "This is how it is with this people and this nation in my sight," declares the Lord. "Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.
37:2:15:Now give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord's temple.
37:2:16:When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.
37:2:17:I struck you—all the work of your hands—with blight, mildew, and hail, yet you did not turn to me,' declares the Lord.
37:2:18:'From this day on, from the 24th day of the ninth month, consider the day when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid. Consider it carefully.
37:2:19:Is there still seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not borne fruit. But from this day on, I will bless you.'"
37:2:20:The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the 24th day of the month, saying:
37:2:21:"Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth.
37:2:22:I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.
37:2:23:'On that day,' declares the Lord Almighty, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares the Lord, 'and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,' declares the Lord Almighty."
