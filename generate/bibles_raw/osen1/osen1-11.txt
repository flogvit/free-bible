11:1:1:Now, King David was old and advanced in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm.
11:1:2:So his servants said to him, "Let us find a young virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him, lie in his arms, and keep him warm."
11:1:3:They searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag the Shunammite, bringing her to the king.
11:1:4:The young woman was very beautiful, and she attended to the king and took care of him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.
11:1:5:Adonijah, son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." He prepared chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
11:1:6:His father had never disciplined him by asking, "Why have you done this?" Adonijah was also very handsome, born after Absalom.
11:1:7:He conferred with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and Abiathar the priest, who supported Adonijah's bid for kingship.
11:1:8:However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty men did not side with Adonijah.
11:1:9:Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah.
11:1:10:But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon, his brother.
11:1:11:Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, saying, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowledge?
11:1:12:Now let me give you advice, so that you may save your life and the life of your son Solomon.
11:1:13:Go to King David and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, "Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'
11:1:14:While you are still speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words."
11:1:15:Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.
11:1:16:Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king. The king asked, "What do you want?"
11:1:17:She replied, "My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your servant, 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'
11:1:18:But now, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, are unaware of it.
11:1:19:He has sacrificed many oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep, inviting all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he did not invite Solomon, your servant.
11:1:20:You, my lord the king, must decide who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
11:1:21:Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be considered criminals."
11:1:22:While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
11:1:23:The king was informed, "Nathan the prophet is here." Nathan entered the king's presence and bowed down before him with his face to the ground.
11:1:24:Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you declared that Adonijah shall be king after you and sit on your throne?
11:1:25:Today he has gone down and sacrificed many oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. They are eating and drinking in his presence, proclaiming, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
11:1:26:But me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Solomon, your servant, he did not invite.
11:1:27:Has this decision been made by my lord the king, and you have not informed your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11:1:28:King David responded, "Summon Bathsheba to me." She came into the king's presence and stood before him.
11:1:29:The king swore an oath, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has delivered me from every trouble,
11:1:30:I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."
11:1:31:Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, paying homage to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
11:1:32:King David then said, "Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." They came before the king,
11:1:33:and he instructed them, "Take my servants with you, have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.
11:1:34:There, let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and declare, 'Long live King Solomon!'
11:1:35:Then return with him, and he will come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
11:1:36:Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so too.
11:1:37:As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
11:1:38:So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule, taking him to Gihon.
11:1:39:Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people proclaimed, "Long live King Solomon!"
11:1:40:All the people followed him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, making the ground shake with their noise.
11:1:41:Adonijah and all his guests heard the commotion as they finished their feast. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, "Why is the city in such an uproar?"
11:1:42:While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and must be bringing good news."
11:1:43:But Jonathan answered Adonijah, "No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
11:1:44:The king sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites with him, and they had him ride on the king's mule.
11:1:45:Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king at Gihon, and they have returned from there rejoicing, so the city is in an uproar. That is the noise you hear.
11:1:46:Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
11:1:47:The king's servants have gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than your throne!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed,
11:1:48:saying, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted someone to sit on my throne today, while my own eyes have seen it.'"
11:1:49:Then all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed.
11:1:50:Adonijah, fearing Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11:1:51:Solomon was informed, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"
11:1:52:Solomon replied, "If he proves to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."
11:1:53:So King Solomon sent for Adonijah, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and paid homage to King Solomon, who said to him, "Go to your home."
11:2:1:As David's time to die approached, he gave his son Solomon these instructions:
11:2:2:"I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong and show yourself a man.
11:2:3:Follow the Lord your God's commands, obeying His laws and decrees, as written in the Law of Moses. By doing this, you will prosper in all you do and wherever you go.
11:2:4:If you remain faithful, the Lord will keep the promise He made to me: 'If your descendants live according to My teachings, their kingdom over Israel will be secure forever.'"
11:2:5:David also said, "You know what Joab, son of Zeruiah, did to me and how he killed two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner and Amasa. Repay him for his actions, so that his blood is not on my head or my descendants'.
11:2:6:Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table, for they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
11:2:7:But Shimei, son of Gera, cursed me with terrible curses when I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord that I would not put him to death. Now, don't let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man and know how to deal with him."
11:2:8:Then David passed away and was buried in the city of David.
11:2:9:Solomon became king after his father David, and his reign was firmly established.
11:2:10:Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come peacefully?" He replied, "Yes, peacefully."
11:2:11:Adonijah continued, "I have something to say to you." Bathsheba responded, "Go ahead."
11:2:12:He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine and all Israel expected me to be king, but things changed, and the kingdom went to my brother because it was the Lord's will.
11:2:13:Now I have one request. Please don't refuse me." Bathsheba replied, "What is it?"
11:2:14:Adonijah said, "Please ask King Solomon to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife, for he won't refuse you."
11:2:15:Bathsheba agreed and went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah's behalf. The king stood up to meet her, bowed to her, and then sat on his throne. He ordered a throne to be brought for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.
11:2:16:Bathsheba said, "I have a small request. Please don't deny me." The king replied, "Ask, my mother, and I won't refuse you."
11:2:17:She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife."
11:2:18:King Solomon answered, "Why do you request Abishag for Adonijah? You might as well ask for the entire kingdom for him since he is my older brother! This includes Abiathar the priest and Joab, son of Zeruiah!"
11:2:19:Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, "May God punish me if Adonijah doesn't pay with his life for this request!
11:2:20:Now, as the Lord lives, who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and fulfilled His promise, today Adonijah will be executed."
11:2:21:So King Solomon ordered Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, to kill Adonijah, and he did.
11:2:22:Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you now because you carried the ark of the Lord before my father David and suffered during all the hardships my father faced."
11:2:23:Solomon removed Abiathar from being the Lord's priest, fulfilling the Lord's prophecy against Eli's family in Shiloh.
11:2:24:When Joab heard about Adonijah's death, he fled to the tent of the Lord and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar, fearing Solomon would kill him too.
11:2:25:King Solomon heard that Joab had fled to the Lord's tent and was beside the altar. He sent Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, with orders to kill Joab.
11:2:26:Benaiah went to the Lord's tent and said, "The king commands you to come out." But Joab replied, "No, I will die here." So Benaiah reported back to the king.
11:2:27:The king told Benaiah, "Do as he says. Kill him there and bury him, so that his blood is no longer on me or my father's family.
11:2:28:The Lord will repay Joab for the blood he shed, which stains the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet."
11:2:29:So Benaiah killed Joab and buried him in the desert.
11:2:30:Then the king appointed Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, as commander of the army in Joab's place and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
11:2:31:Shimei, who had cursed David, was also summoned by the king. Solomon said to him, "Build a house in Jerusalem and live there, but don't leave the city.
11:2:32:If you ever cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain that you will die, and your blood will be on your own head."
11:2:33:Shimei agreed, saying, "Your judgment is fair, my lord the king." So he lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
11:2:34:But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maakah, king of Gath. When Shimei learned where they were,
11:2:35:he saddled his donkey and went to Gath to retrieve them. King Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and returned.
11:2:36:The king summoned Shimei and asked, "Didn't I make you swear by the Lord and warn you not to leave Jerusalem? Why did you disobey my command?"
11:2:37:Shimei replied, "I know I have sinned, so I've come back to accept your punishment."
11:2:38:King Solomon said, "You sealed your fate with your own words. Benaiah, execute him." And Benaiah killed Shimei.
11:2:39:Thus, Solomon secured his kingdom and established himself on his father David's throne.
11:3:1:Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the city of David until he finished building his own house, the house of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.
11:3:2:Meanwhile, the people were sacrificing at the high places because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days.
11:3:3:Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places.
11:3:4:The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the most important high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
11:3:5:At Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, "Ask what I should give you."
11:3:6:Solomon replied, "You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David, my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart toward you. You have continued this great and steadfast love for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne today.
11:3:7:Now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David, but I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
11:3:8:Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted.
11:3:9:Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, able to discern between good and evil; for who can govern this great people of yours?"
11:3:10:It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.
11:3:11:God said to him, "Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,
11:3:12:I now do according to your word. Indeed, I give you a wise and discerning mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you shall arise after you.
11:3:13:I will also give you what you have not asked, both riches and honor all your life; no other king shall compare with you.
11:3:14:If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."
11:3:15:Solomon awoke; it had been a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He offered up burnt offerings and offerings of well-being, and provided a feast for all his servants.
11:3:16:Later, two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
11:3:17:The first woman said, "My lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.
11:3:18:On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together; there was no one else with us in the house, only the two of us were in the house.
11:3:19:During the night, this woman's child died because she lay on it.
11:3:20:She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your servant slept. She laid him at her breast, and laid her dead child at my breast.
11:3:21:When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, I saw that he was dead; but when I looked at him closely in the morning, it was not the son I had borne."
11:3:22:The other woman said, "No! The living son is mine, and the dead son is yours." But the first woman said, "No! The dead son is yours, and the living son is mine." So they argued before the king.
11:3:23:Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son that is alive, and your son is the dead one'; and the other says, 'No! Your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'"
11:3:24:The king continued, "Bring me a sword." So they brought a sword before the king.
11:3:25:He then ordered, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11:3:26:But the woman whose son was alive said to the king—because compassion for her son burned within her—"Please, my lord, give her the living child; certainly do not kill him!" The other said, "It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it."
11:3:27:Then the king responded, "Give the first woman the living child; do not kill him. She is his mother."
11:3:28:All Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered; and they stood in awe of the king because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice.
11:4:1:King Solomon ruled over all of Israel.
11:4:2:These were his high officials: Azariah son of Zadok, the priest;
11:4:3:Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha, as secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud, as recorder;
11:4:4:Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar, priests;
11:4:5:Azariah son of Nathan, in charge of the officers; Zabud son of Nathan, a priest and personal advisor to the king;
11:4:6:Ahishar, responsible for the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda, in charge of forced labor.
11:4:7:Solomon had twelve district governors over all of Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.
11:4:8:These are their names: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
11:4:9:Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-bethhanan;
11:4:10:Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth (he had Socoh and all the land of Hepher);
11:4:11:Ben-Abinadab, in Naphath-dor (he was married to Taphath, daughter of Solomon);
11:4:12:Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah across to Jokmeam;
11:4:13:Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob in Bashan with its sixty large fortified cities with walls and bronze gates);
11:4:14:Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
11:4:15:Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he had married Basemath, daughter of Solomon);
11:4:16:Baanah son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
11:4:17:Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar;
11:4:18:Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin;
11:4:19:Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. He was the only governor over the district.
11:4:20:The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, drank, and were happy.
11:4:21:Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and served Solomon all his life.
11:4:22:Solomon's daily provisions included thirty cors of fine flour, sixty cors of meal,
11:4:23:ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed cattle, a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and choice fowl.
11:4:24:He ruled over everything west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and over all the kings west of the Euphrates. He had peace on all sides around him.
11:4:25:During Solomon's reign, Judah and Israel lived in safety, from Dan to Beersheba, each person under their own vine and fig tree.
11:4:26:Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses and twelve thousand horses.
11:4:27:The district governors, each in their month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
11:4:28:They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it was required, each according to his responsibility.
11:4:29:God gave Solomon wisdom, insight, and understanding beyond measure, as vast as the sand on the seashore.
11:4:30:Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.
11:4:31:He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame spread throughout all the surrounding nations.
11:4:32:Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
11:4:33:He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
11:4:34:People came from all nations to hear Solomon's wisdom, sent by kings who had heard of his wisdom.
11:5:1:Now, Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him as king in place of his father, because Hiram had always been a friend of David.
11:5:2:Solomon sent a message back to Hiram, saying,
11:5:3:"You know that my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars surrounding him until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
11:5:4:But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.
11:5:5:And so I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.'
11:5:6:Therefore, please command that cedars from Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that none among us can cut timber like the Sidonians."
11:5:7:When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the Lord this day, who has given David a wise son to rule over this great people!"
11:5:8:Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have considered the things you sent to me for, and I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber.
11:5:9:My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate. There, I will have them broken up, and you can take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by providing food for my household."
11:5:10:So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he desired,
11:5:11:while Solomon provided Hiram with twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty thousand cors of pressed oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year after year.
11:5:12:The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, just as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made a treaty together.
11:5:13:King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel; the levy numbered thirty thousand men.
11:5:14:He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
11:5:15:Solomon also had seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills,
11:5:16:not including his chief officers who were over the work—three thousand three hundred supervisors who directed the laborers.
11:5:17:At the king's command, they quarried large stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones.
11:5:18:So Solomon's builders, Hiram's builders, and the Gebalites cut and prepared the timber and stone for the construction of the house.
11:6:1:In the 480th year after the Israelites left Egypt, during Solomon's fourth year as king of Israel, in the month of Ziv (which is the second month), he began to build the temple for the Lord.
11:6:2:The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
11:6:3:The porch at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is, 30 feet, and projected outward 15 feet from the entrance.
11:6:4:Solomon made windows with specially designed frames for the temple,
11:6:5:and built a structure against the walls of the temple, surrounding both the main hall and the inner sanctuary. He constructed side rooms all around.
11:6:6:The lower floor was 7.5 feet wide, the middle floor 9 feet wide, and the third floor 10.5 feet wide. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.
11:6:7:When the temple was being built, only stones shaped at the quarry were used; no hammers, chisels, or any other iron tools were heard at the temple construction site.
11:6:8:The entrance to the lowest side room was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third.
11:6:9:So Solomon built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
11:6:10:Then he built the side rooms all along the temple, each 15 feet high, and they were attached to the temple by cedar beams.
11:6:11:Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
11:6:12:"Concerning this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill my promise to you, which I made to your father David.
11:6:13:I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."
11:6:14:So Solomon built the temple and finished it.
11:6:15:He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper.
11:6:16:He partitioned off 30 feet at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
11:6:17:The main hall in front of this room was 60 feet long.
11:6:18:The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.
11:6:19:Solomon prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there.
11:6:20:The inner sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
11:6:21:Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
11:6:22:So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
11:6:23:For the inner sanctuary, he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each 15 feet high.
11:6:24:One wing of the first cherub was 7.5 feet long, and the other wing 7.5 feet long. The full wingspan was 15 feet from tip to tip.
11:6:25:The second cherub also measured 15 feet; both cherubim had the same size and shape.
11:6:26:The height of each cherub was 15 feet.
11:6:27:He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
11:6:28:He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
11:6:29:On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
11:6:30:He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
11:6:31:For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made doors out of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.
11:6:32:On the two olive-wood doors, he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, hammering the gold onto the cherubim and palm trees.
11:6:33:In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall, he made doorposts of olive wood but with four-sided doorposts.
11:6:34:He also made two juniper doors, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.
11:6:35:He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold, evenly applied on the carved work.
11:6:36:He built the inner courtyard with three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.
11:6:37:The foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.
11:6:38:In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month), the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. Solomon had spent seven years building it.
11:7:1:Solomon began constructing his own house, and it took him thirteen years to complete the entire project.
11:7:2:He also built a structure called the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon, which was 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. It had four rows of cedar pillars supporting cedar beams.
11:7:3:The hall's roof was made of cedar, and the forty-five pillars were arranged in fifteen groups of three.
11:7:4:There were windows on three levels, facing each other in perfect alignment.
11:7:5:All the doorways and window frames were square, and the windows faced each other on three different levels.
11:7:6:In addition, Solomon constructed the Hall of Pillars, which was 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide. There was a porch in front of this hall, supported by pillars.
11:7:7:He also built the Hall of Judgment, where he would judge cases. This hall was completely covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.
11:7:8:His personal living quarters, located within the same complex but separate from the hall where he judged, were constructed with the same level of craftsmanship. He also built similar living quarters for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.
11:7:9:All these structures were made of costly stones, cut according to specific measurements, sawed on both their inner and outer surfaces, from the foundation to the eaves, and outward to the great courtyard.
11:7:10:The foundation was laid with large, expensive stones, some measuring ten cubits and others eight cubits.
11:7:11:Above the foundation, costly stones were used, cut to size and finished with cedar beams.
11:7:12:The surrounding great courtyard had three layers of dressed stones and one layer of cedar beams, just like the inner courtyard of the Lord's temple and the hall of the temple.
11:7:13:King Solomon brought in a skilled craftsman named Hiram from Tyre.
11:7:14:Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a native of Tyre, who had been a skilled bronze worker. Hiram was highly skilled, knowledgeable, and talented in all sorts of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and completed all the bronze work needed for the temple.
11:7:15:He crafted two bronze pillars, each 18 cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference.
11:7:16:He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.
11:7:17:A network of interwoven chains decorated the capitals on top of the pillars, with seven chains for each capital.
11:7:18:He created two rows of pomegranates around each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for both capitals.
11:7:19:The capitals on top of the pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies, four cubits high.
11:7:20:The capitals on the two pillars had pomegranates above and close to the rounded surface next to the network. There were 200 pomegranates arranged in rows around each capital.
11:7:21:Hiram set up the pillars at the entrance of the temple's porch; he named the pillar on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.
11:7:22:The tops of the pillars were adorned with a lily design. Thus, the work on the pillars was completed.
11:7:23:He also made the Sea of cast metal, which was circular in shape, 10 cubits from rim to rim, five cubits high, and 30 cubits in circumference.
11:7:24:Under its rim, there were gourds encircling it, ten per cubit for a total of 300 gourds. They were cast in two rows when the Sea was cast.
11:7:25:The Sea rested on twelve oxen, with three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea was set on top of them, and their hindquarters faced inward.
11:7:26:The Sea's thickness was a handbreadth, and its rim was crafted like the edge of a cup, shaped like a lily blossom. It could hold 2,000 baths.
11:7:27:Hiram made ten bronze stands as well, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
11:7:28:These stands had side panels attached to uprights.
11:7:29:On the side panels between the uprights, there were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the uprights above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.
11:7:30:Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports. The supports were cast with wreaths on each side.
11:7:31:The opening at the top of each stand was a cubit high, and its opening was round, shaped like a pedestal, a cubit and a half in diameter. At the opening, there were carvings, with the panels being square, not round.
11:7:32:The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. Each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter.
11:7:33:The wheels were designed like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all made of cast metal.
11:7:34:There were four supports at each of the four corners of each stand, which were part of the stand itself.
11:7:35:At the top of the stand, there was a circular band half a cubit high, with supports and panels that were part of the stand.
11:7:36:Hiram engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever there was space for them, and he added wreaths all around.
11:7:37:He made ten stands in this way, all sharing the same design, size, and shape.
11:7:38:He also crafted ten bronze basins, each able to hold 40 baths and measuring four cubits in diameter. One basin was placed on each of the ten stands.
11:7:39:He positioned five stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He placed the Sea on the southeast corner of the temple.
11:7:40:Hiram also made basins, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. So Hiram completed all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the Lord's temple.
11:7:41:The two pillars, the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars, the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars,
11:7:42:the 400 pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars),
11:7:43:the ten stands with their ten basins,
11:7:44:the Sea, and the twelve oxen supporting it,
11:7:45:as well as the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. All these articles that Hiram made for King Solomon for the Lord's temple were made of burnished bronze.
11:7:46:The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
11:7:47:Solomon left all these items unweighed because there were so many; the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
11:7:48:Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Lord's temple: the golden altar, the golden table on which the bread of the Presence was placed,
11:7:49:the lampstands of pure gold (five on the south side and five on the north) in front of the inner sanctuary, the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold,
11:7:50:the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes, and firepans of pure gold, as well as the hinges of gold for the doors of the inner sanctuary (the Most Holy Place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
11:7:51:When all the work King Solomon had done for the Lord's temple was completed, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver, gold, and other articles—and placed them in the treasuries of the Lord's temple.
11:8:1:At that time, Solomon gathered the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, along with the leaders of the ancestral families of the Israelites, to come to Jerusalem. They were to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.
11:8:2:All the men of Israel came together before King Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
11:8:3:When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests picked up the Ark.
11:8:4:They brought the Ark of the Lord, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites carried them up.
11:8:5:King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who had assembled before him were with him in front of the Ark, sacrificing countless sheep and oxen.
11:8:6:The priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
11:8:7:For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark, covering the Ark and its carrying poles.
11:8:8:These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside. And they are still there today.
11:8:9:There was nothing inside the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
11:8:10:When the priests left the Holy Place, a cloud filled the temple of the Lord.
11:8:11:Because of the cloud, the priests couldn't continue their service, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
11:8:12:Then Solomon said, "The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud.
11:8:13:I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to live in forever."
11:8:14:Turning around, the king faced the entire assembly of Israel and blessed them.
11:8:15:He said, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said,
11:8:16:'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel to build a house so that my Name might be there. But I have chosen David to rule over my people Israel.'
11:8:17:My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11:8:18:But the Lord said to my father David, 'You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name.
11:8:19:Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'
11:8:20:The Lord has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
11:8:21:I have provided a place there for the Ark, which contains the covenant the Lord made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt."
11:8:22:Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven,
11:8:23:and said, "Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below—you who keep your covenant and show unfailing love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart.
11:8:24:You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today.
11:8:25:Now Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me faithfully as you have done.'
11:8:26:And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.
11:8:27:But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
11:8:28:Yet, Lord my God, give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence today.
11:8:29:May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, 'My Name shall be there,' so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
11:8:30:Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
11:8:31:When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple,
11:8:32:then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
11:8:33:When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and give praise to your Name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple,
11:8:34:then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
11:8:35:When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your Name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,
11:8:36:then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
11:8:37:When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
11:8:38:and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel—being aware of the afflictions of their own hearts, and spreading out their hands toward this temple—
11:8:39:then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know every human heart),
11:8:40:so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors.
11:8:41:As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your Name—
11:8:42:for they will hear of your great Name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple,
11:8:43:then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your Name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
11:8:44:When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the Lord toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,
11:8:45:then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
11:8:46:When they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them and give them over to their enemies, who take them captive to their own lands, far away or near;
11:8:47:and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly';
11:8:48:and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name;
11:8:49:then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
11:8:50:And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their captors to show them mercy;
11:8:51:for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.
11:8:52:May your eyes be open to your servant's plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you.
11:8:53:For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, Sovereign Lord, brought our ancestors out of Egypt."
11:8:54:When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
11:8:55:He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying,
11:8:56:"Praise be to the Lord, who has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses.
11:8:57:May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our ancestors; may he never leave us nor forsake us.
11:8:58:May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in obedience to him and keep the commands, decrees, and laws he gave our ancestors.
11:8:59:And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need,
11:8:60:so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God and that there is no other.
11:8:61:And may your hearts be fully committed to the Lord our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time."
11:8:62:Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord.
11:8:63:Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the Lord: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the Lord.
11:8:64:On that same day, the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar that stood before the Lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.
11:8:65:So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the Lord our God for seven days and seven more days—fourteen days in all.
11:8:66:On the following day, he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel.
11:9:1:After Solomon finished building the Lord's temple, his own palace, and all that he desired and planned to construct,
11:9:2:the Lord appeared to him a second time, just as He had done at Gibeon.
11:9:3:And the Lord said to Solomon, "I have heard your prayer and supplication that you have made before Me. I have consecrated this temple you built by putting My Name there forever. My eyes and My heart will always be there.
11:9:4:As for you, if you walk before Me with integrity, as your father David did, and do everything I commanded, obeying My laws and regulations,
11:9:5:then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised your father David when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.'
11:9:6:But if you or your descendants turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and statutes which I have set before you, and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
11:9:7:then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them, and this temple that I have consecrated for My Name, I will cast out of My sight. Israel will become a proverb and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
11:9:8:This temple will become a heap of ruins. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, saying, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'
11:9:9:People will answer, 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them. That is why the Lord brought all this disaster upon them.'"
11:9:10:At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the Lord and the royal palace—
11:9:11:King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted.
11:9:12:But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
11:9:13:"What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, a name they have to this day.
11:9:14:Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
11:9:15:This is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the Lord's temple, his own palace, the terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
11:9:16:(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.)
11:9:17:So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth Horon,
11:9:18:Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, within his land,
11:9:19:as well as all his store cities, the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout all the territory he ruled.
11:9:20:All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites—
11:9:21:their descendants who were still left in the land, whom the Israelites could not completely destroy—Solomon conscripted for his forced labor, as it is to this day.
11:9:22:But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and horsemen.
11:9:23:These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: 550 officials supervising the men who did the work.
11:9:24:After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces.
11:9:25:Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord, burning incense before the Lord along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.
11:9:26:King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
11:9:27:And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.
11:9:28:They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
11:10:1:When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame and his relationship with the Lord, she came to test him with difficult questions.
11:10:2:Arriving in Jerusalem with a large group, camels carrying spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones, she met with Solomon and discussed everything on her mind.
11:10:3:Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing too difficult for the king to explain.
11:10:4:When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,
11:10:5:the food at his table, the seating arrangement of his officials, the service and attire of his attendants, and his burnt offerings at the temple, she was left breathless.
11:10:6:She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom is true.
11:10:7:But I did not believe these things until I came and saw them with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me; your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report I heard.
11:10:8:How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom!
11:10:9:Praise be to the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord's eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness."
11:10:10:Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
11:10:11:Hiram's fleet brought gold from Ophir, along with almug wood and precious stones.
11:10:12:The king used the almug wood to make supports for the temple and his palace, as well as harps and lyres for the musicians. No such almug wood has come or been seen since that day.
11:10:13:King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, in addition to what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she and her attendants returned to her own country.
11:10:14:Each year, Solomon collected 666 talents of gold,
11:10:15:not including the revenue from merchants and traders, and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the land.
11:10:16:King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
11:10:17:He also made 300 small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
11:10:18:Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
11:10:19:The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.
11:10:20:Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
11:10:21:All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were gold, and all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, as it was considered of little value in Solomon's time.
11:10:22:For the king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years, the fleet would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
11:10:23:Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
11:10:24:The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
11:10:25:Year after year, everyone who visited brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
11:10:26:Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
11:10:27:The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
11:10:28:Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price.
11:10:29:A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They then exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the Arameans.
11:11:1:Now, King Solomon loved many foreign women, in addition to Pharaoh's daughter; Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women.
11:11:2:These women came from nations the Lord had warned Israel about, saying, "Do not intermarry with them, for they will surely turn your hearts toward their gods." But Solomon was deeply attached to them.
11:11:3:He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines, and his wives led him astray.
11:11:4:As Solomon grew older, his wives turned his heart toward other gods, and he was no longer fully devoted to the Lord his God, as his father David had been.
11:11:5:Solomon followed Astarte, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11:11:6:In this way, Solomon did what was evil in the Lord's sight and did not follow the Lord completely like his father David.
11:11:7:Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, on a hill east of Jerusalem, and for Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.
11:11:8:He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
11:11:9:The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
11:11:10:God had commanded Solomon not to follow other gods, but he did not keep the Lord's command.
11:11:11:So the Lord said to Solomon, "Since you have chosen to disobey my commands and have not kept my covenant and statutes, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
11:11:12:However, for the sake of your father David, I will not do this during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
11:11:13:Yet, I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
11:11:14:Then the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, a member of the royal family in Edom.
11:11:15:Earlier, when David had conquered Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who went to bury the dead, killed all the males in Edom.
11:11:16:Joab and all Israel remained there for six months, until they had eliminated every male in Edom.
11:11:17:But Hadad, along with some Edomite officials, escaped to Egypt. He was just a young boy at the time.
11:11:18:They set out from Midian and arrived in Paran. They took men with them from Paran and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, land, and provided him with food.
11:11:19:Pharaoh grew fond of Hadad, so he gave him his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as a wife.
11:11:20:The sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. Genubath lived there among Pharaoh's own children.
11:11:21:When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had died and that Joab, the commander of the army, was also dead, he said to Pharaoh, "Let me return to my own country."
11:11:22:Pharaoh asked him, "What have you lacked here with me that you now want to go back to your own country?" Hadad replied, "Nothing, but please let me leave."
11:11:23:God also raised up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.
11:11:24:Rezon gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David killed the people of Zobah. They went to Damascus, settled there, and made Rezon their ruler in Damascus.
11:11:25:Rezon was an adversary of Israel all during Solomon's reign, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. He ruled over Aram and despised Israel.
11:11:26:Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah and a servant of Solomon, also rebelled against the king. His mother's name was Zeruah, a widow.
11:11:27:The reason Jeroboam rebelled against the king was that Solomon had built the terraces and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
11:11:28:Jeroboam was a man of great ability, and when Solomon saw how industrious he was, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph.
11:11:29:One day, as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him on the road, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone in the countryside.
11:11:30:Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
11:11:31:Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.
11:11:32:But I will leave one tribe for him, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
11:11:33:I will do this because Solomon has abandoned me and worshiped Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Molech the god of the Ammonites. He has not followed my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes and laws like his father David did.
11:11:34:However, I will not take the whole kingdom away from him; I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and statutes.
11:11:35:But I will take the kingdom from his son's hand and give you ten tribes.
11:11:36:I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.
11:11:37:As for you, I will make you king over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.
11:11:38:If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me, following my ways and doing what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
11:11:39:I will humble David's descendants because of this, but not forever.'"
11:11:40:Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon's death.
11:11:41:As for the other events of Solomon's reign, all he did and the wisdom he displayed, are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?
11:11:42:Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
11:11:43:Then Solomon rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
11:12:1:Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king.
11:12:2:When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon.
11:12:3:The people of Israel sent for Jeroboam, and they assembled together. They approached Rehoboam and said,
11:12:4:"Your father made our yoke heavy. Now, lighten the hard labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
11:12:5:Rehoboam replied, "Go away for three days, then come back to me." So the people left.
11:12:6:King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, "How do you advise me to respond to these people?"
11:12:7:They answered, "If you are kind to these people and please them by speaking good words, they will be your servants forever."
11:12:8:But Rehoboam ignored the advice of the elders and instead sought counsel from the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisors.
11:12:9:He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who want me to lighten the burden my father placed on them?"
11:12:10:The young men replied, "Tell the people who asked you to lighten their yoke, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.'
11:12:11:My father laid a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
11:12:12:Three days later, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had instructed them.
11:12:13:The king answered the people harshly, disregarding the advice of the elders.
11:12:14:He followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
11:12:15:So the king did not listen to the people, fulfilling the prophecy that the Lord had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
11:12:16:When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, David!" So the Israelites went home.
11:12:17:However, Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
11:12:18:King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
11:12:19:From that time on, Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David until this day.
11:12:20:When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
11:12:21:Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem and mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men—to wage war against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
11:12:22:But God spoke to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
11:12:23:"Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people,
11:12:24:'This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, for what has happened is my doing.'" They obeyed the word of the Lord and went home, as the Lord had commanded.
11:13:1:A man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as the Lord had instructed him. Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense.
11:13:2:The man of God cried out against the altar, in line with the Lord's command, and said, "Altar, altar! The Lord says this: A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones will be burned on you."
11:13:3:That day, he gave a sign, saying, "This is the sign the Lord has declared: The altar will be split apart, and the ashes on it will be poured out."
11:13:4:When King Jeroboam heard the message the man of God proclaimed against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But his hand that he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, and he couldn't pull it back.
11:13:5:Moreover, the altar was split apart, and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God through the word of the Lord.
11:13:6:Then the king pleaded with the man of God, "Please pray to the Lord your God and ask him to restore my hand." So the man of God prayed to the Lord, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before.
11:13:7:Afterward, the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift."
11:13:8:But the man of God replied, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
11:13:9:For this is what I was commanded by the word of the Lord: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'"
11:13:10:So he took a different route and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
11:13:11:Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel, and his sons came and told him everything the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father what he had said to the king.
11:13:12:Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken.
11:13:13:So he told his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." When they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it
11:13:14:and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he replied.
11:13:15:Then the prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat."
11:13:16:The man of God answered, "I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
11:13:17:I have been told by the word of the Lord: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'"
11:13:18:The old prophet then said, "I too am a prophet, like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he was lying to him.
11:13:19:So the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.
11:13:20:While they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
11:13:21:He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the Lord says: 'You have defied the word of the Lord and have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you.
11:13:22:You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore, your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.'"
11:13:23:After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.
11:13:24:As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it
11:13:25:Some people who passed by saw the body lying there, with the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
11:13:26:When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard about it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the Lord. The Lord has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the Lord had warned him."
11:13:27:Then the prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so.
11:13:28:He went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.
11:13:29:So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
11:13:30:He laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, saying, "Oh, my brother!"
11:13:31:After burying him, the prophet said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the same grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
11:13:32:For the message he declared by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."
11:13:33:Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.
11:13:34:This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
11:14:1:At that time, Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick.
11:14:2:Jeroboam's wife said to him, "Please disguise yourself so no one recognizes you as the king's wife, and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there; he told me that you would become king over this people.
11:14:3:Take ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey with you, and visit him. He will tell you what will happen to our son."
11:14:4:So Jeroboam's wife did as she was instructed. She disguised herself and went to Shiloh, arriving at Ahijah's house.
11:14:5:Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. But the Lord had told him, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, who is sick. When she arrives, she will be in disguise. This is what you must say to her."
11:14:6:When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you disguised? I have been sent to give you bad news.
11:14:7:Go tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I raised you up from among the people and made you ruler over my people Israel.
11:14:8:I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.
11:14:9:You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have made other gods and cast images to provoke me to anger, and you have turned your back on me.
11:14:10:Because of this, I will bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both slave and free in Israel, and I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung until it is all gone.
11:14:11:Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and birds will feed on those who die in the country. The Lord has spoken.'
11:14:12:As for you, go back home. When your feet touch the city, the boy will die.
11:14:13:All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one from Jeroboam's family who will be laid to rest, because he is the only one in whom the Lord, the God of Israel, has found anything good.
11:14:14:The Lord will raise up a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even now.
11:14:15:For the Lord will strike Israel, making it like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River because they aroused the Lord's anger by making Asherah poles.
11:14:16:He will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit."
11:14:17:Jeroboam's wife left and went back to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of her house, the boy died.
11:14:18:They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the Lord had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
11:14:19:The other events of Jeroboam's reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
11:14:20:Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his ancestors. His son Nadab succeeded him as king.
11:14:21:Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his Name there. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
11:14:22:Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord. By the sins they committed, they stirred up his jealous anger more than their ancestors had done.
11:14:23:They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
11:14:24:There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
11:14:25:In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
11:14:26:He took away the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the royal palace; he took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
11:14:27:So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
11:14:28:Whenever the king went to the Lord's temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
11:14:29:As for the other events of Rehoboam's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
11:14:30:There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
11:14:31:Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And his son Abijah succeeded him as king.
11:15:1:In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Abijam became king of Judah.
11:15:2:He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom.
11:15:3:Abijam followed in the sinful footsteps of his father, and his heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of his grandfather David had been.
11:15:4:Nevertheless, for David's sake, the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.
11:15:5:Because David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not turned aside from anything he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
11:15:6:There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout Abijam's lifetime.
11:15:7:The rest of the events of Abijam's reign, and all that he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
11:15:8:When Abijam passed away, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Asa succeeded him as king.
11:15:9:In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Asa became king of Judah.
11:15:10:Asa ruled in Jerusalem for forty-one years. His grandmother's name was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom.
11:15:11:Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just like his ancestor David.
11:15:12:He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols his ancestors had made.
11:15:13:He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
11:15:14:Although the high places were not removed, Asa's heart was fully committed to the Lord all his life.
11:15:15:He brought into the temple of the Lord the silver, gold, and articles that he and his father had dedicated.
11:15:16:There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
11:15:17:Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
11:15:18:Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Lord's temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, grandson of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.
11:15:19:"Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."
11:15:20:Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maakah, and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
11:15:21:When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
11:15:22:Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them, King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.
11:15:23:The other events of Asa's reign, all his achievements, all he did, and the cities he built are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. In his old age, however, his feet became diseased.
11:15:24:Finally, Asa passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king.
11:16:1:Ahab, son of Omri, became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa's reign as Judah's king. He ruled for twenty-two years in Samaria.
11:16:2:He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even more than all who came before him.
11:16:3:As if it wasn't enough to follow the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, Ahab married Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, and began to worship Baal.
11:16:4:In Samaria, he built a temple and an altar for Baal,
11:16:5:and also set up an Asherah pole. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than any of the kings of Israel before him.
11:16:6:During his time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. It cost him the life of his firstborn, Abiram, when he laid its foundations, and the life of his youngest son, Segub, when he set up its gates. This fulfilled the word of the Lord spoken by Joshua, son of Nun.
11:16:7:Then the Lord spoke to Jehu, son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying,
11:16:8:"Since I lifted you up from the dust and made you ruler over my people Israel, yet you have followed the path of Jeroboam and caused my people to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
11:16:9:I will destroy both you and your family, just as I did to Jeroboam, son of Nebat.
11:16:10:Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the countryside will be eaten by birds."
11:16:11:As for the other events of Baasha's reign, his accomplishments, and everything he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11:16:12:Baasha rested with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah succeeded him as king.
11:16:13:Because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah committed and caused Israel to commit, they provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
11:16:14:In the twenty-sixth year of Asa's reign as Judah's king, Elah, son of Baasha, became king of Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for two years.
11:16:15:His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, plotted against him. While Elah was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk at the house of Arza, who was in charge of the palace, 
11:16:16:Zimri entered, struck him down, and killed him. He succeeded Elah as king in the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign as Judah's king.
11:16:17:When Zimri became king, he killed off Baasha's entire family, sparing no male relatives or friends.
11:16:18:So Zimri destroyed the entire house of Baasha, fulfilling the word of the Lord spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu.
11:16:19:Because of the sins committed by Baasha and his son Elah, and because they led Israel into sin, they provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
11:16:20:The other events of Elah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11:16:21:Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half supported Tibni, son of Ginath, to make him king, while the other half supported Omri.
11:16:22:But Omri's followers proved stronger than those of Tibni, son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king.
11:16:23:In the thirty-first year of Asa's reign as Judah's king, Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled for twelve years. He reigned in Tirzah for six years.
11:16:24:He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, built a city on the hill, and named it Samaria, after Shemer, the owner of the hill.
11:16:25:Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all who were before him.
11:16:26:He followed the ways of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and caused Israel to commit sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
11:16:27:As for the other events of Omri's reign, his accomplishments, and everything he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11:16:28:Omri rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. His son Ahab succeeded him as king.
11:16:29:In the thirty-eighth year of Asa's reign as Judah's king, Ahab, son of Omri, became king over Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twenty-two years.
11:16:30:Ahab, son of Omri, did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him.
11:16:31:He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him.
11:16:32:He built a temple for Baal in Samaria, and made an altar for Baal.
11:16:33:Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
11:16:34:During Ahab's time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken through Joshua, son of Nun.
11:17:1:At this time, the prophet Elijah from Tishbe in Gilead said to Ahab, "As the LORD God of Israel lives, whom I serve, there will be no dew or rain during these years, except by my command."
11:17:2:Then the LORD instructed Elijah, saying,
11:17:3:"Leave this place and head eastward. Hide yourself near the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
11:17:4:You can drink from the brook, and I have commanded ravens to provide food for you there."
11:17:5:So Elijah did as the LORD told him, and he went to live by the brook Cherith, east of the Jordan.
11:17:6:The ravens brought him bread and meat every morning and evening, and he drank from the brook.
11:17:7:But after some time, the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.
11:17:8:Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah:
11:17:9:"Go now to Zarephath, a village in Sidon, and stay there. I have instructed a widow there to provide for you."
11:17:10:Elijah went to Zarephath and, upon arriving at the town gate, he saw a widow gathering sticks. He called out to her and asked, "Please bring me a little water in a jar so I may drink."
11:17:11:As she was going to fetch it, he called again, "And please bring me a piece of bread as well."
11:17:12:She replied, "As the LORD your God lives, I don't have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I'm gathering a few sticks to take home and prepare a final meal for myself and my son, so that we may eat it and die."
11:17:13:Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you've said. But first, make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me. Then make something for yourself and your son.
11:17:14:For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the land.'"
11:17:15:She went and did as Elijah told her, and they had food every day for Elijah, the woman, and her family.
11:17:16:The jar of flour was never empty, and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.
11:17:17:Some time later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. His illness grew worse, and he stopped breathing.
11:17:18:The woman said to Elijah, "What have you done to me, man of God? Have you come to remind me of my sin and cause my son's death?"
11:17:19:"Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took the boy from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
11:17:20:Then he cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?"
11:17:21:He stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!"
11:17:22:The LORD heard Elijah's prayer, and the life of the boy returned to him, and he lived.
11:17:23:Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!"
11:17:24:Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."
11:18:1:Now it happened after a long time that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth."
11:18:2:So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.
11:18:3:Ahab called Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord.
11:18:4:When Jezebel was killing off the Lord's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had provided them with food and water.
11:18:5:Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we don't have to kill any of our animals."
11:18:6:They divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going one way and Obadiah another.
11:18:7:As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?"
11:18:8:Elijah answered, "Yes, it is I. Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"
11:18:9:Obadiah replied, "How have I sinned, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be killed?
11:18:10:As surely as the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.
11:18:11:But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'
11:18:12:I don't know where the Spirit of the Lord may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I, your servant, have worshiped the Lord since my youth.
11:18:13:Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord? I hid a hundred of the Lord's prophets in two caves and supplied them with food and water.
11:18:14:And now you want me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!"
11:18:15:Elijah said, "As the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."
11:18:16:So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
11:18:17:When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, the one who brings trouble on Israel?"
11:18:18:Elijah replied, "I have not made trouble for Israel, but you and your family have. You have abandoned the Lord's commands and followed the Baals.
11:18:19:Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
11:18:20:So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
11:18:21:Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.
11:18:22:Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the Lord's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
11:18:23:Get two bulls for us. Let Baal's prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.
11:18:24:Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire—he is God." Then all the people agreed that this was a good idea.
11:18:25:Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire."
11:18:26:So they took the bull given them and prepared it. They called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, saying, "Baal, answer us!" But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
11:18:27:At noon Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened."
11:18:28:So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.
11:18:29:Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
11:18:30:Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down.
11:18:31:Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel."
11:18:32:With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
11:18:33:He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."
11:18:34:"Do it again," he said, and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time.
11:18:35:The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
11:18:36:At the time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet stepped forward and prayed, "Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
11:18:37:Answer me, Lord, answer me, so these people will know that you, Lord, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."
11:18:38:Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.
11:18:39:When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The Lord—he is God! The Lord—he is God!"
11:18:40:Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
11:18:41:And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."
11:18:42:So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground, and put his face between his knees.
11:18:43:"Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."
11:18:44:The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"
11:18:45:Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling, and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
11:18:46:The power of the Lord came on Elijah, and tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
11:19:1:After Ahab informed Jezebel of everything Elijah had done, including the killing of all the prophets with the sword, she sent a message to Elijah.
11:19:2:She threatened him, saying, "May the gods do the same to me and even more if I don't make your life like that of one of those prophets you killed by this time tomorrow."
11:19:3:Fearing for his life, Elijah ran away and came to Beersheba in Judah. He left his servant there,
11:19:4:and continued on into the wilderness for another day's journey. He sat down under a broom tree, feeling exhausted and hopeless, and asked God to take his life. "I've had enough, Lord," he said, "just let me die, for I am no better than my ancestors."
11:19:5:As he lay down and fell asleep under the tree, an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."
11:19:6:Elijah looked around and saw some bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water nearby. He ate and drank, then lay down again.
11:19:7:The angel of the Lord returned a second time, touching him and saying, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you."
11:19:8:So he got up, ate, and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
11:19:9:There, he went into a cave and spent the night. The word of the Lord came to him, asking, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11:19:10:Elijah replied, "I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts. The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are trying to take my life."
11:19:11:The Lord said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
11:19:12:After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was a gentle whisper.
11:19:13:When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak, went out, and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice asked him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11:19:14:He answered, "I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts. The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are trying to take my life."
11:19:15:The Lord said to him, "Go back the way you came, and head to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
11:19:16:Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah as prophet to succeed you.
11:19:17:Whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.
11:19:18:Yet, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him."
11:20:1:Around this time, Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, gathered his whole army and, supported by 32 other kings along with their horses and chariots, he marched to besiege Samaria, the capital of Israel.
11:20:2:He sent messengers to Ahab, the king of Israel, who was in the city.
11:20:3:They told Ahab, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: 'Your silver and gold are mine, and so are your best wives and children.'"
11:20:4:The king of Israel replied, "As you say, my lord the king, I and everything I have are yours."
11:20:5:The messengers returned to Ahab and said, "Ben-Hadad demands that you send him tomorrow all the valuables that your officials and people possess."
11:20:6:Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of Israel and explained the situation. He said, "This man is looking for trouble. He has already demanded my wives, children, silver, and gold, and now he wants everything else!"
11:20:7:The elders advised Ahab to refuse Ben-Hadad's demand.
11:20:8:Ahab agreed with them and sent a reply to Ben-Hadad: "Tell him that I will not comply with his latest demand."
11:20:9:When Ben-Hadad received the message, he was furious and threatened to destroy Samaria completely.
11:20:10:Then a prophet approached Ahab and said, "The Lord says, 'Do not be afraid of this vast army, for I will give you victory over them today. You will know that I am the Lord.'"
11:20:11:Ahab asked, "Who will lead us into battle?" The prophet answered, "The young officers of the provincial governors."
11:20:12:So Ahab assembled these officers, who numbered 232. He also gathered 7,000 soldiers from Israel.
11:20:13:They launched a surprise attack at noon when Ben-Hadad and his allied kings were getting drunk in their tents.
11:20:14:The Aramean army was defeated, and the rest fled to the city of Aphek. The wall of the city collapsed, killing 27,000 soldiers.
11:20:15:Ben-Hadad escaped and hid in an inner room with some of his officials.
11:20:16:His advisers suggested that they should surrender to Ahab because they had heard that the kings of Israel were merciful.
11:20:17:So they put on sackcloth and ropes around their heads and went to Ahab, begging for their lives.
11:20:18:Ahab decided to spare Ben-Hadad's life and made a treaty with him.
11:20:19:Later, a prophet told Ahab that he had made a grave mistake by sparing Ben-Hadad, and that he would suffer the consequences.
11:20:20:Ahab returned home to Samaria, angry and resentful.
11:21:1:Ahab, the king of Israel, had a palace in Jezreel. Next to it was a vineyard owned by Naboth.
11:21:2:One day, Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard so I can turn it into a vegetable garden, since it's right next to my palace. In exchange, I'll give you a better vineyard or pay you its value in silver."
11:21:3:Naboth replied, "No way! This land is my family's inheritance; I cannot give it up."
11:21:4:Ahab went back to his palace, angry and upset because of what Naboth had told him. He lay down on his bed, turned away from everyone, and refused to eat.
11:21:5:Jezebel, Ahab's wife, came to him and asked, "Why are you so upset? Why won't you eat?"
11:21:6:He answered, "I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or trade it for another one, but he said no."
11:21:7:Jezebel said, "Aren't you the king of Israel? Cheer up and eat! I'll get that vineyard for you."
11:21:8:So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city.
11:21:9:In the letters, she wrote, "Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly.
11:21:10:Then bring two scoundrels to accuse him of cursing God and the king. After that, take him out and stone him to death."
11:21:11:The city leaders did as Jezebel instructed in the letters she sent them.
11:21:12:They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly.
11:21:13:The two scoundrels came in, sat opposite Naboth, and accused him of cursing God and the king. Then they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
11:21:14:When they had finished, they sent word to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
11:21:15:Upon hearing the news, Jezebel told Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard that Naboth refused to sell you. He's dead now."
11:21:16:Ahab went down to Naboth's vineyard to claim it as his own.
11:21:17:But the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
11:21:18:"Go meet Ahab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria. You'll find him in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.
11:21:19:Tell him that I, the Lord, say, 'Have you killed and taken possession? In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will also lick up your blood.'"
11:21:20:Elijah went to confront Ahab. When Ahab saw him, he said, "So you've found me, my enemy." Elijah replied, "Yes, I've found you because you've sold yourself to do evil in the Lord's eyes.
11:21:21:Because of this, I will bring disaster upon you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off every male in Israel, both slave and free.
11:21:22:I will make your family like the families of Jeroboam and Baasha, because you have provoked me to anger and led Israel into sin."
11:21:23:The Lord also said, "As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her body in the territory of Jezreel.
11:21:24:Any of your family members who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the countryside will be eaten by birds."
11:21:25:No one was more devoted to doing evil in the eyes of the Lord than Ahab, urged on by his wife Jezebel.
11:21:26:He committed many detestable acts, following idols just like the Amorites whom the Lord had driven out before Israel.
11:21:27:When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and walked around humbly.
11:21:28:The Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has done so, I will not bring disaster during his lifetime. It will come upon his family in his son's days."
11:22:1:In the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, visited Ahab, the king of Israel.
11:22:2:Ahab asked his officials, "Why haven't we taken back Ramoth-gilead from the king of Aram, even though it belongs to us?"
11:22:3:Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and said, "Will you join me in battle at Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you; my soldiers and horses are at your disposal."
11:22:4:But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First, let's seek the Lord's guidance."
11:22:5:So the king of Israel gathered about four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?" They answered, "Go ahead, for the Lord will give it into your hands."
11:22:6:However, Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there another prophet of the Lord here whom we can consult?"
11:22:7:The king of Israel replied, "There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad." Jehoshaphat said, "Don't say that, please."
11:22:8:So the king of Israel called an officer and ordered him to bring Micaiah quickly.
11:22:9:While they were waiting, the kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the entrance of Samaria's city gate, surrounded by all the prophets who were prophesying.
11:22:10:One of the prophets, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made iron horns and declared, "This is what the Lord says: With these horns, you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed."
11:22:11:All the other prophets agreed, saying, "Attack Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the Lord will give it into your hands."
11:22:12:The messenger who went to get Micaiah told him, "The prophets have unanimously predicted success for the king. Please agree with them and say the same thing."
11:22:13:Micaiah replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, I can only say what He tells me to say."
11:22:14:When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?" Micaiah answered sarcastically, "Go ahead and be victorious, for the Lord will give it into your hands."
11:22:15:The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
11:22:16:So Micaiah said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These people have no master; let each one return home in peace.'"
11:22:17:The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad?"
11:22:18:Micaiah continued, "Hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.
11:22:19:And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth-gilead and going to his death there?' One suggested this, and another that.
11:22:20:Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.' 'How?' the Lord asked.
11:22:21:'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'
11:22:22:So now the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you."
11:22:23:Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah on the face. "Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.
11:22:24:Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."
11:22:25:The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the city governor and to Joash the king's son.
11:22:26:Tell them, 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and give him only bread and water until I return safely.'"
11:22:27:Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Listen, all you people!"
11:22:28:So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
11:22:29:The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
11:22:30:The king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
11:22:31:When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
11:22:32:When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
11:22:33:But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."
11:22:34:All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
11:22:35:As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town; every man to his land!"
11:22:36:So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where they buried him.
11:22:37:They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared.
11:22:38:As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
11:22:39:Ahab rested with his ancestors, and Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
11:22:40:Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
11:22:41:Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
11:22:42:He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. However, the high places were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
11:22:43:Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.
11:22:44:As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
11:22:45:He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.
11:22:46:There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled.
11:22:47:Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold. But they never set sail—they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
11:22:48:At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with yours," but Jehoshaphat refused.
11:22:49:And Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
11:22:50:Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
11:22:51:He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
11:22:52:He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, just as his father had done.
