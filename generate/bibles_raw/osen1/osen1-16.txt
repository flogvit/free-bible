16:1:1:In the month of Kislev, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, I, Nehemiah, was in the fortress city of Susa.
16:1:2:Hearing about my fellow Jews who had survived the exile and were back in Jerusalem, I asked Hanani, one of my brothers, along with some other men from Judah, about their situation.
16:1:3:They told me, "The survivors are struggling. They're in great distress and shame because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned."
16:1:4:Upon hearing this news, I sat down and wept. For days, I mourned, fasted, and prayed to the God of heaven.
16:1:5:I said, "Lord, the God of heaven, you are great and awe-inspiring. You keep your covenant of love with those who love you and obey your commandments.
16:1:6:Please hear my prayer and listen to the words of your servant. I am praying to you day and night for your people Israel, confessing our sins that we've committed against you. Both my family and I have sinned.
16:1:7:We have acted terribly toward you, not obeying the commands, decrees, and laws you gave your servant Moses.
16:1:8:But remember what you told Moses: 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations.
16:1:9:However, if you return to me and obey my commands, even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'
16:1:10:These are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and mighty hand.
16:1:11:Lord, please pay attention to my prayer and the prayers of all your people who desire to honor your Name. Grant me success today by making the king favorable to me." I was the king's cupbearer at that time.
16:2:1:In the month of Nisan, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, I, Nehemiah, was serving wine to the king. As I poured the wine, I had never before appeared sad in his presence.
16:2:2:Noticing my sadness, the king asked, "Why do you look so troubled? You're not ill; this must be a matter of the heart." Overwhelmed with fear,
16:2:3:I replied, "May the king live forever! My face is downcast because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire."
16:2:4:The king then asked, "What is it that you want?" I prayed to the God of heaven
16:2:5:and answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in your sight, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors' graves, so I can rebuild it."
16:2:6:With the queen sitting beside him, the king asked, "How long will your journey take, and when will you return?" Pleased with my request, he granted it and set a date for my return.
16:2:7:I also asked the king, "If it pleases you, provide me with letters to the governors of the region beyond the Euphrates River, so they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.
16:2:8:And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, instructing him to supply me with timber for the gates of the citadel near the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I will occupy." The king granted my requests because God's gracious hand was upon me.
16:2:9:I traveled to the governors of the region beyond the Euphrates River and presented the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me for protection.
16:2:10:When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about my arrival, they were greatly disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
16:2:11:After arriving in Jerusalem, I rested for three days.
16:2:12:During the night, I set out with a few men, not telling anyone what God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the one I was riding.
16:2:13:Under the cover of darkness, I rode out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the broken walls of Jerusalem and its burned gates.
16:2:14:I then moved on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there wasn't enough room for my mount to pass.
16:2:15:So I went up by the Kidron Valley at night, inspecting the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
16:2:16:The city officials were unaware of where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet revealed my plans to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or anyone else involved in the work.
16:2:17:Then I said to them, "You can see the trouble we're in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned. Let's rebuild the city wall so we are no longer an object of ridicule."
16:2:18:I told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They responded, "Let's start rebuilding!" And they eagerly began the work.
16:2:19:But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plan, they mocked us and said, "What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"
16:2:20:I answered them, "The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start rebuilding. But you have no share, no claim, or historic right in Jerusalem."
16:3:1:Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began rebuilding the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it, set up its doors, and extended the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.
16:3:2:Next to Eliashib, the men of Jericho worked on the wall, and beside them, Zaccur son of Imri carried out repairs.
16:3:3:The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah; they laid its beams, installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16:3:4:Mereumoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, made repairs next to them. Beside him, Meshullam son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel, worked on the wall. And next to him, Zadok son of Baana carried out repairs.
16:3:5:The Tekoites made repairs nearby, but their nobles did not support the work of their supervisors.
16:3:6:Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate. They laid its beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16:3:7:Beside them, Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah worked on the wall, extending it to the seat of the governor of the region beyond the River.
16:3:8:Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith, carried out repairs next to them. Hananiah, a perfume maker, worked beside him, restoring Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16:3:9:Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs next to them.
16:3:10:Adjacent to him, Jedaiah son of Harumaph repaired the wall opposite his house. Hattush son of Hashabneiah worked next to him.
16:3:11:Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.
16:3:12:Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, carried out repairs with the help of his daughters.
16:3:13:The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it, installed its doors, bolts, and bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
16:3:14:Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired the Dung Gate. He rebuilt it and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16:3:15:The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Col-hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofed it, installed its doors, bolts, and bars, and also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king's garden, extending it as far as the stairs that descend from the City of David.
16:3:16:Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Heroes.
16:3:17:Next to him, the Levites under Rehum son of Bani carried out repairs. Beside them, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, worked on the wall for his district.
16:3:18:After him, the repairs were carried out by their fellow Levites under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half district of Keilah.
16:3:19:Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle.
16:3:20:Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the Angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16:3:21:Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the entrance of Eliashib's house to the end of his house.
16:3:22:Next to him, the priests from the surrounding area carried out repairs.
16:3:23:Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. Beside them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, worked on the wall near his house.
16:3:24:Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah's house to the Angle and the corner.
16:3:25:Palal son of Uzai worked on the wall opposite the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Beside him, Pedaiah son of Parosh carried out repairs.
16:3:26:The temple servants living on Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
16:3:27:Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.
16:3:28:Above the Horse Gate, the priests carried out repairs, each one opposite his own house.
16:3:29:Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Beside him, Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, worked on the wall.
16:3:30:Hanan son of Zalaph and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.
16:3:31:Malkijah, a goldsmith, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the upper room at the corner.
16:3:32:The goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate.
16:4:1:When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly annoyed. He mocked the Jews,
16:4:2:saying in front of his associates and the army of Samaria, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore the wall by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish this in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble, even those that have been burned?"
16:4:3:Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, added, "Even if a fox climbed on top of what they're building, it would break down their wall of stones!"
16:4:4:Upon hearing their taunts, I prayed, "Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.
16:4:5:Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders."
16:4:6:So we continued to build the wall, and all of it was joined together up to half its height, because the people had a mind to work.
16:4:7:But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls were going ahead and the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.
16:4:8:They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and cause confusion in it.
16:4:9:However, we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
16:4:10:Meanwhile, the people of Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."
16:4:11:Also, our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right among them and kill them and put an end to their work."
16:4:12:When the Jews who lived near our enemies came, they told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."
16:4:13:Therefore, I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
16:4:14:Afterward, I looked things over and stood up, saying to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."
16:4:15:When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work.
16:4:16:From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah
16:4:17:who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,
16:4:18:and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
16:4:19:Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.
16:4:20:Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!"
16:4:21:So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn until the stars came out.
16:4:22:At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day."
16:4:23:Neither I nor my brothers, nor my men, nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
16:5:1:In that time, the people and their families raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews.
16:5:2:Some were saying, "We have to mortgage our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine."
16:5:3:Others said, "We've borrowed money to pay the king's taxes on our fields and vineyards.
16:5:4:Even though we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and our children are like theirs, we must subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless because our fields and vineyards belong to others."
16:5:5:When I heard their outcry and these complaints, I became very angry.
16:5:6:After thinking it over, I confronted the nobles and officials, telling them, "You are charging your own people interest!" Then I called together a large assembly to deal with them.
16:5:7:I said to them, "As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.
16:5:8:So I continued, "What you're doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?
16:5:9:I and my brothers, as well as my men, have also lent the people money and grain. But let's stop charging interest!
16:5:10:Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil."
16:5:11:They replied, "We will give it back and not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials swear to do what they had promised.
16:5:12:I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may they be shaken out and emptied!" All the assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
16:5:13:Moreover, from the time I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
16:5:14:But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God, I did not act like that.
16:5:15:Instead, I devoted myself to the work on the wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
16:5:16:Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.
16:5:17:Each day one ox, six choice sheep, and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds was provided. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.
16:5:18:Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
16:6:1:Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and there were no gaps left (although at that time I hadn't set up the doors in the gates),
16:6:2:Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, "Come, let's meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they planned to harm me.
16:6:3:So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing an important work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?"
16:6:4:They sent this message to me four times, and I answered them in the same way each time.
16:6:5:Then Sanballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand, the fifth time, with the same message.
16:6:6:The letter read, "It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu confirms it, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; that's why you're building the wall. According to these reports, you intend to become their king.
16:6:7:You have also appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Jerusalem, 'There is a king in Judah!' Now these reports will reach the king. So come, let's discuss this matter together."
16:6:8:I sent back a reply, saying, "What you are saying is not true. You are making up these stories in your own imagination."
16:6:9:For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will be weakened from the work, and it won't be completed." But now, O God, strengthen my hands!
16:6:10:One day, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home. He said, "Let's meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and close the temple doors, for they are coming to kill you; they will come to kill you at night."
16:6:11:But I replied, "Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I won't do it!"
16:6:12:I realized that God had not sent him, but he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16:6:13:They hired him to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and they could give me a bad reputation to discredit me.
16:6:14:My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who tried to frighten me.
16:6:15:The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16:6:16:When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their confidence, for they realized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
16:6:17:In those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.
16:6:18:For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
16:6:19:They kept telling me about Tobiah's good deeds, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16:7:1:Now it came to pass, when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, that the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed.
16:7:2:Then I put my brother Hanani in charge, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most.
16:7:3:I instructed them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. And while the guards are still on duty, have them shut and secure the doors. Appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their guard posts and others near their homes."
16:7:4:The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
16:7:5:So my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles, officials, and common people, so they could be registered by genealogy. I found the genealogical record of those who had first returned, and this is what I discovered:
16:7:6:These are the people of the province who returned from captivity, those whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had exiled, and who came back to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town.
16:7:7:They arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. This is the count of the men of Israel:
16:7:8:The descendants of Parosh, 2,172.

16:7:28:The people of Beth-azmaveth, 42.
16:7:29:The residents of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, 743.
16:7:30:The people of Ramah and Geba, 621.
16:7:31:The residents of Michmas, 122.
16:7:32:The people of Bethel and Ai, 123.
16:7:33:The residents of Nebo, 52.
16:7:34:The descendants of Magbish, 156.
16:7:35:The family of the other Elam, 1,254.
16:7:36:The descendants of Harim, 320.
16:7:37:The people of Jericho, 345.
16:7:38:The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 721.
16:7:39:The descendants of Senaah, 3,930.
16:7:40:These are the priests: the descendants of Jedaiah, through the house of Jeshua, 973.
16:7:41:The children of Immer, 1,052.
16:7:42:The descendants of Pashhur, 1,247.

16:7:44:The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua, through Kadmiel and the sons of Hodevah, 74.
16:7:45:The singers: the children of Asaph, 148.
16:7:46:The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai, 138.
16:7:47:The temple servants: the children of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,
16:7:48:The descendants of Keros, Sia, Padon,
16:7:49:The family of Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai,
16:7:50:The children of Hanan, Giddel, Gahar,
16:7:51:The descendants of Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda,
16:7:52:The family of Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah,
16:7:53:The children of Besai, Meunim, Nephishesim,
16:7:54:The descendants of Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,
16:7:55:The family of Bazlith, Mehida, Harsha,
16:7:56:The children of Barkos, Sisera, Temah,
16:7:57:The descendants of Neziah and Hatipha.
16:7:58:The descendants of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida,
16:7:59:The family of Jaala, Darkon, Giddel,
16:7:60:The children of Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth-hazzebaim, and Amon.
16:7:61:In total, the temple servants and descendants of Solomon's servants numbered 392.
16:7:62:These are the people who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their ancestry or lineage:
16:7:63:The descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 642.
16:7:64:And among the priests: the children of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai, who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
16:7:65:These searched for their genealogical records, but they could not be found; therefore, they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.
16:7:66:The governor ordered them not to partake of the most holy food until a priest could consult the Urim and Thummim.
16:7:67:The entire assembly numbered 42,360,
16:7:68:in addition to their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 245 male and female singers.
16:7:69:They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
16:7:70:435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
16:7:71:Some of the heads of families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 gold drachmas, 50 basins, and 530 priestly garments.
16:7:72:Some of the heads of families gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas.
16:7:73:The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priestly garments.
16:7:74:So the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all the people of Israel settled in their own towns. And when the seventh month came, the people of Israel were in their towns.
16:8:1:In the seventh month, all the people gathered together as one in the square before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded for Israel.
16:8:2:Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which included men, women, and everyone who could understand what they heard. This happened on the first day of the seventh month.
16:8:3:From early morning until noon, he read aloud to everyone who could understand. All the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
16:8:4:Ezra stood on a high wooden platform built for this purpose. Beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left.
16:8:5:Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people, since he was standing above them all. As he opened it, everyone stood up.
16:8:6:He blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people responded with "Amen! Amen!" while raising their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.
16:8:7:The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—helped the people understand the Law while they remained in their places.
16:8:8:They read from the Book of the Law of God clearly and explained the meaning, so that the people could understand what was being read.
16:8:9:Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, "This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.
16:8:10:He continued, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength."
16:8:11:The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve."
16:8:12:Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to share their food with others, and to enjoy great celebration, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
16:8:13:On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to study the words of the Law.
16:8:14:They discovered written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month.
16:8:15:So they announced and proclaimed throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make temporary shelters, as it is written."
16:8:16:The people went out and brought back branches, constructing temporary shelters on their rooftops, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, in the square by the Water Gate, and in the square by the Gate of Ephraim.
16:8:17:The whole assembly of those who had returned from exile made temporary shelters and lived in them. The Israelites had not done this since the days of Joshua son of Nun, and there was great joy.
16:8:18:Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God every day, from the first day to the last. The Israelites celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, they held a sacred assembly according to the prescribed manner.
16:9:1:On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth, with dust on their heads.
16:9:2:Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners, standing and confessing their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.
16:9:3:For a quarter of the day, they read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God, and for another quarter, they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God.
16:9:4:Then the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani—stood on the stairs, crying out loudly to the Lord their God.
16:9:5:The Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, "Stand up and praise the Lord your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
16:9:6:You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, along with all their host, the earth and everything on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the heavenly host worships you.
16:9:7:You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, changing his name to Abraham.
16:9:8:You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites—to give it to his descendants. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
16:9:9:You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16:9:10:You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his officials, and the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly they treated our ancestors. You gained a reputation that endures to this day.
16:9:11:You divided the sea before them, so they passed through it on dry ground. You hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
16:9:12:By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.
16:9:13:You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them just laws, true teachings, good statutes, and commandments.
16:9:14:You revealed your holy Sabbath to them and gave them commandments, statutes, and teachings through your servant Moses.
16:9:15:In their hunger, you provided bread from heaven; in their thirst, you brought water from the rock. You told them to enter and possess the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
16:9:16:But they, our ancestors, acted arrogantly; they became stiff-necked and did not listen to your commands.
16:9:17:They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader to return them to slavery in Egypt. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore, you did not desert them,
16:9:18:even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed terrible blasphemies.
16:9:19:In your great compassion, you did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud still led them by day, and the pillar of fire showed them the way at night.
16:9:20:You gave your good Spirit to instruct them, provided manna for their hunger, and brought water from the rock for their thirst.
16:9:21:For forty years, you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not become swollen.
16:9:22:You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan.
16:9:23:You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess.
16:9:24:Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with as they pleased.
16:9:25:They captured fortified cities and fertile land, took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.
16:9:26:But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them to turn back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.
16:9:27:So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed, they cried out to you. From heaven, you heard them, and in your great compassion, you gave them deliverers who rescued them from the hands of their enemies.
16:9:28:When they had rest, they again did evil before you. Then you abandoned them to the hands of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion, you delivered them time after time.
16:9:29:You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a person will live if they obey them. Stubbornly, they turned their backs on you, stiffened their necks, and refused to listen.
16:9:30:For many years, you were patient with them. By your Spirit, you warned them through your prophets. Yet they would not listen, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples.
16:9:31:But in your great mercy, you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
16:9:32:Now then, our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes—the hardship that has come on us, on our kings and leaders, on our priests and prophets, on our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
16:9:33:In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly.
16:9:34:Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them.
16:9:35:Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.
16:9:36:Now we are slaves. In the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and enjoy its good gifts, we are slaves.
16:9:37:Its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
16:10:1:On that day, leaders of the people bound themselves with a solemn agreement. They were joined by their fellow Israelites, as well as the Levites and priests.
16:10:2:They pledged to follow the Law of God, which had been given through Moses the servant of God. They also vowed to obey all the commandments, regulations, and statutes of the Lord our God.
16:10:3:We promise not to intermarry with the peoples around us, who practice detestable customs.
16:10:4:If our daughters marry foreigners or if we take foreign wives for our sons, we will accept responsibility for this disobedience.
16:10:5:We commit to keeping the Sabbath day holy, as well as observing the Sabbatical year by allowing the land to rest and cancelling debts.
16:10:6:We also pledge to contribute a third of a shekel each year to maintain the temple service.
16:10:7:We will provide the firstfruits of our crops, the firstborn of our sons, and the firstborn of our herds and flocks to the house of our God, in accordance with the Law.
16:10:8:We will bring the best of our dough, our offerings, the fruit of every tree, new wine, and olive oil to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God.
16:10:9:We will give a tenth of our produce to the Levites, who are responsible for collecting the tithes in all the towns where we work.
16:10:10:The Levites will then give a tenth of these tithes to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
16:10:11:We will not neglect the house of our God, ensuring that the needs of the temple and its services are met.
16:10:12:We will honor our responsibilities and commitments, and we will serve our God with dedication and faithfulness.
16:11:1:In Jerusalem, the leaders of the people settled down, while the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in the holy city, and the remaining nine stayed in the other towns.
16:11:2:And the people blessed all those who willingly offered to settle in Jerusalem.
16:11:3:Here is a list of the leaders of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem. However, in the towns of Judah, everyone lived on their own property within their respective towns—the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
16:11:4:Some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin settled in Jerusalem. From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, from the line of Perez;
16:11:5:and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, from the line of Shelah.
16:11:6:The total number of descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem was 468 capable men.
16:11:7:From the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah,
16:11:8:and his followers, Gabbai and Sallai—928 men in all.
16:11:9:Joel son of Zichri was their chief officer, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command over the city.
16:11:10:From the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jachin,
16:11:11:Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader in charge of God's temple,
16:11:12:and their fellow priests who carried out the work of the temple—822 men. Also Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malkijah,
16:11:13:and his associates, who were heads of families—242 men; and Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
16:11:14:and his associates, who were capable men—128. Their chief officer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.
16:11:15:From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
16:11:16:Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the leaders of the Levites, who had oversight of the outside work for the temple;
16:11:17:Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the director who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
16:11:18:The total number of Levites in the holy city was 284.
16:11:19:Additionally, there were 172 gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their associates, who guarded the gates.
16:11:20:The rest of the Israelites, along with the priests and Levites, lived in all the towns of Judah, each on their ancestral property.
16:11:21:The temple servants lived on Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa supervised them.
16:11:22:The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. Uzzi was one of Asaph's descendants, who were the singers responsible for the service of the house of God.
16:11:23:For the king's command was in effect, and a fixed provision was made for the singers, as required daily.
16:11:24:Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, from the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's representative in all matters concerning the people.
16:11:25:As for the settlements outside of Jerusalem, some of the people from Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding villages, in Dibon and its villages, in Jekabzeel and its settlements,
16:11:26:in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet,
16:11:27:in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its villages,
16:11:28:in Ziklag, in Meconah and its villages,
16:11:29:in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
16:11:30:Zanoah, Adullam, and their surrounding villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its settlements. Thus, they encamped from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
16:11:31:Some descendants of Benjamin settled in Geba, Michmash, Aija, and Bethel with its villages,
16:11:32:in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
16:11:33:Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
16:11:34:Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
16:11:35:Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen.
16:11:36:Some groups of Levites who had previously lived in Judah were assigned to live with the tribe of Benjamin.
16:12:1:At this time, these were the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16:12:2:Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16:12:3:Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16:12:4:Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
16:12:5:Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
16:12:6:Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16:12:7:Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
16:12:8:The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who led the songs of thanksgiving with his associates.
16:12:9:Bakbukiah and Unni, their fellow Levites, stood opposite them in the services.
16:12:10:Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,
16:12:11:Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.
16:12:12:In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
16:12:13:of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
16:12:14:of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
16:12:15:of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
16:12:16:of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
16:12:17:of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin and of Moadiah, Piltai;
16:12:18:of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
16:12:19:of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
16:12:20:of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
16:12:21:of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
16:12:22:The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were recorded as heads of families; also the priests, until the reign of Darius the Persian.
16:12:23:The sons of Levi, heads of families, were recorded in the Book of Chronicles up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib.
16:12:24:These were the leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their associates who stood opposite them, to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as commanded by David the man of God.
16:12:25:Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
16:12:26:They served during the time of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
16:12:27:At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy, thanksgiving, and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
16:12:28:The singers were brought together from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
16:12:29:from Beth Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
16:12:30:The priests and Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
16:12:31:Then I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on the top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
16:12:32:Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,
16:12:33:along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16:12:34:Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
16:12:35:and some of the priests with trumpets; Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph;
16:12:36:and his associates: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led them.
16:12:37:At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent of the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
16:12:38:The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of the wall, together with half the people, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
16:12:39:over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.
16:12:40:The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials,
16:12:41:as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with their trumpets—
16:12:42:and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.
16:12:43:That day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
16:12:44:At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.
16:12:45:They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.
16:12:46:For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16:12:47:So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
16:13:1:On that day, they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God.
16:13:2:This was because they had not provided the Israelites with food and water, but instead hired Balaam to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16:13:3:When the people heard this law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.
16:13:4:Before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the storerooms of the house of our God and was related to Tobiah,
16:13:5:had prepared a large room for Tobiah, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, incense, temple articles, tithes of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians, and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.
16:13:6:But during all this time, I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had returned to the king. Later, I asked his permission
16:13:7:and came back to Jerusalem. I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
16:13:8:I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room.
16:13:9:Afterward, I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I brought back the articles of the house of God, along with the grain offerings and incense.
16:13:10:I also learned that the portions for the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and musicians who performed the service had gone back to their own fields.
16:13:11:So I rebuked the officials and asked them, "Why is the house of God neglected?" Then I gathered the Levites and musicians together and stationed them at their posts.
16:13:12:All Judah then brought the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms.
16:13:13:I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites as treasurers in charge of the storerooms, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, as their assistant. These men were considered reliable, and they were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.
16:13:14:Please remember me for this, my God, and do not forget the good I have done for the house of my God and its services.
16:13:15:In those days, I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in sheaves, loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.
16:13:16:The merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.
16:13:17:But I warned them, saying, "Why are you spending the night by the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on, they did not come on the Sabbath.
16:13:18:Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. Please remember me for this also, my God, and show me mercy according to your abundant kindness.
16:13:19:Whenever the gates of Jerusalem began to cast shadows before the Sabbath, I ordered that the doors be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.
16:13:20:Once or twice, the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem.
16:13:21:But I warned them and said, "Why are you camping near the wall? If you do this again, I will use force against you." After that, they did not come back on the Sabbath.
16:13:22:Then I directed the Levites to purify themselves and come guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Please remember me for this, my God, and treat me with kindness according to your great love.
16:13:23:In those days, I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
16:13:24:Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and they could not speak the language of Judah.
16:13:25:I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them swear in the name of God that they would not let their children intermarry with the pagan peoples of the land.
16:13:26:"Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon, king of Israel, sinned? Among the many nations, there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.
16:13:27:Must we now hear that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"
16:13:28:One of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me.
16:13:29:Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
16:13:30:So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task.
16:13:31:I also arranged for the supply of wood at designated times and for the firstfruits. Please remember me favorably, my God.
