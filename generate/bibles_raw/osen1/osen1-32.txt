32:1:1:One day, the Lord spoke to Jonah, son of Amittai, with a message.
32:1:2:He said, "Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, for their wickedness has come before me."
32:1:3:But Jonah decided to run away from the Lord. He went down to Joppa, found a ship bound for Tarshish, paid the fare, and boarded, hoping to escape from God's presence.
32:1:4:However, the Lord sent a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.
32:1:5:Fearing for their lives, the sailors cried out to their gods and threw cargo overboard to lighten the ship. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone below deck, where he fell sound asleep.
32:1:6:The captain approached Jonah and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Perhaps he will take notice of us and spare our lives."
32:1:7:The crew decided to cast lots to determine who was responsible for the calamity. The lot fell on Jonah.
32:1:8:So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for this disaster? What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? What is your country, and who are your people?"
32:1:9:Jonah replied, "I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
32:1:10:Hearing this, the sailors were terrified and asked, "What have you done?" They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had told them.
32:1:11:As the sea grew more and more stormy, they asked Jonah, "What should we do to calm the sea?"
32:1:12:He answered, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea, and it will become calm. I know that this terrible storm is my fault."
32:1:13:Instead of throwing him overboard, the sailors tried to row back to land, but they couldn't because the storm was too fierce.
32:1:14:Finally, they cried out to the Lord, "O Lord, please don't let us die for taking this man's life. Don't hold us accountable for shedding innocent blood, for you have done as you pleased."
32:1:15:Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.
32:1:16:Amazed by this, the sailors feared the Lord even more. They offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
32:1:17:Meanwhile, the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and he remained in its belly for three days and three nights.
32:2:1:Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from inside the fish.
32:2:2:He said, "In my distress, I called out to the Lord, and He answered me. From deep within the realm of the dead, I cried for help, and You heard my voice."
32:2:3:You threw me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, and the currents swirled around me; all Your waves and breakers swept over me.
32:2:4:I thought I was driven away from Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.
32:2:5:The waters surrounded me, even to the point of death; the deep engulfed me, and seaweed wrapped around my head.
32:2:6:I sank down to the roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed behind me forever. But You brought my life up from the pit, O Lord my God.
32:2:7:When my life was ebbing away, I remembered You, Lord, and my prayer reached You in Your holy temple.
32:2:8:Those who cling to worthless idols forsake the mercy that could be theirs.
32:2:9:But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to You. What I have vowed, I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord."
32:2:10:And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
32:3:1:At that time, God's word came to Jonah again, saying,
32:3:2:"Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce to them the message I have given you."
32:3:3:So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh, as the Lord had instructed. It was a vast city, requiring three days to explore.
32:3:4:Jonah started his journey through the city, and after walking for one day, he began to proclaim, "In forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!"
32:3:5:The people of Nineveh believed God's message. They declared a fast and dressed in sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.
32:3:6:When word reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his royal garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
32:3:7:He then issued a decree throughout Nineveh, stating, "By order of the king and his nobles: No person or animal, herd or flock, shall taste anything. They must not eat or drink water.
32:3:8:Both humans and animals should wear sackcloth, and everyone should cry out fervently to God. Let each person turn away from their evil ways and violence.
32:3:9:Who knows? Perhaps God will change his mind, relent from his fierce anger, and we will not perish."
32:3:10:Seeing their actions—that they had turned from their evil ways—God relented from the disaster he had planned to bring upon them, and he did not carry it out.
32:4:1:Jonah was extremely upset about this turn of events and became very angry.
32:4:2:In his frustration, he prayed to the Lord, saying, "Oh Lord, isn't this exactly what I thought would happen when I was still in my own country? That's why I tried to flee to Tarshish in the first place. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and full of steadfast love, always ready to change your mind about inflicting disaster.
32:4:3:So now, Lord, please take my life from me, for it's better for me to die than to live."
32:4:4:The Lord responded, "Is it right for you to be so angry?"
32:4:5:Jonah left the city and found a place to the east where he could sit down and watch what would happen. He made himself a shelter there to protect him from the sun's heat while he waited to see what would become of the city.
32:4:6:Then the Lord arranged for a leafy plant to grow up quickly over Jonah's shelter, providing shade to ease his discomfort. Jonah was delighted with the plant.
32:4:7:But at dawn the next day, God sent a worm to attack the plant, causing it to wither.
32:4:8:As the sun rose, God directed a scorching east wind to blow, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head so intensely that he grew faint. He wished to die, saying, "It would be better for me to die than to live like this."
32:4:9:God asked Jonah, "Do you have a right to be angry about the plant?" Jonah replied, "Yes, I'm so angry I could die!"
32:4:10:Then the Lord said, "You cared about the plant, which you didn't work for and which you didn't cause to grow. It appeared in a night and perished in a night.
32:4:11:Should I not care about Nineveh, that great city, where there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, as well as many animals?"
