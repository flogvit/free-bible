51:1:1:Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51:1:2:To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ at Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
51:1:3:We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51:1:4:because we've heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints.
51:1:5:This faith and love spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven, which you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel
51:1:6:that has come to you. The gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace.
51:1:7:You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
51:1:8:and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
51:1:9:For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
51:1:10:so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
51:1:11:being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience.
51:1:12:Joyfully give thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.
51:1:13:For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
51:1:14:in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51:1:15:Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
51:1:16:For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.
51:1:17:He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51:1:18:And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
51:1:19:For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
51:1:20:and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
51:1:21:Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
51:1:22:But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—
51:1:23:if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
51:1:24:Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
51:1:25:I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—
51:1:26:the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord's people.
51:1:27:To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51:1:28:We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.
51:1:29:For this I labor, striving with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.
51:2:1:In this letter, I want you to know how much I struggle for you and those in Laodicea, as well as for all who have not met me personally.
51:2:2:My goal is that their hearts may be encouraged and united in love, so they may have a complete understanding and knowledge of the mystery of God, which is Christ.
51:2:3:In Him, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
51:2:4:I tell you this so that no one may deceive you with persuasive arguments.
51:2:5:Though I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly conduct and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
51:2:6:Since you have accepted Jesus as the Lord, continue to live your lives rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
51:2:7:Be on guard so that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which relies on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.
51:2:8:For in Christ, the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.
51:2:9:And in Him, you have been made complete, for He is the head over every power and authority.
51:2:10:You were also circumcised in Him, not by a physical procedure, but by putting off the sinful nature through the circumcision performed by Christ.
51:2:11:Having been buried with Him in baptism, you were also raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.
51:2:12:When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
51:2:13:having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.
51:2:14:And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
51:2:15:So don't let anyone judge you in matters of food and drink, or regarding a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day.
51:2:16:These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.
51:2:17:Don't let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such people are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual minds.
51:2:18:They have lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
51:2:19:Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules?
51:2:20:"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!" These rules have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, false humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
51:3:1:So, since you have been raised with Christ, focus your hearts on the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
51:3:2:Keep your thoughts on heavenly matters, not on earthly ones.
51:3:3:For you died, and now your life is hidden with Christ in God.
51:3:4:When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with him in glory.
51:3:5:Therefore, put to death whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
51:3:6:Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon the disobedient.
51:3:7:You used to live this way, when you were part of that lifestyle.
51:3:8:But now, rid yourselves of all such things as anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
51:3:9:Don't lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices
51:3:10:and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
51:3:11:Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.
51:3:12:As God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
51:3:13:Bear with each other and forgive any grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
51:3:14:Above all, put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
51:3:15:Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
51:3:16:Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
51:3:17:And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51:3:18:Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51:3:19:Husbands, love your wives and don't be harsh with them.
51:3:20:Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
51:3:21:Fathers, don't provoke your children, so they won't become discouraged.
51:3:22:Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; not only when they are watching, as if you were trying to please people, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
51:3:23:Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly, as if you were working for the Lord, not for human masters,
51:3:24:since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
51:3:25:But those who do wrong will be repaid for their wrongdoing, and there is no favoritism.
51:4:1:Stay devoted to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
51:4:2:And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so we can proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
51:4:3:Pray that I may declare it clearly, as I should.
51:4:4:Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of every opportunity.
51:4:5:Let your conversation be gracious and seasoned with salt, so you know how to answer everyone.
51:4:6:Tychicus will give you all the news about me. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.
51:4:7:I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
51:4:8:With him is Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will inform you about everything here.
51:4:9:Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),
51:4:10:and Jesus, who is called Justus. These are the only Jewish believers among my coworkers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
51:4:11:Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.
51:4:12:I vouch for him that he has worked hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51:4:13:Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
51:4:14:Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51:4:15:When this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
51:4:16:And tell Archippus, "See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord."
51:4:17:I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
