53:1:1:Dear Thessalonians, this is Paul, Silas, and Timothy writing to you. We send our greetings and God's grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53:1:2:We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.
53:1:3:It's important to remember your growing faith, increasing love for one another, and perseverance through trials. These are evidence of God's work in your lives.
53:1:4:In fact, we proudly tell other churches about your endurance and faith in the midst of persecution and hardships that you face.
53:1:5:This is a clear sign of God's righteous judgment, allowing you to be counted worthy of His Kingdom, for which you are also suffering.
53:1:6:It's only fair that God would repay those who trouble you with trouble of their own,
53:1:7:and provide relief to you who are troubled, as well as to us. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels,
53:1:8:coming in blazing fire to take vengeance on those who don't know God and don't obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
53:1:9:They will suffer eternal punishment, separated from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power,
53:1:10:when He comes on that day to be glorified in His saints and admired by all who believe, including you, because you trusted our testimony.
53:1:11:With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, asking that our God would make you worthy of His calling and fulfill every desire for goodness and every deed prompted by faith,
53:1:12:so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
53:2:1:Now, friends, we want to talk about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be gathered to meet him.
53:2:2:Please don't be easily upset or alarmed by any message, whether it's a prophecy, report, or letter supposedly from us, saying that the Day of the Lord has already come.
53:2:3:Let no one deceive you in any way, for that day won't come unless the rebellion occurs first and the man of sin is revealed, who is the son of destruction.
53:2:4:This man opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship. He takes his seat in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
53:2:5:Don't you remember that when I was with you, I told you about these things?
53:2:6:And now you know what holds him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
53:2:7:The secret power of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who now restrains it will continue to do so until he is taken out of the way.
53:2:8:Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
53:2:9:The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the working of Satan, with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders,
53:2:10:and with every kind of wicked deception directed at those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and be saved.
53:2:11:For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion, leading them to believe the lie,
53:2:12:so that all who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness will be condemned.
53:2:13:But we should always thank God for you, dear friends, whom the Lord loves, because from the beginning he chose you for salvation through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and belief in the truth.
53:2:14:He called you to this through our gospel so that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
53:2:15:So then, stand firm and hold on to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
53:2:16:May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
53:2:17:encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
53:3:1:Finally, friends, please pray for us that the Lord's message may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was among you.
53:3:2:Also, pray that we may be protected from wicked and evil people, for not everyone has faith.
53:3:3:But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
53:3:4:We are confident in the Lord that you are doing, and will continue to do, what we command.
53:3:5:May the Lord guide your hearts toward God's love and Christ's perseverance.
53:3:6:Now we instruct you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any believer who lives an undisciplined life and does not follow the teaching they received from us.
53:3:7:You know how you ought to imitate us because we did not live idly among you.
53:3:8:We didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it; instead, we worked hard night and day so that we wouldn't burden any of you.
53:3:9:It wasn't because we lacked the right, but we wanted to set an example for you to follow.
53:3:10:When we were with you, we gave you this rule: "If someone doesn't want to work, they shouldn't eat."
53:3:11:We've heard that some among you are living idly, not working at all, but meddling in others' affairs.
53:3:12:To those individuals, we command and encourage them in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own living.
53:3:13:As for you, brothers and sisters, don't grow weary in doing good.
53:3:14:If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of them and do not associate with them, so they may feel ashamed.
53:3:15:However, don't treat them as enemies, but warn them as fellow believers.
53:3:16:May the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
53:3:17:I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I sign every letter. This is my signature.
53:3:18:The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
