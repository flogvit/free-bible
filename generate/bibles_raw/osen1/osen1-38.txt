38:1:1: In the eighth month, during the second year of King Darius's reign, the Lord spoke to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo, saying:
38:1:2: "The Lord was very angry with your ancestors.
38:1:3: So now, tell the people: This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: 'Return to me, and I will return to you,' declares the Lord of Heaven's Armies.
38:1:4: Don't be like your ancestors who ignored the earlier prophets' warnings. They were told, 'Abandon your evil ways and deeds,' but they didn't listen or pay attention to me, declares the Lord.
38:1:5: Where are your ancestors now? And those prophets, did they live forever?
38:1:6: But my words and decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your ancestors? They repented and said, 'The Lord of Heaven's Armies has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds, just as he planned.'
38:1:7: On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah, grandson of Iddo, saying:
38:1:8: During the night, I had a vision. I saw a man riding a red horse, standing among myrtle trees in a ravine, with red, sorrel, and white horses behind him.
38:1:9: I asked, 'What are these, my lord?' The angel who was talking with me answered, 'I'll show you what they are.'
38:1:10: Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, 'These are the ones the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.'
38:1:11: And they reported to the angel of the Lord who stood among the myrtle trees, 'We have patrolled the earth, and everything is peaceful and quiet.'
38:1:12: Then the angel of the Lord said, 'Lord of Heaven's Armies, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, which you have been angry with for these seventy years?'
38:1:13: The Lord replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
38:1:14: So the angel told me, 'Announce this message: This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
38:1:15: but I am extremely angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they added to the calamity.'
38:1:16: Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. The measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,' declares the Lord of Heaven's Armies.
38:1:17: 'My towns will again overflow with prosperity. The Lord will once more comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.'"
38:2:1: Next, I looked up and saw four horns.
38:2:2:I asked the angel who was talking with me, "What are these?" He answered, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38:2:3: Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen.
38:2:4:I asked, "What are they coming to do?" He replied, "These are the horns that scattered Judah so no one could raise their head. But the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it."
38:2:5:In my vision, I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38:2:6:So I asked him, "Where are you going?" He replied, "I am going to measure Jerusalem, to find out its width and length."
38:2:7:Then the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel came to meet him.
38:2:8:He said to the first angel, "Run and tell this young man that Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals living there.
38:2:9:For I, the Lord, will be a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory within it."
38:2:10:"Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north," declares the Lord, "for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven," says the Lord.
38:2:11:"Escape, Zion, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon."
38:2:12:For this is what the Lord Almighty says: "After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye—
38:2:13:I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me."
38:2:14:"Shout and be glad, O Daughter of Zion! For I am coming, and I will live among you," declares the Lord.
38:2:15:"Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day and become my people. I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
38:2:16:The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
38:2:17:Be still before the Lord, all mankind, because He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling."
38:3:1:In a vision, the Lord showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord. Satan was there too, ready to accuse him.
38:3:2:The Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebukes you, Satan! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you! Isn't this man like a burning stick snatched from the fire?"
38:3:3:Now Joshua was wearing filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
38:3:4:The angel spoke up and said to those standing nearby, "Take off his filthy clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you."
38:3:5:I spoke up and said, "Let them also place a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and dressed him in fine garments, while the angel of the Lord stood by.
38:3:6:The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:
38:3:7:"This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'If you walk in my ways and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.'"
38:3:8:Listen now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellow priests sitting before you, for these men are a sign of things to come. I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.
38:3:9:Look at the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the Lord Almighty, 'and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.'
38:3:10:'In that day,' declares the Lord Almighty, 'you will invite each other to sit under your vine and fig tree.'"
38:4:1:One day, the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me up, like someone being awakened from a deep sleep.
38:4:2:He asked, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, along with seven pipes for each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
38:4:3:There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left."
38:4:4:I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Sir, what do these things mean?"
38:4:5:The angel answered, "Don't you know what these represent?" I replied, "No, my lord."
38:4:6:Then he explained, "This is the message from the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the Lord Almighty.
38:4:7:'Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel, you will become level ground. He will bring out the capstone to shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'
38:4:8:Furthermore, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
38:4:9:'The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
38:4:10:Who dares despise the day of small things? These seven lamps represent the eyes of the Lord, which range throughout the earth.'
38:4:11:Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?"
38:4:12:And I continued to ask, "What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the golden oil pours out?"
38:4:13:He replied, "Don't you know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord."
38:4:14:Then he explained, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38:5:1:In my vision, I looked up and saw a flying scroll.
38:5:2:The angel asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide."
38:5:3:Then he explained to me, "This is the curse that goes out over the whole land; for everyone who steals will be removed according to what is written on one side, and everyone who swears falsely will be removed according to what is written on the other side.
38:5:4:I will send this curse out," declares the LORD of Hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. It will remain inside their houses and destroy them completely, both their timbers and stones."
38:5:5:The angel who was speaking with me then came forward and said, "Look up and see what is appearing now."
38:5:6:I asked, "What is it?" He answered, "It's a measuring basket that's going out." And he continued, "This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land."
38:5:7:As I watched, the cover of lead was lifted, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket.
38:5:8:The angel said, "This is wickedness." He pushed her back into the basket and closed the lead cover over its opening.
38:5:9:I looked up again and saw two women coming forward, with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
38:5:10:I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"
38:5:11:He replied, "To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there on its base."
38:6:1:Again, I looked up and saw four chariots emerging from between two mountains. The mountains were made of bronze.
38:6:2:The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot had black horses,
38:6:3:the third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot had dappled-gray horses.
38:6:4:I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38:6:5:The angel replied, "These are the four winds of heaven, going out after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.
38:6:6:The chariot with the black horses is going to the north country, the white horses are going to the west country, and the dappled-gray horses are going to the south country."
38:6:7:Then the strong horses went out, eager to patrol the earth. And the angel said, "Go, patrol the earth!" So they patrolled the earth.
38:6:8:Afterward, he called out to me, "Look, those going to the north country have brought peace to my spirit in the north country."
38:6:9:Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
38:6:10:"Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
38:6:11:Take silver and gold, make crowns, and set one on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
38:6:12:Tell him, 'This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Here is a man whose name is the Branch; he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord.
38:6:13:He will build the temple of the Lord, and he will be clothed in splendor. He will sit and rule on his throne, and there will be a priest beside him on his throne. They will work together in harmony.'
38:6:14:The crowns will be a memorial in the temple of the Lord for Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and the son of Zephaniah.
38:6:15:Those who are far away will come and help build the temple of the Lord, and you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God."
38:7:1:In the fourth year of King Darius, on the fourth day of the ninth month (Kislev), a message from the Lord came to Zechariah.
38:7:2:People from Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech, along with their men, to seek the favor of the Lord
38:7:3:and ask the priests in the temple of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, "Should we continue to mourn and fast during the fifth month as we have done for so many years?"
38:7:4:Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me:
38:7:5:"Say to all the people of the land and the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
38:7:6:And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves?
38:7:7:Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at peace and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were inhabited?'"
38:7:8:Again, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah:
38:7:9:"This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Administer true justice, show mercy and compassion to one another.
38:7:10:Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.'
38:7:11:But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears.
38:7:12:They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
38:7:13:'When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,' says the Lord Almighty.
38:7:14:I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate."
38:8:1:The Lord of Hosts proclaims, "I am intensely passionate for Zion, and I am filled with great zeal for her."
38:8:2:"Thus says the Lord: 'I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the Lord of Hosts, the Holy Mountain.'
38:8:3:"This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Old men and women will once again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand due to their old age.
38:8:4:"The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.'
38:8:5:"The Lord of Hosts declares, 'Though it may seem impossible to the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be impossible for me?'"
38:8:6:"This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Behold, I will save my people from the east country and the west country.
38:8:7:"I will bring them back, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and righteousness.'
38:8:8:"The Lord of Hosts proclaims, 'Be strong, you who hear these words from the mouths of the prophets who were present when the foundation of the house of the Lord of Hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
38:8:9:"For before those days there was no wage for man or beast, nor was there any peace from the adversary for those who went out or came in; but now I have set the remnant of my people free from the hands of their enemies.'
38:8:10:"This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'In this place, there will once again be a harvest of peace; the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will give its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
38:8:11:"Just as I determined to bring disaster upon you when your ancestors provoked me to anger,' says the Lord of Hosts, 'so now I have decided to do good again to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.
38:8:12:"These are the things you should do: Speak the truth to one another, render true and perfect justice in your gates,
38:8:13:"Do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and do not love false oaths; for all these are things that I hate,' declares the Lord."
38:8:14:The Lord of Hosts proclaims, "I had planned to punish you when your ancestors angered me," says the Lord of Hosts, "and I did not relent.
38:8:15:"But now I plan to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah; do not fear.
38:8:16:"These are the things you must do: Speak the truth to one another, judge with truth and complete justice in your courts,
38:8:17:"Do not plot evil against each other, and do not swear falsely. I hate all these things," declares the Lord.
38:8:18:The word of the Lord of Hosts came to me, saying,
38:8:19:"The Lord of Hosts says, 'The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become times of joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.'
38:8:20:"This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Peoples will yet come, inhabitants of many cities.
38:8:21:"The inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord and seek the Lord of Hosts. I myself am going."
38:8:22:"Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the Lord of Hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the Lord.'
38:8:23:"This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'In those days, ten men from every language of the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'"
38:9:1:Zechariah 9 opens with a prophecy against Hadrach, Damascus, and the cities of the Philistines. The Lord's eye is on all people, and His judgment will come upon them.
38:9:2:Tyre and Sidon, though they think themselves wise, will not escape the Lord's wrath. Their fortresses will be destroyed, and their wealth taken away.
38:9:3:Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the other Philistine cities will suffer the same fate. The Lord will remove their kings and put an end to their idolatry.
38:9:4:The people of these cities will be humbled, but the Lord will preserve a remnant of His faithful followers among them.
38:9:5:Jerusalem will be protected from her enemies, and her king will bring peace and righteousness.
38:9:6:The Lord will save His people, and they will rejoice in His victory over their enemies.
38:9:7:God's people will be like a mighty warrior who tramples their enemies underfoot, and the Lord will be with them in battle.
38:9:8:On that day, the Lord will protect Jerusalem, and no enemy will be able to harm her.
38:9:9:Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Your king is coming to you; He is just and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38:9:10:He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the warhorse from Jerusalem. The weapons of war will be broken, and He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
38:9:11:As for you, because of the blood of your covenant, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
38:9:12:Return to your fortress, O prisoners of hope; even now, I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
38:9:13:I will bend Judah as my bow and fit it with Ephraim as my arrow. I will rouse your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and make you like a warrior's sword.
38:9:14:Then the Lord will appear over them, and His arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet; He will march in the storms of the south.
38:9:15:The Lord Almighty will shield them, and they will devour their enemies, trampling them like sling stones. They will drink and roar as if intoxicated with wine, and they will be filled like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
38:9:16:On that day, the Lord their God will save them, as the flock of His people. For like the jewels of a crown, they will shine on His land.
38:9:17:How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
38:10:1:Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime, and He will send showers to water the earth.
38:10:2:For idols speak deceitfully, and diviners see illusions; they tell false dreams and provide empty comfort. Therefore, the people wander like sheep, oppressed because there is no shepherd.
38:10:3:My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders. For the Lord of Hosts cares for His flock, the house of Judah, and will make them strong like a majestic horse in battle.
38:10:4:From Judah will come the cornerstone, the tent peg, and the bow of war. From them, every ruler will emerge.
38:10:5:Together, they will be like warriors trampling their enemies in the mud of the streets during battle. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and they will put their adversaries to shame.
38:10:6:I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them, and they will be as though I had never rejected them. For I am the Lord their God, and I will answer their prayers.
38:10:7:The people of Ephraim will become like mighty warriors, and their hearts will rejoice as if with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will delight in the Lord.
38:10:8:I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them, and they will increase as they once did.
38:10:9:Though I scattered them among the nations, in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive and return.
38:10:10:I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon until there is no more room for them.
38:10:11:They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued, and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria's pride will be brought down, and Egypt's scepter will depart.
38:10:12:I will strengthen them in the Lord, and in His name they will live securely, declares the Lord.
38:11:1:Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may consume your cedars.
38:11:2:Wail, you cypress trees, for the cedars have fallen; the majestic ones are destroyed. Cry out, you oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest has been cut down.
38:11:3:Listen to the shepherds' cries as their splendor is laid waste. Hear the roaring of young lions, for the lush pastures along the Jordan have been ravaged.
38:11:4:This is what the Lord my God says: "Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
38:11:5:Their buyers kill them without remorse, and those who sell them say, 'Praise the Lord, for I have become rich!' Even their own shepherds show them no compassion.
38:11:6:For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the Lord. "I will hand everyone over to their neighbors and their king. They will oppress the land, and I will not rescue them from their grasp."
38:11:7:So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. I took two staffs, naming one Favor and the other Union, and I tended the flock.
38:11:8:In a single month, I got rid of three shepherds. My patience had worn thin, and I was fed up with them, just as they were with me.
38:11:9:Then I said, "I won't be your shepherd anymore. Let those who are dying die, and those who are perishing perish. Let the survivors devour each other's flesh."
38:11:10:Next, I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
38:11:11:It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the Lord.
38:11:12:I told them, "If you think it best, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
38:11:13:Then the Lord said to me, "Throw it to the potter—the handsome price at which they valued me!" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the Lord.
38:11:14:After that, I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
38:11:15:Then the Lord said to me, "Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38:11:16:For I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the lost, seek the young, heal the injured, or feed the healthy. Instead, he will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and tear off their hooves.
38:11:17:Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm wither and his right eye lose its sight."
38:12:1:This is the message from the Lord concerning Israel: I, the Lord, stretch out the heavens, lay the foundations of the earth, and form the spirit within humans.
38:12:2:Look, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering for all the surrounding peoples. When they besiege Jerusalem, both Judah and the city itself will be affected.
38:12:3:On that day, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all nations. All who try to move it will hurt themselves, for all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
38:12:4:In that time, says the Lord, I will strike every horse with confusion and its rider with madness. But I will watch over the people of Judah, while striking all the horses of the nations with blindness.
38:12:5:Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts, 'The people of Jerusalem have strength because of the Lord Almighty, their God.'
38:12:6:On that day, I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
38:12:7:The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and the honor of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.
38:12:8:On that day, the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem; even the weakest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of the Lord going before them.
38:12:9:On that day, I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38:12:10:I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.
38:12:11:On that day, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38:12:12:The land will mourn, each family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38:12:13:the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38:12:14:and all the remaining families, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
38:13:1:In that day, a fountain will be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
38:13:2:On that day, declares the Lord of Hosts, I will remove the names of the idols from the land, so that they will be remembered no more. I will also rid the land of false prophets and the spirit of impurity.
38:13:3:If anyone still prophesies, their father and mother who gave birth to them will say, "You must die, for you have spoken lies in the name of the Lord." And their own parents will pierce them through when they prophesy.
38:13:4:On that day, every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet's garment of hair in order to deceive.
38:13:5:Instead, they will say, "I am not a prophet; I am a farmer, for I have worked the land since my youth."
38:13:6:If someone asks, "What are these wounds on your body?" they will answer, "These wounds I received at the house of my friends."
38:13:7:"Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me," declares the Lord of Hosts. "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones."
38:13:8:In the whole land, says the Lord, two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
38:13:9:I will bring that remaining third through the fire, refining them like silver and testing them like gold. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, "They are my people," and they will say, "The Lord is our God."
38:14:1:The day is coming when the Lord will gather all nations to fight against Jerusalem. The city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women assaulted. Half of the people will be taken into exile, but the rest will remain in the city.
38:14:2:Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, just as he has fought in times past.
38:14:3:On that day, his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the mountain will split in two from east to west, forming a great valley with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.
38:14:4:You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azal. Yes, you will flee as you did from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
38:14:5:On that day, there will be no light, no cold or frost.
38:14:6:It will be a unique day—a day known only to the Lord—with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.
38:14:7:On that day, living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it flowing east to the Dead Sea and half of it flowing west to the Mediterranean Sea, both in summer and winter.
38:14:8:The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord, and his name the only name.
38:14:9:The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
38:14:10:People will live there, and there will be no more curse; Jerusalem will dwell securely.
38:14:11:This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
38:14:12:On that day, a great panic from the Lord will spread among them. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another.
38:14:13:Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing.
38:14:14:A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
38:14:15:Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:16:If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, they will have no rain.
38:14:17:If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The Lord will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:18:This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
38:14:19:On that day, HOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the Lord's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.
38:14:20:Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord Almighty.
