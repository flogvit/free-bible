36:1:1:The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah:
36:1:2:I will completely sweep away everything from the face of the earth, declares the LORD.
36:1:3:I will wipe out people and animals; I will remove the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea. The wicked will be cut off along with the stumbling blocks, and I will destroy humanity from the earth, declares the LORD.
36:1:4:I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will eliminate every remnant of Baal from this place, the names of the idolatrous priests,
36:1:5:as well as those who worship the host of heaven on the rooftops, those who swear allegiance to the LORD while also swearing by Milcom,
36:1:6:and those who have turned back from following the LORD, who neither seek the LORD nor inquire of him.
36:1:7:Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near; the LORD has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests.
36:1:8:On the day of the LORD's sacrifice, I will punish the princes, the king's sons, and all who dress in foreign attire.
36:1:9:On that day, I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
36:1:10:On that day, says the LORD, a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
36:1:11:Wail, inhabitants of the Mortar! For all the merchants will be silenced; those who weigh out silver will be cut off.
36:1:12:At that time, I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who think in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good, nor will he do harm.'
36:1:13:Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses a desolation. They will build houses but not inhabit them, and plant vineyards but not drink their wine.
36:1:14:The great day of the LORD is near, near and coming quickly. The sound of the day of the LORD is bitter; even the mighty warriors cry out.
36:1:15:That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of devastation and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
36:1:16:a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities and high corner towers.
36:1:17:I will bring such distress upon humanity that they will walk like the blind because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
36:1:18:Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath. In the fire of his jealousy, the whole earth will be consumed; for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth.
36:2:1:Gather together, yes, gather yourselves, O nation without shame,
36:2:2:before the decree takes effect and the day passes like chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the day of the LORD's wrath arrives.
36:2:3:Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth, who have obeyed His commands; seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD's anger.
36:2:4:For Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon left in ruins; Ashdod will be driven out at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
36:2:5:Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will destroy you until no inhabitant remains.
36:2:6:The seacoast will become pastureland, with wells for shepherds and folds for flocks.
36:2:7:The coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah; they will find pasture there. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon, for the LORD their God will care for them and restore their fortunes.
36:2:8:I have heard the taunts of Moab and the insults of the Ammonites, who have taunted My people and threatened their borders.
36:2:9:Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, Moab will become like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrahâ€”a place of weeds and salt pits, a perpetual wasteland. The remnant of My people will plunder them; the survivors of My nation will inherit their land.
36:2:10:This is what they will get in return for their pride, for taunting and mocking the people of the LORD of Hosts.
36:2:11:The LORD will be terrifying to them when He starves all the gods of the earth; then the nations of every shore will worship Him, each in its own place.
36:2:12:You also, O Cushites, will be slain by My sword.
36:2:13:And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria, making Nineveh a desolation, as dry as a desert.
36:2:14:Flocks will lie down in her midst, all kinds of animals; even the cormorant and the hedgehog will lodge among her columns. Their calls will echo through the windows; rubble will be in the doorways, and the beams of cedar will be exposed.
36:2:15:This is the city that was so secure in its self, that said in its heart, "I am, and there is none besides me." What a ruin it has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her will hiss and shake their fists.
36:3:1:Woe to the rebellious and polluted city, the oppressive Jerusalem!
36:3:2:She has not listened to the voice of the Lord; she has not accepted correction. She has not trusted in the Lord; she has not drawn near to her God.
36:3:3:Her rulers within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves that leave nothing till the morning.
36:3:4:Her prophets are reckless and treacherous people; her priests have defiled the sanctuary, they have violated the law.
36:3:5:The Lord is righteous in her midst; He does no wrong. Morning by morning, He brings His justice to light, but the unjust know no shame.
36:3:6:I have cut off nations; their strongholds are desolate. I have left their streets empty, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste, without a single inhabitant.
36:3:7:I said, "Surely you will fear Me, you will accept correction." Then her dwelling would not be cut off, despite everything for which I punished her. But they were eager to act corruptly in all they did.
36:3:8:Therefore wait for Me," declares the Lord, "for the day when I rise up as a witness. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out My indignation upon them, all My burning anger; for by the fire of My jealousy, the whole earth will be consumed.
36:3:9:For then I will restore pure speech to the peoples, so that they may all call on the name of the Lord, to serve Him with one accord.
36:3:10:From beyond the rivers of Cush, My worshipers, the daughter of My dispersed ones, will bring My offering.
36:3:11:On that day, you will not be put to shame for all the deeds by which you have rebelled against Me; for then I will remove from your midst those who exult in pride, and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain.
36:3:12:But I will leave within you a humble and lowly people, who will take refuge in the name of the Lord.
36:3:13:The remnant of Israel will do no wrong; they will speak no lies, nor will deceit be found in their mouths. They will feed and lie down, with no one to make them afraid."
36:3:14:Sing, Daughter Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
36:3:15:The Lord has taken away your punishment; He has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst; you will fear disaster no more.
36:3:16:On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp.
36:3:17:The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in His love, He will no longer rebuke you but will rejoice over you with singing."
36:3:18:I will gather those among you who grieve over the appointed festivals, so that you no longer suffer reproach.
36:3:19:Behold, at that time, I will deal with all who oppress you. I will save the lame and gather the scattered, and I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame.
36:3:20:At that time, I will bring you home, even at the time when I gather you; for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes," says the Lord.
