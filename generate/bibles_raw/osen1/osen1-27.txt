27:1:1:In the third year of King Jehoiakim's reign over Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
27:1:2:The Lord allowed Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, to be captured by Nebuchadnezzar, along with some sacred items from the temple of God. These items were then taken to the land of Babylonia and placed in the treasure house of Nebuchadnezzar's god.
27:1:3:King Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz, his chief official, to select young men from the royal family and nobility of Israel.
27:1:4:These young men were to be without physical defects, handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, quick learners, and capable of serving in the king's palace. They were to be taught the language and literature of the Babylonians.
27:1:5:The king provided them with a daily portion of the royal food and wine for three years. After that, they would serve in the king's court.
27:1:6:Among these young men were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were from the tribe of Judah.
27:1:7:The chief official gave them Babylonian names: Daniel was called Belteshazzar, Hananiah was renamed Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah was known as Abednego.
27:1:8:Daniel decided not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, so he asked the chief official for permission to eat only vegetables and drink water.
27:1:9:God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the eyes of the chief official.
27:1:10:However, the official was concerned that Daniel and his friends would appear weaker than the other young men if they only ate vegetables and drank water.
27:1:11:So Daniel proposed a test to the guard assigned to them by the chief official.
27:1:12:Daniel said, "Please test us for ten days by giving us only vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27:1:13:After the ten days, compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food. Then you can decide how to treat us based on what you see."
27:1:14:The guard agreed to the test and gave them only vegetables and water for ten days.
27:1:15:At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had eaten the royal food.
27:1:16:So the guard continued to provide them with vegetables and water, taking away the royal food and wine.
27:1:17:God blessed these four young men with knowledge and understanding in all kinds of literature and learning. Daniel was also given insight into visions and dreams.
27:1:18:When the three-year training period ordered by the king was completed, the chief official presented all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27:1:19:The king spoke with each of them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the king's service.
27:1:20:In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.
27:1:21:Daniel remained in the king's service until the first year of King Cyrus.
27:2:1:In the second year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he had dreams that troubled his spirit and robbed him of sleep.
27:2:2:So the king summoned magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers to explain his dreams. When they came and stood before him,
27:2:3:he said to them, "I've had a dream that disturbs me, and I need to know its meaning."
27:2:4:The wise men replied in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell us your dream, and we will interpret it for you."
27:2:5:But the king answered, "My decision is firm: if you don't reveal both the dream and its interpretation, you'll be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into rubble.
27:2:6:However, if you can tell me the dream and its meaning, you'll receive gifts, rewards, and great honor from me. So tell me the dream and its interpretation."
27:2:7:They responded again, "Please, let the king tell us the dream, and we will explain its meaning."
27:2:8:The king insisted, "I know for certain that you're stalling because you see my decision is final.
27:2:9:If you don't reveal the dream, there's only one penalty for you. You've conspired to speak false and misleading words before me until the situation changes. So tell me the dream, and I'll know that you can interpret it for me."
27:2:10:The wise men answered the king, "No one on earth can do what the king asks! No king, however great or powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.
27:2:11:What the king requests is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, who don't live among humans."
27:2:12:This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
27:2:13:So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to kill them as well.
27:2:14:When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke with wisdom and tact.
27:2:15:He asked Arioch, "Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
27:2:16:At this, Daniel went in to the king and requested more time, so he could interpret the dream for him.
27:2:17:Then Daniel returned to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, about the matter,
27:2:18:urging them to pray to the God of heaven for mercy concerning this mystery, so they wouldn't be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon.
27:2:19:The mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision during the night. So Daniel praised the God of heaven,
27:2:20:saying, "Praise be to the name of God forever and ever; wisdom and power are His.
27:2:21:He changes times and seasons; He deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
27:2:22:He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with Him.
27:2:23:To You, O God of my ancestors, I give thanks and praise, for You have given me wisdom and strength, and have now revealed to me what we asked of You. You've made known to us the king's dream."
27:2:24:Afterward, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Don't execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."
27:2:25:Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means."
27:2:26:The king asked Daniel, also known as Belteshazzar, "Can you tell me the dream I had and its interpretation?"
27:2:27:Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician, or astrologer can reveal the king's mystery,
27:2:28:but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you your dream and the visions that came to your mind while you were in bed.
27:2:29:O king, as you lay in bed, thoughts about the future came to you, and the Revealer of Mysteries has shown you what is going to happen.
27:2:30:This mystery was revealed to me not because I have more wisdom than anyone else, but so that you may know its meaning and understand the thoughts in your heart.
27:2:31:You looked, O king, and saw a huge statue standing before you. The statue was dazzling and enormous, and its appearance was terrifying.
27:2:32:The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,
27:2:33:its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.
27:2:34:As you watched, a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, smashing them.
27:2:35:Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were all broken into pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
27:2:36:This was the dream, and now we will interpret it for the king.
27:2:37:You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion, power, strength, and glory.
27:2:38:In your hands He has placed all mankind, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air. He has made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.
27:2:39:After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.
27:2:40:The fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron, for iron breaks and smashes everything, and like iron that crushes, it will break and crush all the others.
27:2:41:As you saw the feet and toes partly of baked clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some strength of iron in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with clay.
27:2:42:The toes of the feet were part iron and part clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
27:2:43:As you saw the iron mixed with clay, the people will mix with one another but will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.
27:2:44:In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.
27:2:45:This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces. The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy."
27:2:46:King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor, ordering that an offering and incense be presented to him.
27:2:47:The king said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and the Revealer of Mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."
27:2:48:Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, making him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.
27:2:49:At Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be in charge of the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
27:3:1:King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27:3:2:He then summoned all the officials—governors, prefects, satraps, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all other provincial authorities—to attend the dedication ceremony of the statue he had erected.
27:3:3:So, all these officials gathered for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, standing before it.
27:3:4:A herald loudly proclaimed, "People of every nation and language, you are commanded:
27:3:5:When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27:3:6:Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."
27:3:7:As soon as they heard the sound of the music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27:3:8:Some Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27:3:9:They said, "O king, live forever!
27:3:10:You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the music must fall down and worship the golden statue.
27:3:11:And whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
27:3:12:But there are some Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up."
27:3:13:Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were brought before the king.
27:3:14:Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden statue I have set up?
27:3:15:Now, when you hear the sound of the music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the statue I made, good! But if you refuse to worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?"
27:3:16:Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
27:3:17:If the God we serve is able to save us from the blazing furnace and from your hand, O king, He will.
27:3:18:But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up."
27:3:19:Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual
27:3:20:and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
27:3:21:So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
27:3:22:The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
27:3:23:And these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.
27:3:24:Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."
27:3:25:He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."
27:3:26:Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.
27:3:27:The satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.
27:3:28:Nebuchadnezzar declared, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command, risking their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
27:3:29:Therefore, I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut into pieces and their houses turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."
27:3:30:Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27:4:1: King Nebuchadnezzar sent a message to all the people, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: "Peace be multiplied to you!
27:4:2: It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
27:4:3: How great are His signs, and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion endures from generation to generation.
27:4:4: I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
27:4:5: I had a dream that made me afraid; as I lay on my bed, the visions going through my mind alarmed me.
27:4:6: So I issued a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
27:4:7: The magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
27:4:8: Finally, Daniel came into my presence (he is also called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god), and in him is the spirit of the holy gods. I told him the dream:
27:4:9: "O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me.
27:4:10: These were the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.
27:4:11: The tree grew large and strong; its top touched the sky, and it was visible to the ends of the earth.
27:4:12: Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it, the wild animals found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; every creature was fed from it.
27:4:13: In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy messenger, coming down from heaven.
27:4:14: He called out in a loud voice, 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
27:4:15: But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze, surrounded by the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.
27:4:16: Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, until seven times pass by for him.
27:4:17: This decision is announced by the holy messengers, so that the living may know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone He wishes, and sets over them the lowliest of people.'
27:4:18: This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
27:4:19: Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!
27:4:20: The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,
27:4:21: with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds—
27:4:22: Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
27:4:23: And the king saw a holy messenger coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the animals, until seven times pass by for him.'
27:4:24: This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:
27:4:25: You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone He wishes.
27:4:26: The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
27:4:27: Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue."
27:4:28: All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27:4:29: Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
27:4:30: he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?"
27:4:31: Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.
27:4:32: You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like an ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone He wishes."
27:4:33: Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like an ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
27:4:34: At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified Him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
27:4:35: All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as He pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back His hand or say to Him: "What have you done?"
27:4:36: At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne, and I became even greater than before.
27:4:37: Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything He does is right and all His ways are just. And those who walk in pride He is able to humble.
27:5:1:King Belshazzar hosted a grand feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them all.
27:5:2:While under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar commanded that the gold and silver vessels be brought to him. These were the ones that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines could drink from them.
27:5:3:So they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines drank from them.
27:5:4:As they drank the wine, they praised their gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27:5:5:At that moment, the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster wall of the royal palace, near the lampstand. The king saw the hand as it wrote.
27:5:6:The king's face turned pale, and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.
27:5:7:In a loud voice, the king called for the enchanters, astrologers, and diviners to come before him. He said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me its meaning will be clothed in purple, wear a gold chain around his neck, and be the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27:5:8:All the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or interpret its meaning for the king.
27:5:9:King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face grew paler, and his nobles were perplexed.
27:5:10:Hearing the commotion, the queen entered the banquet hall and said, "O king, live forever! Do not be alarmed or let your face turn pale.
27:5:11:There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father, he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners.
27:5:12:This man, Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, has exceptional ability and knowledge to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Summon Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means."
27:5:13:So Daniel was brought before the king, who asked him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?
27:5:14:I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you possess insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom.
27:5:15:The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and interpret its meaning, but they could not provide an explanation.
27:5:16:I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me its meaning, you will be clothed in purple, wear a gold chain around your neck, and become the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27:5:17:Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.
27:5:18:Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty, greatness, glory, and splendor.
27:5:19:Because of the great authority God gave him, people of all nations, races, and languages trembled in fear before him. He could put to death or let live whomever he wished, exalt or humble anyone as he pleased.
27:5:20:But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.
27:5:21:He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with wild donkeys, ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes.
27:5:22:But you, Belshazzar, his son, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.
27:5:23:You have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the vessels from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.
27:5:24:That is why he sent the hand that wrote this inscription.
27:5:25:This is the message that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.
27:5:26:Here is what these words mean: MENE: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
27:5:27:TEKEL: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.
27:5:28:PERES: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."
27:5:29:Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
27:5:30:That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain.
27:5:31:Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
27:6:1:During Darius' reign, it pleased him to appoint 120 regional governors over his kingdom.
27:6:2:He also chose three administrators, including Daniel, to oversee these governors and ensure no corruption or mismanagement occurred.
27:6:3:Daniel's exceptional abilities soon became evident, and the king considered placing him in charge of the entire realm.
27:6:4:This prospect made the other administrators and governors envious, so they sought a way to discredit Daniel.
27:6:5:However, they could find no fault in Daniel's character or work, as he was honest and without corruption.
27:6:6:Realizing this, they decided to use Daniel's faithfulness to God against him, by creating a conflict between his religious beliefs and the law.
27:6:7:The conspirators approached King Darius with a proposal to issue an edict forbidding anyone from praying to any god or human except the king for thirty days.
27:6:8:They claimed that this decree would solidify the king's authority and respect among the people.
27:6:9:King Darius, persuaded by their arguments, signed the edict into law.
27:6:10:When Daniel learned about the new law, he continued to pray to God three times daily, just as he had always done, with his windows open toward Jerusalem.
27:6:11:His enemies observed him praying and reported it to the king.
27:6:12:They reminded King Darius of the edict and accused Daniel of defying it.
27:6:13:Upon hearing this, the king was deeply distressed, realizing he had been manipulated, but the law could not be changed.
27:6:14:Reluctantly, he ordered Daniel to be thrown into the lions' den, hoping that Daniel's God would save him.
27:6:15:A stone was placed over the entrance of the den, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and those of his nobles to ensure no one could rescue Daniel.
27:6:16:That night, King Darius couldn't sleep or eat, consumed by worry for Daniel.
27:6:17:At dawn, he hurried to the lions' den and called out to Daniel, hoping that his God had saved him.
27:6:18:Daniel responded, telling the king that God had sent an angel to shut the lions' mouths and protect him, as he was found innocent before God and had done no wrong to the king.
27:6:19:Overjoyed, King Darius ordered Daniel to be lifted from the den, and there wasn't a scratch on him.
27:6:20:The king then commanded that those who had conspired against Daniel be thrown into the lions' den, along with their families. The lions tore them apart before they even hit the ground.
27:6:21:Afterward, King Darius issued a decree that all people in his kingdom should respect and honor the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, whose reign endures forever.
27:6:22:His kingdom will never be destroyed, and His rule will continue until the end of time.
27:6:23:He rescues and saves, performing signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, including saving Daniel from the lions.
27:6:24:As a result, Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the subsequent reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27:7:1:In the first year of King Belshazzar's reign in Babylon, Daniel had a dream and saw visions as he lay on his bed. He wrote down the dream, recording a summary of it.
27:7:2:Daniel spoke up, saying, "I saw in my vision by night, four great winds stirring up the vast sea.
27:7:3:Then, out of the sea, four enormous beasts emerged, each one different from the others.
27:7:4:The first beast resembled a lion but had eagle's wings. As I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted from the ground, made to stand on two feet like a human, and given a human mind.
27:7:5:Next, I saw a beast resembling a bear. It was raised up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. A voice said to it, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'
27:7:6:After this, I observed another beast, like a leopard, with four bird-like wings on its back. This beast also had four heads, and it was granted authority to rule.
27:7:7:Finally, in my night visions, I saw a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful, exceedingly strong, with iron teeth. It devoured and crushed everything, trampling the remains underfoot. This beast was different from all the previous ones and had ten horns.
27:7:8:While contemplating the horns, I noticed another small horn emerging among them. Three of the original horns were uprooted before it. This new horn had eyes like a human and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
27:7:9:As I looked on, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame, with wheels of blazing fire.
27:7:10:A river of fire flowed from His presence. Thousands upon thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court convened, and the books were opened.
27:7:11:I continued to watch because of the boastful words spoken by the horn. I observed until the beast was slain, its body destroyed, and cast into the blazing fire.
27:7:12:As for the other beasts, their authority was removed, but they were allowed to live for a period of time.
27:7:13:In my night visions, I saw one like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence.
27:7:14:He was given authority, glory, and sovereign power over all nations and peoples; everyone will serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom will never be destroyed.
27:7:15:I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.
27:7:16:I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him the meaning of all this. So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:
27:7:17:'The four great beasts are four kings who will rise from the earth.
27:7:18:But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever—yes, for all eternity.'
27:7:19:Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, extremely terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, devouring, crushing, and trampling underfoot whatever was left.
27:7:20:I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that emerged, before which three of them fell—the horn with eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
27:7:21:As I watched, this horn waged war against the holy ones and was prevailing over them,
27:7:22:until the Ancient of Days arrived and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. The time came for them to possess the kingdom.
27:7:23:He explained, 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.
27:7:24:The ten horns represent ten kings who will rise from this kingdom. After them, another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.
27:7:25:He will speak out against the Most High and oppress the holy ones, intending to change the appointed times and laws. The holy ones will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time.
27:7:26:But the court will convene, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.
27:7:27:Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. Their kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey them.'
27:7:28:This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself."
27:8:1:In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.
27:8:2:In my vision, I saw myself in the citadel of Susa, in the province of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai Canal.
27:8:3:As I looked up, I saw a ram with two horns standing beside the canal. The horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew up later.
27:8:4:I watched as the ram charged toward the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great.
27:8:5:As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.
27:8:6:The goat approached the two-horned ram with powerful force, and I saw it attack the ram furiously.
27:8:7:I observed the goat strike the ram and break its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from its control.
27:8:8:The goat became very great, but at the height of its power, the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
27:8:9:Out of one of these horns emerged a small horn, which grew exceedingly powerful toward the south, the east, and the beautiful land.
27:8:10:It grew until it reached the host of heaven, causing some of the starry host and their leader to fall to the earth and trampling them underfoot.
27:8:11:This horn even challenged the Prince of the heavenly host, taking away from him the daily sacrifice and desecrating his sanctuary.
27:8:12:In an act of rebellion, it was given authority over the daily sacrifice, along with the truth, which it cast to the ground. It prospered in everything it did.
27:8:13:Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, "How long will this vision of the daily sacrifice and the rebellion that causes desolation continue, allowing the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?"
27:8:14:He replied, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."
27:8:15:When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then someone who looked like a man stood before me.
27:8:16:And I heard a man's voice calling from the Ulai Canal, "Gabriel, explain the vision to this man."
27:8:17:As Gabriel approached me, I was terrified and fell facedown. He said, "Son of man, understand that the vision concerns the time of the end."
27:8:18:As he spoke, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me, raising me to my feet.
27:8:19:He said, "I am here to explain to you what will happen in the last days of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end.
27:8:20:The two-horned ram you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
27:8:21:The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.
27:8:22:The four horns that replaced the broken one represent four kingdoms that will arise from his nation but not with the same power.
27:8:23:In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will rise.
27:8:24:His power will be mighty, but not by his own strength. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the powerful and the holy people.
27:8:25:Through his cunning, he will cause deceit to prosper, and in his own mind, he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human hands.
27:8:26:The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given to you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future."
27:8:27:I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was amazed by the vision but could not understand it.
27:9:1:In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,
27:9:2:During that time, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem would lie desolate for seventy years.
27:9:3:So I turned my attention to the Lord God, seeking him through prayer and pleading, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
27:9:4:I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed, saying, "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant and shows mercy to those who love him and keep his commandments,
27:9:5:We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly and rebelled, turning away from your commands and ordinances.
27:9:6:We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our leaders, our fathers, and all the people of the land.
27:9:7:Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, near and far, in every country where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you.
27:9:8:O Lord, we and our kings, our leaders, and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned against you.
27:9:9:But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;
27:9:10:We have not obeyed the Lord our God or followed the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
27:9:11:All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you. Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us because we have sinned against you.
27:9:12:You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us a great disaster. Under the whole heaven, nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
27:9:13:Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth.
27:9:14:The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.
27:9:15:Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong.
27:9:16:Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.
27:9:17:Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
27:9:18:Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.
27:9:19:Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name."
27:9:20:While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the Lord my God for the holy hill of my God,
27:9:21:While I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
27:9:22:He instructed me and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.
27:9:23:As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision:
27:9:24:"Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.
27:9:25:Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.
27:9:26:After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.
27:9:27:He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' In the middle of the 'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him."
27:10:1:In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true and concerned a great conflict. He understood the message, having received understanding in a vision.
27:10:2:In those days, I, Daniel, had been mourning for three weeks.
27:10:3:I ate no delicacies, nor did I consume any meat or wine, and I didn't anoint myself at all for the full three weeks.
27:10:4:On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is the Tigris,
27:10:5:I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of pure gold around his waist.
27:10:6:His body was like beryl, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs gleamed like polished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the roar of a multitude.
27:10:7:Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me didn't see it, but they were overcome with great terror and fled to hide themselves.
27:10:8:So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision. I lost my strength and my complexion became deathly pale, and I retained no energy.
27:10:9:Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I listened, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground.
27:10:10:But a hand touched me, setting me on my hands and knees, trembling.
27:10:11:He said to me, "Daniel, you are greatly loved. Understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have been sent to you." As he spoke these words, I stood up trembling.
27:10:12:He continued, "Don't be afraid, Daniel. From the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.
27:10:13:But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia.
27:10:14:Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision concerns a time yet to come."
27:10:15:While he was speaking these words to me, I bowed my face toward the ground and was speechless.
27:10:16:Then one who looked like a human touched my lips, and I opened my mouth to speak, saying to the one standing before me, "My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength.
27:10:17:How can I, your servant, speak with you, my lord? For now, I have no strength, and my breath has left me."
27:10:18:Again, the one who looked like a human touched me and gave me strength.
27:10:19:He said, "Don't be afraid, you who are highly esteemed. Peace be with you; be strong and courageous!" As he spoke to me, I regained my strength and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have given me strength."
27:10:20:Then he asked, "Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I must return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come.
27:10:21:However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth. No one supports me against these princes except Michael, your prince.
27:11:1:In the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to strengthen and protect him.
27:11:2:Now, I will reveal the truth to you. Three more kings will rise in Persia, followed by a fourth who will be far richer than the others. When he has gained power through his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
27:11:3:Then, a mighty king will appear who will rule with great authority and do as he pleases.
27:11:4:However, after he has risen, his kingdom will be broken apart and divided toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the same authority as his rule, for his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others.
27:11:5:The king of the South will grow strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger and will rule a vast dominion.
27:11:6:After some years, they will form an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will marry the king of the North to secure the agreement, but she will not retain her power, and neither will he. She, her husband, and those who supported her will all fall.
27:11:7:A member of her family line will take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North, enter his fortress, and emerge victorious.
27:11:8:He will also seize their gods, their precious articles of silver and gold, and carry them off to Egypt. For some time, he will refrain from attacking the king of the North.
27:11:9:The king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will return to his own land.
27:11:10:His sons will prepare for war, assembling a great army that will advance like a flood, reaching the fortress of the king of the South.
27:11:11:Enraged, the king of the South will march out to battle the king of the North, who will field a large army, but it will be defeated.
27:11:12:When the army is carried away, the king of the South will become arrogant and kill tens of thousands, yet he will not triumph.
27:11:13:The king of the North will again muster an army, larger than before, and after several years, he will advance with a great force and abundant supplies.
27:11:14:In those times, many will rise against the king of the South. Lawless ones among your people will join them in order to fulfill the vision, but they will ultimately fail.
27:11:15:The king of the North will come, build siege ramps, and capture a fortified city. The southern forces will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand.
27:11:16:The invader will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to oppose him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land, and it will fall under his control.
27:11:17:He will set his sights on capturing the entire kingdom of the South and make a treaty with the king of the South. In exchange for a daughter in marriage, he will hand over a portion of his territory, but the agreement will not last, and she will not remain on his side.
27:11:18:Next, he will turn his attention to the coastal lands and capture many, but a commander will put an end to his reproach and turn it back upon him.
27:11:19:After this, he will return to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble, fall, and be no more.
27:11:20:His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor, but in a short time, he will meet a violent end, not in battle or by public unrest.
27:11:21:A despicable person will arise to take the throne. He will not have the respect of royalty, but he will seize power through intrigue.
27:11:22:With overwhelming forces, he will sweep away everything before him, even breaking the power of the prince of the covenant.
27:11:23:After making alliances, he will act deceitfully and become strong with only a few supporters.
27:11:24:Without warning, he will invade the richest parts of the province and do what his predecessors never did, lavishing plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers.
27:11:25:He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army, and the king of the South will wage war with an equally large and powerful army, but he will not succeed because of plots devised against him.
27:11:26:Those who eat from the king's provisions will plot against him, causing his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will die in battle.
27:11:27:The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table, lying to each other, but their plans will come to nothing because the end is still to come at the appointed time.
27:11:28:The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action and then return to his own country.
27:11:29:At the appointed time, he will invade the South again, but this time, the outcome will be different than before.
27:11:30:Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant, showing favor to those who forsake it.
27:11:31:Armed forces sent by him will desecrate the temple fortress and abolish the daily sacrifice. They will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
27:11:32:With flattery, he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.
27:11:33:Wise leaders among them will instruct many, yet they will face persecution through sword, flame, captivity, and plunder for some time.
27:11:34:When they fall, they will receive a little help, but many who join them will do so with false motives.
27:11:35:Some of the wise will stumble, refining and purifying them until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
27:11:36:The king will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.
27:11:37:He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.
27:11:38:Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses—a god unknown to his ancestors—with gold, silver, precious stones, and costly gifts.
27:11:39:He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing land as a reward.
27:11:40:At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots, cavalry, and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood.
27:11:41:He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab, and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.
27:11:42:He will extend his power over many countries, including Egypt.
27:11:43:Egypt's treasures of gold and silver, along with her riches, will be taken by him, and Libya and Cush will follow in submission.
27:11:44:But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in great rage to destroy and annihilate many.
27:11:45:He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
27:12:1:At that time, Michael, the great protector who stands up for your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress unlike any other since nations first came into existence. But at that time, your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered.
27:12:2:Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken, some to everlasting life, and others to shame and everlasting contempt.
27:12:3:Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever.
27:12:4:But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end. Many will go here and there, and knowledge will increase."
27:12:5:Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river.
27:12:6:One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long until these astonishing events are fulfilled?"
27:12:7:The man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by the One who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been completely shattered, all these things will be finished."
27:12:8:I heard but did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will be the outcome of all this?"
27:12:9:He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
27:12:10:Many will be purified, made spotless, and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.
27:12:11:From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.
27:12:12:Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
27:12:13:As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days, you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."
