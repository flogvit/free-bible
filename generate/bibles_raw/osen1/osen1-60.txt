60:1:1:Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, sends greetings to God's chosen people living as exiles throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
60:1:2:God the Father knew you before time began, and by the Holy Spirit, He has set you apart for obedience to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with His blood. May grace and peace be yours in abundance.
60:1:3:Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In His great mercy, He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
60:1:4:We now have an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade—kept in heaven for you.
60:1:5:Through faith, you are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.
60:1:6:In this, you greatly rejoice, even though for a little while you may have to suffer various trials.
60:1:7:The purpose of these trials is to prove the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold. Your faith will result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
60:1:8:Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and even though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy.
60:1:9:For you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
60:1:10:Concerning this salvation, the prophets who spoke of the grace that was to come to you searched intently and with great care.
60:1:11:They tried to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
60:1:12:It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told to you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
60:1:13:So, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
60:1:14:As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
60:1:15:But just as He who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do.
60:1:16:For it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy."
60:1:17:Since you call on a Father who judges each person's work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.
60:1:18:You know that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold.
60:1:19:Instead, you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
60:1:20:He was chosen before the creation of the world but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
60:1:21:Through Him, you believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and glorified Him, so that your faith and hope are in God.
60:1:22:Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart.
60:1:23:For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.
60:1:24:For, "All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall."
60:1:25:But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.
60:2:1:So, rid yourselves of all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander.
60:2:2:Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may grow up in your salvation,
60:2:3:now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
60:2:4:As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him—
60:2:5:you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
60:2:6:For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame."
60:2:7:Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"
60:2:8:and, "A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.
60:2:9:But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
60:2:10:Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
60:2:11:Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.
60:2:12:Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
60:2:13:Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,
60:2:14:or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
60:2:15:For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
60:2:16:Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves.
60:2:17:Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.
60:2:18:Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
60:2:19:For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.
60:2:20:But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
60:2:21:To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
60:2:22:"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."
60:2:23:When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
60:2:24:"He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed."
60:2:25:For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
60:3:1:In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your husbands so that even if some do not believe in the Word, they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives.
60:3:2:As they observe your pure and respectful conduct,
60:3:3:Don't let your beauty come from outward adornments, such as braided hair or wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes.
60:3:4:Instead, let it be the inner beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God's sight.
60:3:5:For this is how the holy women of the past adorned themselves, putting their hope in God and being submissive to their husbands.
60:3:6:Just like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give in to fear.
60:3:7:Similarly, you husbands, live with your wives in an understanding manner, showing honor to the weaker female partner, as you are both heirs of the gracious gift of life. This will ensure that your prayers are not hindered.
60:3:8:Finally, all of you, be like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, and humble.
60:3:9:Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but instead, bless others because you were called to inherit a blessing.
60:3:10:For whoever desires to love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.
60:3:11:They must turn away from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.
60:3:12:For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
60:3:13:Who can harm you if you are eager to do good?
60:3:14:But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear their threats or be troubled,
60:3:15:Instead, sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being prepared to give a defense to anyone who asks you for the reason for the hope that is in you, but do so with gentleness and respect.
60:3:16:Keep a clear conscience, so that those who slander your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame by your honorable conduct.
60:3:17:It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
60:3:18:For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit.
60:3:19:In that state, he went and preached to the spirits in prison
60:3:20:Who disobeyed long ago when God patiently waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it, only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water.
60:3:21:This water symbolizes baptism, which now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
60:3:22:Who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.
60:4:1:Since Christ has suffered physically, you too should arm yourselves with the same mindset. For whoever suffers in the flesh is done with sin.
60:4:2:As a result, they can live the rest of their lives on earth not driven by human desires, but by the will of God.
60:4:3:You have spent enough time in the past doing what the ungodly desire—indulging in sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and detestable idolatry.
60:4:4:Now, your former companions may find it strange that you no longer join them in these reckless, wild pursuits, and they malign you.
60:4:5:But they will have to give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
60:4:6:This is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God's standards in regard to the spirit.
60:4:7:The end of all things is near. Therefore, be clear-minded and self-controlled, so you can pray effectively.
60:4:8:Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.
60:4:9:Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
60:4:10:Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.
60:4:11:If anyone speaks, they should do so as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in everything God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To Him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
60:4:12:Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
60:4:13:Instead, rejoice as you share in Christ's sufferings, so that you may also be overjoyed when His glory is revealed.
60:4:14:If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
60:4:15:Make sure none of you suffers as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a meddler.
60:4:16:However, if anyone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed, but glorify God in that name.
60:4:17:For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
60:4:18:And if it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
60:4:19:So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good. 
60:5:1:Now, as a fellow elder and witness of Christ's sufferings, I encourage the elders among you:
60:5:2:Care for God's flock that is under your watch, not because you have to, but willingly, as God desires; not for dishonest gain, but with eagerness.
60:5:3:Avoid being domineering over those entrusted to you, but rather serve as examples to the flock.
60:5:4:When the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive an unfading crown of glory.
60:5:5:Similarly, younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
60:5:6:Humble yourselves, then, under God's mighty hand, so that He may lift you up in due time.
60:5:7:Cast all your worries on Him, because He cares about you.
60:5:8:Stay alert and be watchful; your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
60:5:9:Stand firm against him, strong in your faith, knowing that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are experiencing the same kinds of suffering.
60:5:10:After you've suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
60:5:11:To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen.
60:5:12:Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, I've written to you briefly, encouraging and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
60:5:13:The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends greetings, as does Mark, my son.
60:5:14:Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
