14:1:1:Solomon, the son of David, strengthened his position as king over Israel, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
14:1:2:Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, including the commanders of thousands and hundreds, the judges, and all the leaders of Israel, along with the heads of families.
14:1:3:Together they went to the high place at Gibeon, for that was where the Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, could be found.
14:1:4:However, David had brought the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, after setting up a tent for it in Jerusalem.
14:1:5:The bronze altar made by Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, was also there before the Tabernacle of the LORD. Solomon and the assembly sought guidance from it.
14:1:6:Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the bronze altar in the presence of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon.
14:1:7:That night, God appeared to Solomon and said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
14:1:8:Solomon replied to God, "You have shown great kindness to my father David, and now you have allowed me to succeed him as king.
14:1:9:LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
14:1:10:Now grant me wisdom and knowledge, so I may lead this people effectively. For who can govern such a great people as yours?"
14:1:11:God answered Solomon, "Since this is what you desire, and you have not asked for wealth, possessions, or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and you have not even requested a long life, but instead have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,
14:1:12:therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions, and honor, such as no king before you has ever had, nor any after you will have."
14:1:13:So Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from the Tent of Meeting. He reigned over Israel from there.
14:1:14:Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14:1:15:The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
14:1:16:Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price.
14:1:17:They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
14:2:1:Solomon decided to build a temple for the Lord and a royal palace for himself.
14:2:2:He assigned 70,000 laborers, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to manage the work.
14:2:3:Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre, saying, "You have supplied my father David with cedar logs for his palace, and now I request your help again."
14:2:4:"I'm building a temple for the Lord my God, where we will burn fragrant incense, display the holy bread, and offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moons, and during appointed festivals. This is what Israel has been commanded to do."
14:2:5:"The temple I am building will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods."
14:2:6:"But who can really build a temple for Him, since even the highest heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I, then, that I should attempt to build a house for Him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?"
14:2:7:"Please send me a skilled craftsman who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as purple, crimson, and blue fabrics. He must also be experienced in engraving, so he can work alongside the craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided."
14:2:8:"Also, send me cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know your servants are skilled in cutting timber from there. My servants will work with your servants."
14:2:9:"I will provide you with plenty of food for your servants, since you'll be supplying me with so much timber. We'll need a lot of logs, because the temple I'm building will be large and magnificent."
14:2:10:King Hiram sent a letter to Solomon in response, saying, "Because the Lord loves His people, He has made you their king."
14:2:11:Hiram continued, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son with insight and understanding, who will build a temple for the Lord and a royal palace for himself."
14:2:12:Hiram also said, "I am sending you Huram-Abi, a skilled and talented craftsman, whose mother was from the tribe of Dan and whose father was from Tyre."
14:2:13:"He is trained to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, wood, purple, blue, and crimson fabrics, as well as fine linen. He is skilled in engraving and can create any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and those provided by your father David."
14:2:14:"Now let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine he promised for our servants."
14:2:15:Solomon provided Hiram with all the food he requested for his servants, and they exchanged resources, enabling Solomon to obtain timber and stones for the temple's construction.
14:3:1:Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David. This was the place David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
14:3:2:He started building on the second day of the second month during the fourth year of his reign.
14:3:3:The foundation Solomon laid for the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, according to the old standard measurements.
14:3:4:The entrance hall at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple, and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
14:3:5:He paneled the main hall with cypress wood and covered it with fine gold, decorated with palm trees and chains.
14:3:6:He adorned the temple with precious stones, and the gold he used was from Parvaim.
14:3:7:He also overlaid the temple's beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.
14:3:8:He made the Most Holy Place; its length was equal to the width of the temple, twenty cubits, and its width was also twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.
14:3:9:The weight of the nails used was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
14:3:10:In the Most Holy Place, he made two cherubim of sculptured work, and they were overlaid with gold.
14:3:11:The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the second cherub.
14:3:12:Similarly, one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple, and its other wing, also five cubits long, was in contact with the wing of the first cherub.
14:3:13:The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet facing the main hall.
14:3:14:He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson fabric and fine linen, and he worked cherubim into it.
14:3:15:In front of the temple, he made two pillars, each thirty-five cubits high, with a capital on top measuring five cubits.
14:3:16:He made interwoven chains for the capitals on top of the pillars and made a hundred pomegranates, which he attached to the chains.
14:3:17:He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left. The one on the right he named Jakin, and the one on the left he named Boaz.
14:4:1:Solomon made a bronze altar, 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high.
14:4:2:He also created a molten sea, 10 cubits in diameter, 5 cubits high, and with a circumference of 30 cubits.
14:4:3:Under the sea, there were sculptures of bulls encircling it, with 10 bulls per cubit for a total of 300 bulls; they were cast in two rows when the sea was cast.
14:4:4:The sea stood on twelve bronze bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were inward.
14:4:5:The thickness of the sea was a handbreadth, and its brim was shaped like the edge of a cup, resembling a lily blossom; it held 3,000 baths.
14:4:6:Solomon also made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north side; they used them to rinse items for burnt offerings, but the priests washed themselves in the sea.
14:4:7:He crafted ten golden lampstands according to their design and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
14:4:8:Additionally, Solomon made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He also crafted 100 golden bowls.
14:4:9:Next, he built the courtyard for the priests and the large court along with doors for the court; he overlaid the doors with bronze.
14:4:10:Furthermore, he positioned the sea on the southeast corner of the temple.
14:4:11:Huram-abi crafted pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed the work King Solomon had assigned him for the house of God:
14:4:12:the two pillars; the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the two pillars; the two sets of network covering the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars;
14:4:13:the 400 pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates per network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
14:4:14:the stands with their basins;
14:4:15:the sea and the twelve bulls beneath it;
14:4:16:as well as the pots, shovels, forks, and all related utensils. All these items that Huram-abi made for King Solomon were crafted from polished bronze for the house of the Lord.
14:4:17:King Solomon had all these articles cast in the plain of the Jordan, in clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
14:4:18:Solomon produced so many of these items that they did not weigh the bronze used; its weight was beyond measure.
14:4:19:Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of God: the golden altar; the tables on which to place the showbread;
14:4:20:the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold, to burn before the inner sanctuary according to the prescribed manner;
14:4:21:the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold, of purest gold;
14:4:22:the snuffers, basins, dishes, and censers of pure gold; and the entrance doors of the innermost part of the house, the Holy of Holies, as well as the doors of the main hall of the temple, all overlaid with gold.
14:5:1:So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was completed. Then he brought in the items his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings—and placed them in the treasuries of God's temple.
14:5:2:At that time, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the chiefs of the families of the Israelites in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the City of David, which is Zion.
14:5:3:All the men of Israel came together to the king during the festival in the seventh month.
14:5:4:When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites picked up the ark,
14:5:5:and they carried the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. The priests who were Levites transported them.
14:5:6:King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who had gathered around him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be counted or numbered.
14:5:7:The priests then brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
14:5:8:The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, covering the ark and its carrying poles.
14:5:9:The poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside; and they are there to this day.
14:5:10:There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
14:5:11:When the priests came out of the Holy Place, all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—were standing on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
14:5:12:The trumpet players and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the LORD. They raised their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments, singing: "For He is good; His faithful love endures forever." Then a cloud filled the temple of the LORD,
14:5:13:so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
14:6:1:Then Solomon said, "The LORD has chosen to dwell in thick darkness.
14:6:2:Now I have built a magnificent temple for You, a place for You to reside forever."
14:6:3:The king turned around and blessed the entire assembly of Israel while they all stood.
14:6:4:He said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with His own hands has fulfilled what He promised with His own mouth to my father David. For He said,
14:6:5:'Since the day I brought My people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel to build a house so that My Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to lead My people Israel.
14:6:6:But now I have chosen Jerusalem for My Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule My people Israel.'
14:6:7:"My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14:6:8:But the LORD said to my father David, 'You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for My Name.
14:6:9:Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for My Name.'
14:6:10:The LORD has kept the promise He made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14:6:11:There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that He made with the people of Israel."
14:6:12:Solomon then stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
14:6:13:Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
14:6:14:He said, "LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth—You who keep Your covenant and show unfailing love to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.
14:6:15:You have kept Your promise to Your servant David my father; with Your mouth You have promised and with Your hand You have fulfilled it—as it is today.
14:6:16:"Now, LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father the promises You made to him when You said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before Me according to My law, as you have done.'
14:6:17:And now, LORD, God of Israel, let Your word that You promised Your servant David come true.
14:6:18:"But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain You. How much less this temple I have built!
14:6:19:Yet, LORD my God, give attention to Your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy. Hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying in Your presence.
14:6:20:May Your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which You said You would put Your Name there. May You hear the prayer Your servant prays toward this place.
14:6:21:Hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, Your dwelling place; and when You hear, forgive.
14:6:22:"When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before Your altar in this temple,
14:6:23:then hear from heaven and act. Judge between Your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on their own head what they have done, and vindicate the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence.
14:6:24:"When Your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against You, and when they turn back and give praise to Your Name, praying and making supplication before You in this temple,
14:6:25:then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel and bring them back to the land You gave to them and their ancestors.
14:6:26:"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to Your Name and turn from their sin because You have afflicted them,
14:6:27:then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land You gave Your people for an inheritance.
14:6:28:"When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
14:6:29:and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among Your people Israel—being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out their hands toward this temple—
14:6:30:then hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since You know their hearts (for You alone know the human heart),
14:6:31:so that they will fear You and walk in obedience to You all the time they live in the land You gave our ancestors.
14:6:32:"As for the foreigner who does not belong to Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your great Name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this temple,
14:6:33:then hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of You, so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your Name and fear You, as do Your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears Your Name.
14:6:34:"When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to You toward this city You have chosen and the temple I have built for Your Name,
14:6:35:then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
14:6:36:"When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near;
14:6:37:and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with You in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly';
14:6:38:and if they turn back to You with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land You gave their ancestors, toward the city You have chosen and toward the temple I have built for Your Name,
14:6:39:then from heaven, Your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
14:6:40:"Now, my God, may Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
14:6:41:Now arise, LORD God, and come to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might. May Your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and may Your faithful people rejoice in Your goodness.
14:6:42:LORD God, do not reject Your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David Your servant."
14:7:1:When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
14:7:2:The priests couldn't enter the Lord's temple because the glory of the Lord filled it.
14:7:3:When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, worshiping and giving thanks to the Lord, saying, "He is good; His love endures forever."
14:7:4:Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.
14:7:5:King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
14:7:6:The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the Lord that King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord—for his steadfast love endures forever—whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.
14:7:7:Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat portions.
14:7:8:So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him—a very great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
14:7:9:On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.
14:7:10:On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things the Lord had done for David, for Solomon, and for his people Israel.
14:7:11:Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king's house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house he successfully accomplished.
14:7:12:Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
14:7:13:When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,
14:7:14:if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
14:7:15:Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
14:7:16:I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
14:7:17:As for you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, doing all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,
14:7:18:then I will establish your royal throne, as I made covenant with your father David, saying, 'You shall never lack a successor to rule over Israel.'
14:7:19:But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,
14:7:20:then I will uproot Israel from the land I have given them, and I will cast out of my sight this temple that I have consecrated for my name. I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
14:7:21:And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, 'Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this house?'
14:7:22:Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors who brought them out of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them; that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'"
14:8:1:In the twentieth year after Solomon became king of Israel, he began to rebuild the towns that Hiram had given him and settled Israelites in them.
14:8:2:Solomon then went to Hamath-zobah and conquered it.
14:8:3:He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.
14:8:4:He constructed Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
14:8:5:and rebuilt Baalath and other storage cities that belonged to him.
14:8:6:He also built up all the chariot cities, the cavalry cities, and everything else Solomon desired to construct in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.
14:8:7:As for all the people who were left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (who were not Israelites),
14:8:8:their descendants who remained in the land after them, those whom the Israelites could not completely destroy, Solomon conscripted as forced laborers until this very day.
14:8:9:But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites; they served as his soldiers, officers, commanders, captains, chariot warriors, and cavalry.
14:8:10:These were the chief officers in charge of Solomon's projects—550 officials supervising the men who did the work.
14:8:11:Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David, king of Israel, because the places where the ark of the Lord has entered are holy."
14:8:12:Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord he had built in front of the portico,
14:8:13:according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual festivals—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles.
14:8:14:In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to the daily requirement, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for this was what David, the man of God, had ordered.
14:8:15:They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests or the Levites regarding any matter or concerning the treasuries.
14:8:16:All of Solomon's work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid until its completion. So the temple of the Lord was finished.
14:8:17:Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
14:8:18:And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers and manned by experienced sailors. They sailed together with Solomon's men to Ophir and brought back 450 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
14:9:1:Queen Sheba heard about Solomon's fame, so she came to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She arrived with a large group of attendants, camels carrying spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she met Solomon, she talked with him about everything that was on her mind.
14:9:2:Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain.
14:9:3:When Queen Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, his palace, the food at his table, his officials' living quarters, the attendance of his servants, their clothing, and his cupbearers, as well as the burnt offerings he made at the house of the Lord, she was left breathless.
14:9:4:She told Solomon, "The reports I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom are true.
14:9:5:But I didn't believe it until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half of it was told to me; your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report I heard.
14:9:6:How fortunate your people must be! How blessed your officials who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
14:9:7:Praise be to the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king for the Lord your God. Because of your God's love for Israel and his desire to establish them forever, he has made you king over them to maintain justice and righteousness."
14:9:8:Then she gave King Solomon 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such an abundance of spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
14:9:9:The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algumwood and precious stones.
14:9:10:The king used the algumwood to make steps for the house of the Lord and the royal palace, as well as harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like this had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.
14:9:11:King Solomon gave Queen Sheba all she desired and asked for, even more than she had brought to him. Then she and her attendants returned to their own country.
14:9:12:Solomon's yearly income was 666 talents of gold,
14:9:13:not including revenue from merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
14:9:14:King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.
14:9:15:He also made 300 small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
14:9:16:Moreover, the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
14:9:17:The throne had six steps, and there was a footstool of gold attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside them.
14:9:18:Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom.
14:9:19:All of King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Silver was considered worthless in Solomon's time.
14:9:20:For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Hiram's servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
14:9:21:King Solomon became greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
14:9:22:All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
14:9:23:Year after year, visitors brought their gifts: articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
14:9:24:Solomon accumulated 4,000 stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horsemen. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14:9:25:He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
14:9:26:Solomon also built up a large force of chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with the king in Jerusalem.
14:9:27:The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
14:9:28:Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.
14:9:29:As for the other events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat.
14:9:30:Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
14:9:31:Then Solomon rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
14:10:1:Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gathered there to make him king.
14:10:2:When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon.
14:10:3:The people of Israel sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to speak with Rehoboam, saying:
14:10:4:"Your father made our yoke heavy; now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
14:10:5:Rehoboam replied, "Come back to me in three days." So the people left.
14:10:6:King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, "How do you advise me to respond to these people?"
14:10:7:They said, "If you are kind to these people and please them by speaking kindly, they will be your servants forever."
14:10:8:But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders and instead consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisors.
14:10:9:He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who say, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
14:10:10:The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy; make it lighter for us,' this: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.'
14:10:11:Now, my father laid a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"
14:10:12:Three days later, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as he had instructed them.
14:10:13:The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,
14:10:14:he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
14:10:15:So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
14:10:16:When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king, "What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So all Israel went home.
14:10:17:But Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
14:10:18:King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
14:10:19:So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
14:11:1:When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 chosen warriors—to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
14:11:2:But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
14:11:3:"Tell Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
14:11:4:'This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers. Let every man return home, for this thing is from Me.'" So they listened to the Lord's words and stopped their advance against Jeroboam.
14:11:5:Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah.
14:11:6:He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
14:11:7:Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,
14:11:8:Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
14:11:9:Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
14:11:10:Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
14:11:11:He strengthened the fortresses and placed commanders in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine.
14:11:12:He equipped each fortress with shields and spears, making them very strong. Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to him.
14:11:13:The priests and Levites from all the regions of Israel sided with Rehoboam when they saw that Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them.
14:11:14:Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places, goat-demons, and calf idols he had made.
14:11:15:Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the Lord, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:11:16:They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam, son of Solomon, for three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time.
14:11:17:Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and Abihail, daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.
14:11:18:She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
14:11:19:After her, he married Maakah, daughter of Absalom. She bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
14:11:20:Rehoboam loved Maakah, daughter of Absalom, more than all his other wives and concubines. He had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters.
14:11:21:Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maakah, as chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king.
14:11:22:He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities. He provided them with abundant provisions and sought many wives for them.
14:12:1:When Rehoboam had established his rule and become strong, he and all Israel abandoned the law of the Lord.
14:12:2:As a result, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem because they had been unfaithful to the Lord.
14:12:3:He came with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and countless troops from Egypt, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians.
14:12:4:Shishak captured the fortified cities of Judah and advanced as far as Jerusalem.
14:12:5:Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, "This is what the Lord says: 'You have abandoned me, so I have abandoned you into the hands of Shishak.'"
14:12:6:The leaders of Israel and King Rehoboam humbled themselves and said, "The Lord is just."
14:12:7:When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah: "Because they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will grant them some deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
14:12:8:However, they will become his subjects, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands."
14:12:9:Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made.
14:12:10:To replace them, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and assigned them to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
14:12:11:Whenever the king went to the Lord's temple, the guards would carry the shields and then return them to the guardroom.
14:12:12:Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the Lord's anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.
14:12:13:King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his Name there. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
14:12:14:Rehoboam did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the Lord.
14:12:15:The events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies. There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
14:12:16:Rehoboam passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah succeeded him as king.
14:13:1:In the 18th year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began his reign over Judah.
14:13:2:He ruled for three years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam during this time.
14:13:3:Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 skilled warriors, while Jeroboam drew up a formation of 800,000 skilled fighters.
14:13:4:Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and said, "Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
14:13:5:Don't you know that the Lord God of Israel has given the kingship over Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
14:13:6:Yet Jeroboam, son of Nebat, servant of Solomon, rebelled against his lord.
14:13:7:Worthless men gathered around him, scoundrels who were too strong for Rehoboam, Solomon's son, when he was young and inexperienced, unable to stand up to them.
14:13:8:Now you think you can defeat the kingdom of the Lord, which is led by the descendants of David, just because you have a large army and those golden calves that Jeroboam made as your gods.
14:13:9:You drove out the priests of the Lord, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests, just like the people of other lands do. Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods.
14:13:10:But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not abandoned Him. The priests who serve the Lord are descendants of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.
14:13:11:Every morning and evening they burn offerings to the Lord, along with fragrant incense. They also set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are following the instructions of the Lord our God, but you have abandoned Him.
14:13:12:Now look, God is with us as our leader, and His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed."
14:13:13:Meanwhile, Jeroboam had sent troops around to ambush them from the rear. So while his main army was in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them.
14:13:14:When the people of Judah realized that they were being attacked from both front and rear, they cried out to the Lord. The priests blew their trumpets,
14:13:15:and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. As they raised the battle cry, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
14:13:16:The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.
14:13:17:Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them; 500,000 of Israel's best men fell dead.
14:13:18:So the people of Israel were humbled on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:13:19:Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some of his towns, including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their surrounding villages.
14:13:20:Jeroboam never regained his power during Abijah's reign, and the Lord struck him down, and he died.
14:13:21:But Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and had 22 sons and 16 daughters.
14:13:22:The rest of the events of Abijah's reign, including his words and deeds, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo.
14:14:1:Asa became king after Abijah, and during his reign, the land experienced peace for ten years.
14:14:2:Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, removing the foreign altars and idols, and breaking down the sacred pillars and Asherah poles.
14:14:3:He commanded the people of Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to obey His laws and commands.
14:14:4:He removed the high places and incense altars from every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under his rule.
14:14:5:Asa built strong cities throughout Judah since the land had no war and the Lord had given him rest.
14:14:6:He told the people of Judah, "Let's build these towns and surround them with walls, towers, gates, and bars, for we have sought the Lord our God, and He has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.
14:14:7:Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, armed with small shields and bows. All were brave warriors.
14:14:8:Zerah the Ethiopian came against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and advanced as far as Mareshah.
14:14:9:Asa went out to meet him, and they took their positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
14:14:10:Asa called out to the Lord his God, saying, "Lord, there is no one like You to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O Lord our God, for we rely on You, and in Your name we have come against this vast army. O Lord, You are our God; do not let mere humans prevail against You."
14:14:11:Then the Lord struck down the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
14:14:12:Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar, and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the Lord and His forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.
14:14:13:They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the Lord had fallen on them. They looted all these villages since there was much plunder there.
14:14:14:They also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off many sheep, goats, and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
14:15:1:In the spirit of God, Azariah son of Oded came to Asa,
14:15:2:and said, "Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin, listen up! The Lord is with you when you're with him. If you seek him, you'll find him; but if you abandon him, he'll abandon you.
14:15:3:For a long time, Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.
14:15:4:But in their distress, they turned to the Lord, the God of Israel, and sought him out; and he let them find him.
14:15:5:In those times, there was no peace for anyone going about their daily tasks, because many disturbances plagued the inhabitants of the lands.
14:15:6:Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God had troubled them with every kind of adversity.
14:15:7:But you, be strong and don't give up, for your work will be rewarded."
14:15:8:When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage, removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He also repaired the altar of the Lord that stood in front of the temple porch.
14:15:9:He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them (for many had defected to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him).
14:15:10:They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
14:15:11:At that time, they sacrificed to the Lord 700 head of cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.
14:15:12:They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul.
14:15:13:All who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
14:15:14:With loud voices, they swore an oath to the Lord, and they shouted with joy. They also sounded trumpets and horns.
14:15:15:All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They eagerly sought God, and he was found by them. So the Lord gave them rest on every side.
14:15:16:King Asa even deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut it down, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
14:15:17:Although the high places were not removed from Israel, Asa's heart remained fully committed to the Lord throughout his life.
14:15:18:He brought into the temple of God the silver, gold, and articles that he and his father had dedicated.
14:15:19:There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
14:16:1:In the thirty-sixth year of King Asa's reign, King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from coming in or going out to King Asa of Judah.
14:16:2:Asa responded by taking silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's temple and his own palace, and sent it to King Ben-Hadad of Aram who lived in Damascus, saying,
14:16:3:"Let's make an agreement between us, just as our fathers did. Look, I have sent you silver and gold; now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will withdraw from attacking me."
14:16:4:Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent his army commanders against the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
14:16:5:When Baasha heard about this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work on it.
14:16:6:King Asa then ordered all the people of Judah to carry away the stones and timber Baasha had used to fortify Ramah, and they used them to build Geba and Mizpah.
14:16:7:At that time, the seer Hanani came to King Asa of Judah and said, "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
14:16:8:Weren't the Ethiopians and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the Lord, He delivered them into your hand.
14:16:9:For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."
14:16:10:Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison because he was so enraged by this message. Asa also mistreated some of the people at that time.
14:16:11:The events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14:16:12:In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was afflicted with a severe disease in his feet. Yet even in his illness, he did not seek help from the Lord but only from physicians.
14:16:13:Finally, Asa passed away in the forty-first year of his reign.
14:16:14:He was buried in the tomb he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier filled with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.
14:17:1: Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, began to rule as king over Judah and he strengthened himself against Israel.
14:17:2: He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set up garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
14:17:3: The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David and did not worship Baal.
14:17:4: Instead, he sought the God of his father, obeyed His commandments, and did not behave like the people of Israel.
14:17:5: As a result, the LORD established the kingdom under his control, and all of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, making him rich and highly respected.
14:17:6: Jehoshaphat's heart took delight in the ways of the LORD, and he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
14:17:7: In the third year of his reign, he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.
14:17:8: They were accompanied by Levites named Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, as well as priests Elishama and Jehoram.
14:17:9: These men taught the people throughout Judah, carrying with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went around to all the towns of Judah, educating the people.
14:17:10: The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms surrounding Judah, so they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat.
14:17:11: Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, while the Arabs brought him flocks of 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
14:17:12: Jehoshaphat grew more powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.
14:17:13: He stored large amounts of supplies in the towns of Judah and stationed experienced warriors in Jerusalem.
14:17:14: These are the numbers of their leaders according to their families: Adnah was the commander of 300,000 brave soldiers from Judah.
14:17:15: Next in command was Jehohanan, who commanded 280,000 men.
14:17:16: After him was Amasiah son of Zichri, who had volunteered himself for the LORD's service, with 200,000 mighty warriors.
14:17:17: From Benjamin, there was Eliada, a valiant soldier, commanding 200,000 archers equipped with shields and bows.
14:17:18: Lastly, Jehozabad commanded 180,000 armed men.
14:17:19: These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
14:18:1:Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, had great wealth and honor, and he formed an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, through marriage.
14:18:2:After some years, Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and his people, encouraging Jehoshaphat to join him in attacking Ramoth Gilead.
14:18:3:Ahab, king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you; my people are your people, and my horses are your horses."
14:18:4:But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First, let's seek the counsel of the Lord."
14:18:5:So the king of Israel gathered 400 prophets and asked them, "Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should I refrain?" They answered, "Go, for God will give it into the hand of the king."
14:18:6:However, Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the Lord here whom we can ask?"
14:18:7:The king of Israel replied, "There is one man, Micaiah son of Imlah, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad." Jehoshaphat responded, "Don't say that."
14:18:8:So the king of Israel called an officer and ordered him to bring Micaiah quickly.
14:18:9:Meanwhile, the kings of Israel and Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying before them.
14:18:10:Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and declared, "This is what the Lord says: 'With these, you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"
14:18:11:All the other prophets agreed, saying, "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king."
14:18:12:The messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, all the prophets are predicting success for the king. Be sure to agree with them and predict success."
14:18:13:But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, I can only say what my God tells me to say."
14:18:14:When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should I refrain?" Micaiah answered, "Go and be successful, for they will be given into your hands."
14:18:15:But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
14:18:16:Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"
14:18:17:The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, only bad?"
14:18:18:Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and left.
14:18:19:The Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab, king of Israel, to attack Ramoth Gilead and fall?' One suggested this, and another that.
14:18:20:Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.' 'By what means?' the Lord asked.
14:18:21:'I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' the spirit said. 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'
14:18:22:So now, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you."
14:18:23:Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.
14:18:24:Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."
14:18:25:The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son.
14:18:26:Say, 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and give him only bread and water until I return safely.'"
14:18:27:Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"
14:18:28:So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went up to Ramoth Gilead.
14:18:29:The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
14:18:30:The king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
14:18:31:When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel!" So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him. God drew them away from him.
14:18:32:When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
14:18:33:But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."
14:18:34:The battle raged on that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset, he died.
14:19:1: Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem.
14:19:2: The prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said, "King Jehoshaphat, should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this, the Lord's wrath is upon you.
14:19:3: However, there is some good in you. You have removed the idols from the land and have set your heart on seeking God."
14:19:4: Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, bringing them back to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:19:5: He appointed judges throughout the land in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
14:19:6: He told the judges, "Be careful in what you do, for you are not judging for man but for the Lord, who will be with you when you render judgment.
14:19:7: Now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; be diligent and act justly, for our God does not tolerate injustice, partiality, or bribery."
14:19:8: In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat also appointed some Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to serve as judges for cases involving the Lord and disputes between residents.
14:19:9: He instructed them, saying, "You must always act in the fear of the Lord, faithfully and wholeheartedly.
14:19:10: Whenever a case comes to you from your fellow citizens living in their cities—whether bloodshed or other matters of law, commandments, statutes, or judgments—you are to warn them not to sin against the Lord, so that his wrath will not come upon you and your fellow citizens. Do this, and you will not sin.
14:19:11: Amariah, the chief priest, will be over you in all cases involving the Lord, and Zebadiah, son of Ishmael, leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in all cases involving the king. The Levites will serve as officers for you. Be strong and act with courage; may the Lord be with those who do what is right."
14:20:1:After this, the Moabites and Ammonites, along with some of the Meunites, came to wage war against Jehoshaphat.
14:20:2:News reached Jehoshaphat that a vast army was approaching from beyond the Dead Sea. They were already in Hazazon Tamar, also known as En Gedi.
14:20:3:Fearful, Jehoshaphat turned to the Lord for guidance and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
14:20:4:The people of Judah gathered to seek help from the Lord; they came from every town in Judah to pray.
14:20:5:In the assembly at the temple of the Lord, Jehoshaphat stood among the people and prayed:
14:20:6:"O Lord, God of our ancestors, are you not the God in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in your hand is power and might, so that no one can stand against you.
14:20:7:Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
14:20:8:They have lived here and built a sanctuary for your name, saying,
14:20:9:'If calamity comes upon us—whether by sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this temple and before you, for your name is in this temple. We will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear and save us.'
14:20:10:Now, here are the Ammonites, Moabites, and Meunites who you did not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt. Instead, they turned away from them and did not destroy them.
14:20:11:See how they repay us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
14:20:12:Our God, will you not judge them? For we are powerless against this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."
14:20:13:All the people of Judah, including their wives and children, stood before the Lord.
14:20:14:Then, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, son of Zechariah, who was a Levite from the clan of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.
14:20:15:He said, "Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat! This is what the Lord says to you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army, for the battle is not yours but God's.
14:20:16:Tomorrow, march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
14:20:17:You will not need to fight this battle. Take your positions, stand firm, and see the deliverance the Lord will give you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you.'"
14:20:18:Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord.
14:20:19:The Levites from the Kohathite and Korahite clans stood up and praised the Lord, the God of Israel, with very loud voices.
14:20:20:Early in the morning, they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful."
14:20:21:After consulting with the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying, "Give thanks to the Lord, for his love endures forever."
14:20:22:As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the Ammonites, Moabites, and Meunites who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.
14:20:23:The Ammonites and Moabites turned on the Meunites and annihilated them. Then, they destroyed one another.
14:20:24:When the people of Judah arrived at their lookout point in the desert, they saw the vast army lying dead on the ground; no one had escaped.
14:20:25:Jehoshaphat and his people went to gather the plunder, finding a vast amount of equipment, clothing, and valuable items. They collected so much that it took them three days to carry it all away.
14:20:26:On the fourth day, they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they praised the Lord. That is why it is called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
14:20:27:Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem joyfully returned to Jerusalem, for the Lord had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies.
14:20:28:They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the Lord with harps, lyres, and trumpets.
14:20:29:The fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands when they heard how the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.
14:20:30:And so, the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest on every side.
14:21:1:Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jehoram became king in his place.
14:21:2:Jehoram had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel.
14:21:3:Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable items, along with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
14:21:4:When Jehoram took over his father's kingdom, he strengthened his position by killing all his brothers and some of the officials of Israel.
14:21:5:Jehoram was 32 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for eight years in Jerusalem.
14:21:6:He followed the wicked ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, because he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the sight of the Lord.
14:21:7:Nevertheless, the Lord was unwilling to destroy the house of David because of the covenant he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and his descendants forever.
14:21:8:During Jehoram's reign, Edom revolted against Judah's control and set up their own king.
14:21:9:So Jehoram went out with his officers and all his chariots to suppress the revolt. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he managed to break through at night.
14:21:10:Edom has been in rebellion against Judah ever since. At the same time, Libnah also revolted because Jehoram had abandoned the Lord, the God of his ancestors.
14:21:11:Jehoram also built high places in the hills of Judah, leading the people of Jerusalem into idolatry and turning Judah away from God.
14:21:12:A letter came to Jehoram from the prophet Elijah, which said: "This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: 'You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or Asa, king of Judah.
14:21:13:Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel and led Judah and the people of Jerusalem into idolatry, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your father's house, who were better than you.
14:21:14:The Lord will bring a great disaster upon your people, your children, your wives, and everything you have.
14:21:15:And you yourself will suffer from a severe intestinal disease until it causes your bowels to come out.'"
14:21:16:The Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
14:21:17:They attacked Judah, invaded it, and carried off all the possessions found in the king's palace, along with his sons and wives. Only his youngest son, Ahaziah, was left.
14:21:18:After all this, the Lord struck Jehoram with an incurable disease of the intestines.
14:21:19:As time went on, at the end of two years, his intestines came out because of the disease, and he died in terrible agony. His people did not make a funeral fire for him like they had done for his predecessors.
14:21:20:Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. No one mourned his death; they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14:22:1:Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, began to rule over Judah in Jerusalem when he was 42 years old. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.
14:22:2:Ahaziah followed the wicked ways of Ahab's family, because his mother advised him to do evil.
14:22:3:He acted sinfully like Ahab's family, provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger, just as his father had done before him.
14:22:4:Ahaziah allied himself with Joram, Ahab's son, joining him in battle against Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram there.
14:22:5:Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the injuries he received in battle. Meanwhile, Ahaziah, son of Jehoram and grandson of Judah's King Jehoshaphat, went to visit Joram in Jezreel because he was sick.
14:22:6:God used this visit to bring about Ahaziah's downfall. When he arrived, he joined Joram in fighting against Jehu, whom the Lord had appointed to destroy Ahab's family.
14:22:7:As Jehu executed judgment on Ahab's family, he found the leaders of Judah and Ahaziah's relatives who were serving Ahaziah and killed them as well.
14:22:8:When Jehu searched for Ahaziah, he captured him hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, who put him to death. They buried him, for they said, "He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart." So no one from Ahaziah's family was strong enough to rule the kingdom.
14:22:9:When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she set out to destroy the entire royal family of Judah.
14:22:10:However, Jehosheba, King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, took Joash, Ahaziah's son, and hid him from Athaliah, so she could not kill him.
14:22:11:Jehosheba placed Joash and his nurse in a bedroom, hiding them from Athaliah. In this way, he was not killed.
14:22:12:Joash remained hidden with his aunt Jehosheba in God's temple for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
14:23:1:In the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered his courage and made a pact with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
14:23:2:They traveled throughout Judah, gathering the Levites from all the cities and the heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
14:23:3:The whole assembly made a covenant with the king in God's temple. Jehoiada said to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the Lord promised concerning David's descendants.
14:23:4:Now this is what you must do: one-third of you priests and Levites who are on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the doors,
14:23:5:another third shall be at the royal palace, and the remaining third at the Foundation Gate; while all the other people will stay in the courtyards of the Lord's temple.
14:23:6:No one is to enter the Lord's temple except the priests and those Levites who serve; they may enter because they are holy, but all the other people must observe the Lord's command.
14:23:7:The Levites will surround the king, each with a weapon in hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be killed. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."
14:23:8:The Levites and all the people of Judah did as Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each brought his men—those who were on duty on the Sabbath and those who were off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
14:23:9:Jehoiada the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears, large and small shields that had belonged to King David and were in God's temple.
14:23:10:He stationed all the people, each with a weapon in hand, from the south side of the temple to the north side, surrounding the altar and the temple, to protect the king on every side.
14:23:11:Then they brought out the king's son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of the covenant. They proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, saying, "Long live the king!"
14:23:12:When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went to them at the Lord's temple.
14:23:13:She looked, and there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The commanders and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, while the singers with musical instruments led the praise. Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
14:23:14:Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds who were in charge of the troops and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death in the Lord's temple."
14:23:15:So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.
14:23:16:Jehoiada then made a covenant that he, the people, and the king would be the Lord's people.
14:23:17:All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed its altars and idols, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
14:23:18:Jehoiada placed the responsibility for the Lord's temple on the Levitical priests, whom David had assigned to it, and they offered burnt offerings to the Lord as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.
14:23:19:He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the Lord's temple so that no one who was impure in any way could enter.
14:23:20:He took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the Lord's temple. They entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate, and seated the king on the royal throne.
14:23:21:All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was calm because Athaliah had been put to death by the sword.
14:24:1:Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, from the city of Beersheba.
14:24:2:Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.
14:24:3:Jehoiada found two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
14:24:4:Later on, Joash decided to restore the temple of the Lord.
14:24:5:He gathered the priests and Levites together and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the temple of your God as needed year by year, and do it quickly." However, the Levites did not act quickly.
14:24:6:So the king summoned Jehoiada, who was the chief priest, and asked him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in the tax imposed by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?"
14:24:7:For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God and used the sacred things of the Lord's temple for the Baals.
14:24:8:At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside the gate of the temple of the Lord.
14:24:9:A proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the Lord the tax that Moses, the servant of God, had required of Israel in the wilderness.
14:24:10:All the leaders and people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put them into the chest until it was full.
14:24:11:Whenever the chest was brought to the royal officials by the Levites, and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would empty the chest and then return it to its place. This happened regularly, and they collected a significant sum.
14:24:12:The king and Jehoiada used this money to hire workmen who repaired the temple of the Lord.
14:24:13:The workmen restored the temple to its original design and reinforced it.
14:24:14:When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to make articles for the Lord's temple, including items used for the burnt offerings, dishes, and other instruments of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the Lord.
14:24:15:Jehoiada grew old and full of years, and he died at the age of 130.
14:24:16:He was buried with the kings in the City of David because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.
14:24:17:After Jehoiada's death, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.
14:24:18:They abandoned the temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.
14:24:19:God sent prophets to bring the people back to him and to warn them, but they would not listen.
14:24:20:Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah, son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says: 'Why do you disobey the Lord's commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the Lord, he has forsaken you.'"
14:24:21:But they conspired against him and stoned him to death at the king's command in the courtyard of the Lord's temple.
14:24:22:King Joash did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him but killed his son. As Zechariah died, he said, "May the Lord see this and call you to account."
14:24:23:At the end of the year, the Aramean army attacked Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, killed all the leaders of the people, and sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
14:24:24:The Aramean army came with only a small number of men, but the Lord delivered a much larger army into their hands because Judah had forsaken the Lord, the God of their ancestors. So they executed judgment on Joash.
14:24:25:When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His own officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14:24:26:Those who conspired against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabite woman.
14:24:27:The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
14:25:1: Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.
14:25:2: He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a wholehearted commitment.
14:25:3: As soon as his rule was firmly established, he executed the officials who had murdered his father, the king.
14:25:4: However, he did not put their children to death, in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded: "Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children be put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin."
14:25:5: Amaziah gathered the people of Judah and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then counted those twenty years old or more and found there were 300,000 men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.
14:25:6: He also hired a hundred thousand skilled warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
14:25:7: But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, these troops from Israel must not go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—not with any of the people of Ephraim.
14:25:8: Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow."
14:25:9: Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The Lord can give you much more than that."
14:25:10: So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in great anger.
14:25:11: Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.
14:25:12: The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff, and threw them down so that they were all dashed to pieces.
14:25:13: Meanwhile, the soldiers that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to join him in battle raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
14:25:14: When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them, and offered sacrifices to them.
14:25:15: The Lord's anger burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why have you sought after the gods of these people, when they could not save their own people from your hand?"
14:25:16: While the prophet was still speaking, Amaziah said to him, "Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" The prophet stopped but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."
14:25:17: After taking counsel, Amaziah king of Judah sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, let's face each other in battle."
14:25:18: But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
14:25:19: You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. Stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"
14:25:20: Amaziah, however, would not listen, for it was God's will that he should fall into the hands of Israel so that he might be punished for seeking the gods of Edom.
14:25:21: So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
14:25:22: Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
14:25:23: Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about six hundred feet long.
14:25:24: He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that were in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and hostages, and then returned to Samaria.
14:25:25: Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
14:25:26: As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
14:25:27: From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
14:25:28: He was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah.
14:26:1:Uzziah, who was 16 years old when he became king, ruled for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.
14:26:2:He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the example set by his father Amaziah.
14:26:3:Uzziah sought God during the time of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord, God made him successful.
14:26:4:He fought against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines.
14:26:5:God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabians living in Gur Baal, and the Meunites.
14:26:6:His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly assisted by the Lord until he became very powerful.
14:26:7:Uzziah constructed towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and fortified them.
14:26:8:He also built towers in the desert and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains. He also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.
14:26:9:Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as recorded by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officials.
14:26:10:The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.
14:26:11:Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.
14:26:12:Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows, and slingstones for the entire army.
14:26:13:He also built skillfully designed devices in Jerusalem to shoot arrows and catapult large stones from the towers and corners of the walls. His fame spread even further because of his extraordinary accomplishments.
14:26:14:However, when he became strong, his heart grew proud, leading to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense.
14:26:15:Azariah the priest, along with eighty other courageous priests, confronted King Uzziah.
14:26:16:They said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is the responsibility of the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; you will not be honored by the Lord God."
14:26:17:Angered, Uzziah had a censer in his hand to burn incense. As he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the Lord, beside the altar of incense.
14:26:18:When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead. They hurried him out, and he himself was eager to leave because the Lord had afflicted him.
14:26:19:King Uzziah had leprosy until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, afflicted with leprosy, and was excluded from the temple of the Lord. Jotham, his son, was in charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
14:26:20:The other events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.
14:26:21:Uzziah rested with his ancestors and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings, for the people said, "He had leprosy." And Jotham, his son, succeeded him as king.
14:27:1:In the time of King Uzziah's son Jotham, he took over the throne at the age of twenty-five and ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. His mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
14:27:2:Jotham did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following in the footsteps of his father Uzziah, but he did not enter the temple of the Lord. The people, however, continued to act corruptly.
14:27:3:He built the Upper Gate of the Lord's temple and did extensive work on the wall of Ophel.
14:27:4:Moreover, he constructed cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and watchtowers in the forests.
14:27:5:Jotham also went to war against the Ammonites' king, defeating them. That year, the Ammonites paid him one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand measures of barley. They repeated these payments in the second and third years.
14:27:6:Jotham grew strong because he was determined to live in obedience to the Lord his God.
14:27:7:The other events of Jotham's reign, including his wars and accomplishments, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14:27:8:He was twenty-five when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
14:27:9:When Jotham passed away, he was buried in the City of David, and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king.
14:28:1:Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. He didn't do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, unlike his ancestor David.
14:28:2:Instead, he followed the ways of the kings of Israel and made idols for the worship of Baal.
14:28:3:He burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and even sacrificed his own children in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations that the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
14:28:4:Furthermore, he offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
14:28:5:Because of his unfaithfulness, the Lord his God allowed the king of Aram to defeat Ahaz and take many prisoners back to Damascus. The Lord also handed him over to the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.
14:28:6:In a single day, Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah because they had abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:28:7:Zichri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second only to the king.
14:28:8:The Israelites took captive 200,000 people from their brothers and sisters in Judah, including women, sons, and daughters. They also seized a great deal of plunder and brought it all back to Samaria.
14:28:9:But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when they returned to Samaria. He said to them, "The Lord, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah and let you defeat them, but you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.
14:28:10:Now you plan to enslave the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Aren't you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God?
14:28:11:Listen to me! Send back the captives you've taken from your relatives, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you."
14:28:12:Some leaders of the Ephraimites—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—confronted those returning from the battle.
14:28:13:They said, "Don't bring the captives here, for we already have enough guilt before the Lord. You intend to add more to our sins and guilt, which is too great for us to bear!"
14:28:14:So the soldiers released the captives and handed over the plunder to the leaders and the assembly.
14:28:15:Then the men designated by name took charge of the captives, clothed all who were naked with clothes from the plunder, gave them food and drink, bandaged their wounds, and put all the weak on donkeys. They brought them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho, the City of Palms, and then returned to Samaria.
14:28:16:At that time, King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
14:28:17:The Edomites had come again, attacked Judah, and carried away captives.
14:28:18:The Philistines also raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages.
14:28:19:The Lord humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel, who had encouraged moral decline in Judah and was unfaithful to the Lord.
14:28:20:Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria attacked Ahaz but didn't support him.
14:28:21:Although Ahaz plundered the Lord's temple and the treasuries of the royal palace to pay the king of Assyria, it didn't help him.
14:28:22:In his time of trouble, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord.
14:28:23:He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, reasoning, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they led to his downfall and that of all Israel.
14:28:24:Ahaz gathered together the articles of the temple of God, cut them into pieces, and shut the doors of the Lord's temple. He set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
14:28:25:In every town of Judah, he built high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking the Lord, the God of his ancestors, to anger.
14:28:26:The other events of Ahaz's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14:28:27:Ahaz died and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he wasn't placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.
14:29:1:Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
14:29:2:He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the example set by his ancestor David.
14:29:3:In the first month of his reign, Hezekiah reopened the doors of the temple of the Lord and repaired them.
14:29:4:He summoned the priests and Levites, gathered them together in the square on the east side,
14:29:5:and said to them, "Listen to me, you Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the Lord, the God of your ancestors. Remove all the defilement from the sanctuary.
14:29:6:Our ancestors were unfaithful and did evil in the eyes of the Lord our God. They abandoned him, turned their faces away from the Lord's dwelling place, and turned their backs on him.
14:29:7:They also closed the doors of the temple, put out the lamps, and did not burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
14:29:8:That is why the Lord's anger has come upon Judah and Jerusalem. He has made them an object of dread, horror, and ridicule, as you can see with your own eyes.
14:29:9:Because of this, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, daughters, and wives are in captivity.
14:29:10:Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
14:29:11:My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister to him and to burn incense."
14:29:12:Then the Levites set to work. From the Kohathites: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites: Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites: Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;
14:29:13:from the descendants of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14:29:14:from the descendants of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and from the descendants of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.
14:29:15:These men gathered their fellow Levites together and consecrated themselves. Then they went in to purify the temple of the Lord, as the king had ordered, following the word of the Lord.
14:29:16:The priests entered the temple of the Lord to purify it, and they brought out all the unclean things they found there into the courtyard. The Levites took them and carried them outside to the Kidron Valley.
14:29:17:They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they had reached the portico of the Lord. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the Lord itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
14:29:18:Then they went to King Hezekiah and reported, "We have purified the entire temple of the Lord, including the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for the bread of the Presence with all its utensils.
14:29:19:We have also prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed during his reign when he was unfaithful. They are now in front of the Lord's altar."
14:29:20:Early the next morning, King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went up to the temple of the Lord.
14:29:21:They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the Lord.
14:29:22:So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.
14:29:23:The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
14:29:24:The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
14:29:25:He stationed the Levites in the temple of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. This command came from the Lord through his prophets.
14:29:26:The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
14:29:27:Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the Lord also began, accompanied by the trumpets and the instruments of David, king of Israel.
14:29:28:The whole assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed.
14:29:29:When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.
14:29:30:King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy and bowed their heads and worshiped.
14:29:31:Then Hezekiah said, "Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the Lord." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing brought burnt offerings.
14:29:32:The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord.
14:29:33:The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.
14:29:34:The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
14:29:35:There were also many burnt offerings, along with the fat of the fellowship offerings and drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the Lord was reestablished.
14:29:36:Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.
14:30:1:Hezekiah sent messages throughout all Israel and Judah, inviting them to come to the temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the Lord, the God of Israel.
14:30:2:The king, his officials, and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
14:30:3:They were unable to observe it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people hadn't gathered in Jerusalem.
14:30:4:The plan seemed right to both the king and the whole assembly.
14:30:5:So they decided to issue a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the Lord, the God of Israel, since it had not been observed by many as prescribed.
14:30:6:Couriers went with letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah, delivering the king's message, which said: "People of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may return to you who remain, who have escaped the grasp of the kings of Assyria.
14:30:7:Don't be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, leading him to punish them severely, as you can see.
14:30:8:Now, don't be stubborn like your ancestors. Submit to the Lord, come to his sanctuary which he has made holy forever, and serve the Lord your God so that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
14:30:9:If you return to the Lord, your fellow Israelites and children will find compassion from their captors and return to this land. The Lord your God is gracious and merciful; he will not turn his face away from you if you return to him."
14:30:10:The couriers traveled from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people laughed at them and mocked them.
14:30:11:Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
14:30:12:Also, the hand of God was on Judah, giving them one heart to follow the king's command and the words of the Lord.
14:30:13:A large crowd gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly.
14:30:14:They rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem. They also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
14:30:15:Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves, bringing burnt offerings to the temple of the Lord.
14:30:16:They took their customary positions, as prescribed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood received from the Levites.
14:30:17:Since many in the congregation had not consecrated themselves, the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and couldn't consecrate their lambs to the Lord.
14:30:18:Although most of the people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves, they still ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the Lord, who is good, pardon everyone
14:30:19:who sets their heart on seeking God—the Lord, the God of their ancestors—even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."
14:30:20:The Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
14:30:21:The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the Lord every day, accompanied by loud instruments dedicated to the Lord.
14:30:22:Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good understanding of the service of the Lord. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion, offered fellowship offerings, and confessed their sins to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:30:23:The whole assembly then decided to celebrate the festival for another seven days, so they joyfully continued for another week.
14:30:24:King Hezekiah of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, while the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. A large number of priests consec rated themselves.
14:30:25:The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests, Levites, and all who had come from the land of Israel, including the foreigners who had come to celebrate from Israel and those living in Judah.
14:30:26:There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in the city.
14:30:27:Then the priests and Levites stood up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, as their prayer reached heaven, the holy dwelling place of the Lord.
14:31:1:After all these events, Hezekiah and all the people of Israel celebrated the Passover in Jerusalem. They removed the idols and cleansed the city.
14:31:2:Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to their divisions, each according to their role in serving God and offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, and to give thanks and praise at the gates of the Lord's dwelling.
14:31:3:The king contributed a portion of his possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings, as well as for the burnt offerings on Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed festivals, as written in the Law of the Lord.
14:31:4:Hezekiah commanded the people living in Jerusalem to provide for the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the Lord.
14:31:5:As soon as the order was given, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and all the produce of the field. They brought a large amount, a tithe of everything.
14:31:6:The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought tithes of cattle and sheep, and a tithe of dedicated things consecrated to the Lord their God. They piled them up in heaps.
14:31:7:They began piling up the heaps in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
14:31:8:When Hezekiah and his officials saw the heaps, they praised the Lord and blessed his people Israel.
14:31:9:Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps,
14:31:10:and Azariah, the chief priest from the family of Zadok, answered, "Since the people started bringing their contributions to the temple of the Lord, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the Lord has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over."
14:31:11:Hezekiah then ordered storerooms to be prepared in the temple of the Lord, and when they were ready,
14:31:12:they brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts. Conaniah, a Levite, was put in charge, and his brother Shimei was his assistant.
14:31:13:The supervisors under them were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief official in the temple of God.
14:31:14:Kore son of Imnah, the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the Lord and also the consecrated gifts.
14:31:15:Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the cities of the priests, making distributions to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.
14:31:16:In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records—all who would enter the temple of the Lord to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
14:31:17:They distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
14:31:18:They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.
14:31:19:As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.
14:31:20:This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God.
14:31:21:In everything that he undertook in the service of God's temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
14:32:1:After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself.
14:32:2:When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come with the purpose of attacking Jerusalem,
14:32:3:he consulted with his officers and military leaders about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they supported him in this decision.
14:32:4:A large force was assembled, and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water?" they said.
14:32:5:Hezekiah worked hard, reinforcing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He also constructed another wall outside that one and strengthened the supporting terraces of the City of David. Furthermore, he made a large number of weapons and shields.
14:32:6:He appointed military officers over the people and gathered them together in the square at the city gate. He encouraged them, saying,
14:32:7:"Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.
14:32:8:With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.
14:32:9:Later, while Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were besieging Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and all the people of Judah who were there:
14:32:10:"This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
14:32:11:Isn't Hezekiah misleading you when he says, 'The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria'? He's the very one who removed the high places and altars, telling Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it.'
14:32:12:Don't you know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my power?
14:32:13:Who among all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my power?
14:32:14:Now don't let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Don't believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my power!"
14:32:15:His officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
14:32:16:The king also wrote letters ridiculing the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."
14:32:17:They called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, trying to terrify and discourage them, so they could capture the city.
14:32:18:They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world—the work of human hands.
14:32:19:But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.
14:32:20:And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.
14:32:21:So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.
14:32:22:Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on, he was highly regarded by all the nations.
14:32:23:In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.
14:32:24:But Hezekiah's heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD's wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
14:32:25:Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; so the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.
14:32:26:Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables.
14:32:27:He also constructed buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine, and olive oil; and he made stalls for various types of cattle, and pens for the flocks.
14:32:28:He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.
14:32:29:It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.
14:32:30:But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.
14:32:31:The other events of Hezekiah's reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
14:32:32:Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
14:33:1:Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
14:33:2:He did evil in the sight of the Lord, following the detestable practices of the nations that the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
14:33:3:He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed, set up altars to the Baals, made Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the starry hosts.
14:33:4:In the Lord's temple, where God had said His name would be, Manasseh built altars to all the starry hosts.
14:33:5:He placed these altars in both courtyards of the Lord's temple.
14:33:6:He sacrificed his own children in fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the Lord's sight, provoking Him to anger.
14:33:7:Manasseh even carved an idol and put it in God's temple, which God had told David and Solomon: "In this temple and in Jerusalem, I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel; I will establish My Name forever."
14:33:8:If the Israelites carefully follow all the commands and laws given through Moses, I will not make them leave the land I gave their ancestors.
14:33:9:But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray, causing them to do more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
14:33:10:The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they ignored His warnings.
14:33:11:So the Lord brought the commanders of the Assyrian army against them. They captured Manasseh, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
14:33:12:In his distress, Manasseh sought the Lord's favor and humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.
14:33:13:When he prayed to Him, God was moved by his plea and listened to his request. He allowed Manasseh to return to Jerusalem and rule his kingdom again. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.
14:33:14:After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of Gihon spring in the valley, extending it to the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel. He also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
14:33:15:He removed the foreign gods and idols from the Lord's temple, as well as the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem. He threw them outside the city.
14:33:16:Then he restored the altar of the Lord, sacrificed fellowship offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it, and told the people of Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel.
14:33:17:The people continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the Lord their God.
14:33:18:The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words spoken to him by seers in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
14:33:19:His prayer and how God received his plea, as well as all his sins, unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself, are written in the records of the seers.
14:33:20:Manasseh passed away and was buried with his ancestors. His son Amon succeeded him as king.
14:33:21:Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled for two years in Jerusalem.
14:33:22:He did evil in the Lord's sight, just like his father Manasseh. He worshiped and bowed down to all the idols his father had made.
14:33:23:But unlike his father, Amon did not humble himself before the Lord; instead, he increased his guilt.
14:33:24:Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
14:33:25:The people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
14:34:1:Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he ruled for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
14:34:2:He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, following the example of his ancestor David, not turning away from it.
14:34:3:In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year, he started to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, Asherah poles, carved idols, and cast images.
14:34:4:They tore down the altars of Baals in his presence; he chopped down the incense altars that stood above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images into pieces, then ground them into dust and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
14:34:5:He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, cleansing Judah and Jerusalem.
14:34:6:In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, he destroyed all the altars and Asherah poles.
14:34:7:When he had demolished the altars and Asherah poles, crushed the idols to powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
14:34:8:In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the Lord his God.
14:34:9:They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who guarded the doors had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim, and the rest of Israel, as well as from all Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14:34:10:They entrusted the money to the workers who had oversight of the Lord's temple, and they in turn paid the workers who were repairing and restoring the temple.
14:34:11:They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, timber for joists, and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into disrepair.
14:34:12:The workers labored faithfully, supervised by Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descendants of Kohath. The Levites—all skilled musicians—
14:34:13:were in charge of carrying the heavy loads and supervising all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were also secretaries, officials, and gatekeepers.
14:34:14:While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been given through Moses.
14:34:15:Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord." He gave it to Shaphan.
14:34:16:Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported, "Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.
14:34:17:They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."
14:34:18:Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
14:34:19:When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes.
14:34:20:The king gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's attendant:
14:34:21:"Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lord's anger that is poured out on us because our ancestors did not obey the word of the Lord by doing everything written in this book."
14:34:22:Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.
14:34:23:She said to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
14:34:24:This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people—all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.
14:34:25:Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made, my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'
14:34:26:But tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:
14:34:27:Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your clothes and wept in my presence, I have heard you,' declares the Lord.
14:34:28:'Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.
14:34:29:Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
14:34:30:He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord.
14:34:31:The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes, and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.
14:34:32:Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
14:34:33:Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he made all who were present in Israel serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived, they did not fail to follow the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
14:35:1:Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
14:35:2:He appointed the priests to their duties, encouraging them to serve in the house of the Lord.
14:35:3:To the Levites who taught all Israel and were consecrated to the Lord, he said, "Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon, son of David, king of Israel. You no longer need to carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel."
14:35:4:Prepare yourselves according to your families, following the instructions given by King David of Israel and his son Solomon.
14:35:5:Stand in the sanctuary, serving as representatives for the family divisions of your fellow Israelites, the laypeople.
14:35:6:Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites, following the word of the Lord through Moses.
14:35:7:Josiah contributed a total of 30,000 lambs and goats, plus 3,000 bulls from his own possessions, as Passover offerings for the people.
14:35:8:His officials also willingly gave to the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders of the house of God, provided the priests with 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 bulls.
14:35:9:Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, donated 5,000 lambs and 500 bulls to the Levites for Passover offerings.
14:35:10:The preparations were completed, and the priests stood in their assigned places, while the Levites were organized by their divisions, as the king had ordered.
14:35:11:They slaughtered the Passover lambs, and the priests splashed the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.
14:35:12:They set aside the burnt offerings so that they could be distributed according to the family divisions of the people to be offered to the Lord, as written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the bulls.
14:35:13:They roasted the Passover lambs over the fire as prescribed, and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, cauldrons, and pans, quickly serving them to the people.
14:35:14:Afterward, the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, because the priests were busy offering burnt offerings and fat until nightfall. So the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
14:35:15:The musicians, sons of Asaph, were in their positions following the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts because their fellow Levites prepared their portions for them.
14:35:16:So everything was done that day for the service of the Lord's house, as the Passover celebration and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, according to King Josiah's command.
14:35:17:The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, along with the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
14:35:18:No Passover like this one had been celebrated in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel. None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover like the one Josiah celebrated with the priests, the Levites, all the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14:35:19:This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
14:35:20:After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.
14:35:21:But Necho sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, king of Judah? I have not come against you today but am fighting another nation. God has told me to hurry, so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."
14:35:22:However, Josiah would not turn away from him but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He did not listen to Necho's words from the mouth of God but went to fight on the plain of Megiddo
14:35:23:In the battle, archers shot King Josiah, and he told his servants, "Take me away, for I am severely wounded."
14:35:24:His servants took him out of his chariot, placed him in his other chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
14:35:25:Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day, all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Book of Laments.
14:35:26:The other events of Josiah's reign, along with his acts of devotion according to what is written in the Law of the Lord,
14:35:27:and his earlier and later accomplishments, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14:36:1:Zedekiah was 21 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.
14:36:2:He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the Lord.
14:36:3:The people of Judah and Jerusalem rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, which led to their downfall.
14:36:4:Furthermore, King Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear allegiance by God. He stubbornly refused to turn back to the Lord, the God of Israel.
14:36:5:The leaders of the priests and the people also followed suit, continually committing unfaithful acts and defiling the house of the Lord, which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.
14:36:6:Despite the repeated warnings from the Lord's messengers, they mocked His words and scorned His prophets until the wrath of the Lord rose against His people, and there was no remedy.
14:36:7:So the Lord brought the king of Babylon against them, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and showed no compassion to young or old, man or woman.
14:36:8:Nebuchadnezzar took all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, as well as the treasures of the Lord's temple, the king's possessions, and those of the officials, and carried them off to Babylon.
14:36:9:He burned the temple of God, tore down the walls of Jerusalem, set fire to all its palaces, and destroyed everything of value.
14:36:10:Those who survived the sword were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his descendants until the rise of the Persian kingdom.
14:36:11:This fulfilled the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah, that the land would lie desolate for seventy years to make up for its unobserved Sabbaths.
14:36:12:In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, the Lord stirred his spirit to fulfill the prophecy of Jeremiah, so he issued a proclamation throughout his kingdom and put it in writing:
14:36:13:"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build a temple for Him at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you belongs to His people, may the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.'"
