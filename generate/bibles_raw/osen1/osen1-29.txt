29:1:1:Hear this, everyone! The Lord has a message for you. Elders, pay attention to what I'm about to say.
29:1:2:Has anything like this ever happened during your lifetime, or even in the days of your ancestors?
29:1:3:Tell your children about it, and let them tell their children, and their children to the next generation.
29:1:4:What the cutting locust left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten; and what the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten.
29:1:5:Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you wine drinkers, because the sweet wine has been taken away from your mouths.
29:1:6:A powerful and countless army is invading my land. They have the teeth of a lion and the fangs of a lioness.
29:1:7:They've destroyed my vines and ruined my fig trees, stripping their bark and leaving them white and bare.
29:1:8:Mourn like a young woman dressed in sackcloth, grieving for the husband of her youth.
29:1:9:The grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the Lord. The priests mourn, those who serve the Lord.
29:1:10:The fields are devastated, the ground mourns; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails.
29:1:11:Be dismayed, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is lost.
29:1:12:The vine is dried up, and the fig tree withers; the pomegranate, the palm, and the apple tree— all the trees of the field are dried up. Surely, joy has withered away from the people.
29:1:13:Put on sackcloth and lament, you priests; wail, you who serve at the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, because the offerings of grain and drink are withheld from the house of your God.
29:1:14:Declare a holy fast; call for a solemn assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord.
29:1:15:Alas for the day! The day of the Lord is near, and it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
29:1:16:Isn't our food being cut off right before our eyes, along with joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29:1:17:The seeds shrivel under their clods, the storehouses are desolate, the granaries are torn down, for the grain has dried up.
29:1:18:How the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
29:1:19:To you, O Lord, I cry out, for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.
29:1:20:Even the wild animals cry out to you, for the watercourses have dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
29:2:1:Listen up, everyone in the land! Pay attention, all inhabitants of Zion! The LORD has a message for you. A day of darkness and gloom is coming, a day of clouds and thick darkness.
29:2:2:Like the dawn spreading across the mountains, a great and mighty army approaches; nothing like it has ever been seen before, nor will it be seen again in the years to come.
29:2:3:Before them, fire devours; behind them, flames consume. The land in front of them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it's a desolate wasteland; nothing escapes their destruction.
29:2:4:Their appearance resembles horses, and they gallop like cavalry.
29:2:5:With a rumble like chariots on mountain tops, they leap forward, crackling like a blazing fire consuming stubble, like a powerful army ready for battle.
29:2:6:Nations tremble at their presence; every face turns pale.
29:2:7:They charge like warriors, scaling walls like soldiers. Each one marches in line, never breaking rank.
29:2:8:They don't jostle one another; each moves in its path. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
29:2:9:They rush upon the city, running along the wall; they climb into houses, entering through windows like thieves.
29:2:10:Before them, the earth quakes and the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars lose their brightness.
29:2:11:The LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond counting, and mighty are those who obey his command. The day of the LORD is indeed great and very dreadful; who can endure it?
29:2:12:But even now, declares the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
29:2:13:Rend your hearts, not your garments, and turn back to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.
29:2:14:Who knows? He may turn and relent, leaving behind a blessing—grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God.
29:2:15:Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly.
29:2:16:Gather the people, consecrate the congregation; assemble the elders, gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.
29:2:17:Between the temple porch and the altar, let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep and say, "Spare your people, LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"
29:2:18:Then the LORD will be zealous for his land and take pity on his people.
29:2:19:The LORD will reply to them, "I am sending you grain, new wine, and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.
29:2:20:I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land; its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea. And its stench will rise; its foul smell will fill the air."
29:2:21:Do not fear, O land; rejoice and be glad, for the LORD has done great things.
29:2:22:Do not be afraid, wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.
29:2:23:Rejoice, people of Zion, and be glad in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
29:2:24:The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
29:2:25:I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten—the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm—my great army that I sent among you.
29:2:26:You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.
29:2:27:Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed.
29:2:28:Afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
29:2:29:Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
29:2:30:I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
29:2:31:The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.
29:2:32:And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, even among the survivors whom the LORD calls.
29:3:1:In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29:3:2:I will gather all nations together and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There, I will put them on trial for their treatment of my people, my heritage Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, dividing up my land.
29:3:3:They cast lots for my people, trading boys for prostitutes and selling girls for wine to drink.
29:3:4:Now, what have you against me, Tyre, Sidon, and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something? If you are trying to get even with me, I will swiftly and speedily return your actions upon your own heads.
29:3:5:You have taken my silver and gold, carrying off my finest treasures to your temples.
29:3:6:You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, sending them far from their homeland.
29:3:7:See, I am going to rouse them from the places to which you sold them, and I will return your actions upon your own heads.
29:3:8:I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation." Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
29:3:9:Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.
29:3:10:Turn your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, "I am strong!"
29:3:11:Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather together there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD!
29:3:12:Let the nations be roused and advance to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
29:3:13:Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!
29:3:14:Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
29:3:15:The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will no longer shine.
29:3:16:The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
29:3:17:Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her.
29:3:18:In that day, the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the Valley of Acacias.
29:3:19:But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.
29:3:20:Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.
29:3:21:I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwells in Zion.
