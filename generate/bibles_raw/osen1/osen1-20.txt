20:1:1:The purpose of these proverbs is to teach wisdom and discipline, as well as to help people understand wise sayings.
20:1:2:Through these proverbs, you'll learn to live with prudence and gain insight into what is right, just, and fair.
20:1:3:These teachings will provide instruction to the inexperienced and knowledge to the young.
20:1:4:Let the wise listen and increase their learning, and let those with understanding receive guidance.
20:1:5:By exploring these proverbs, one can understand riddles, parables, and the words of the wise, as well as their hidden meanings.
20:1:6:Respect for the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
20:1:7:Hear, my child, your father's instruction, and don't neglect your mother's teaching.
20:1:8:For they will be a graceful garland on your head and a necklace adorning your neck.
20:1:9:My child, if sinners try to entice you, do not give in.
20:1:10:If they say, "Join us, let's lie in wait for blood, let's ambush the innocent without cause,"
20:1:11:"We'll swallow them alive like the grave, whole, like those descending into the pit,"
20:1:12:"We'll find all kinds of precious wealth, and fill our houses with plunder,"
20:1:13:"Throw in your lot with us, and we'll share the loot together,"
20:1:14:My child, do not walk with them or set foot on their path.
20:1:15:Stay away from their path, for it leads to harm, and protect your life by avoiding their ways.
20:1:16:For they run to do evil and are eager to shed blood.
20:1:17:It's futile to spread a net in full view of the birds,
20:1:18:But these people lie in wait for their own blood, and set an ambush for their own lives.
20:1:19:Such is the fate of all who pursue ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who possess it.
20:1:20:Wisdom calls out in the streets; she raises her voice in the public squares.
20:1:21:She cries out at the busiest intersections, and at the entrance to the city gates she speaks her words:
20:1:22:"How long, you simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?
20:1:23:Turn to my rebuke, and I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.
20:1:24:But since you refuse to listen when I call, and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
20:1:25:Because you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke,
20:1:26:I, in turn, will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you,
20:1:27:When calamity comes like a storm, and your disaster arrives like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
20:1:28:Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
20:1:29:For they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord.
20:1:30:They would have none of my counsel, and despised all my correction.
20:1:31:Therefore, they will eat the fruit of their own way and be filled with the consequences of their choices.
20:1:32:For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
20:1:33:But whoever listens to me will live securely and be at ease, without fear of harm."
20:2:1:My child, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,
20:2:2:Turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding;
20:2:3:Indeed, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,
20:2:4:If you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,
20:2:5:Then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.
20:2:6:For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20:2:7:He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
20:2:8:For he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.
20:2:9:Then you will understand what is right and just and fairâ€”every good path.
20:2:10:For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
20:2:11:Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.
20:2:12:Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,
20:2:13:Who have left the straight paths to walk in dark ways,
20:2:14:Who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
20:2:15:Whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.
20:2:16:It will also save you from the adulterous woman, from the wayward woman with her seductive words,
20:2:17:Who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.
20:2:18:For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
20:2:19:None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.
20:2:20:Thus you will walk in the ways of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20:2:21:For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
20:2:22:But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
20:3:1:My child, don't forget my teachings, but let your heart keep my commandments.
20:3:2:For they will add length to your days, years to your life, and peace to your soul.
20:3:3:Let love and faithfulness never leave you; tie them around your neck, write them on your heart's tablet.
20:3:4:In this way, you'll find favor and good understanding in the eyes of both God and people.
20:3:5:Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and don't rely solely on your own understanding.
20:3:6:In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.
20:3:7:Don't be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
20:3:8:This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.
20:3:9:Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest.
20:3:10:Then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.
20:3:11:My child, do not despise the Lord's discipline or resent His rebuke.
20:3:12:For the Lord disciplines those He loves, just as a father corrects the child he delights in.
20:3:13:Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gains understanding.
20:3:14:For wisdom's profit is better than silver, and her gain is more valuable than gold.
20:3:15:She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare to her.
20:3:16:Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20:3:17:Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
20:3:18:She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold on to her will be happy.
20:3:19:By wisdom, the Lord laid the earth's foundations; by understanding, He set the heavens in place.
20:3:20:By His knowledge, the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.
20:3:21:My child, don't lose sight of these things; preserve sound judgment and discernment.
20:3:22:They will be life for you, an adornment to grace your neck.
20:3:23:Then you'll walk securely on your path, and your foot won't stumble.
20:3:24:When you lie down, you won't be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.
20:3:25:Don't fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
20:3:26:For the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.
20:3:27:Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it's within your power to act.
20:3:28:Don't say to your neighbor, "Go away and come back later; I'll give it tomorrow," when you have it with you.
20:3:29:Don't plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.
20:3:30:Don't accuse anyone without cause, when they've done you no harm.
20:3:31:Don't envy the violent or choose any of their ways.
20:3:32:For the Lord detests the perverse but takes the upright into His confidence.
20:3:33:The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.
20:3:34:He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.
20:3:35:The wise will inherit honor, but fools get only shame.
20:4:1:Listen, my children, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.
20:4:2:I give you sound advice, so don't abandon my teachings.
20:4:3:When I was a child with my father, tender and cherished by my mother,
20:4:4:he taught me and said, "Let your heart hold on to my words; obey my commands, and you will live.
20:4:5:Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn away from them.
20:4:6:Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.
20:4:7:The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.
20:4:8:Cherish her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.
20:4:9:She will give you a beautiful crown; she will present you with a glorious garland."
20:4:10:Hear, my child, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.
20:4:11:I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.
20:4:12:When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; when you run, you will not stumble.
20:4:13:Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.
20:4:14:Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evildoers.
20:4:15:Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.
20:4:16:For they cannot rest unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.
20:4:17:They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20:4:18:The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
20:4:19:But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.
20:4:20:My child, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words.
20:4:21:Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;
20:4:22:for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.
20:4:23:Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.
20:4:24:Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
20:4:25:Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.
20:4:26:Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.
20:4:27:Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.
20:5:1:Listen carefully, my child, to my wisdom; pay attention to my understanding.
20:5:2:This will help you make good decisions and guide your speech with knowledge.
20:5:3:The lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her words are smoother than oil.
20:5:4:But in the end, she is bitter like wormwood and sharp as a double-edged sword.
20:5:5:Her steps lead to death, and her paths take you nowhere good.
20:5:6:She doesn't think about the path of life; her ways are unstable, and she doesn't even realize it.
20:5:7:So now, my children, listen to me, and don't stray from the words of my mouth.
20:5:8:Keep far away from her, and don't go near the door of her house.
20:5:9:Otherwise, you'll give your honor to others and your years to someone cruel.
20:5:10:Strangers will consume your wealth, and your hard work will benefit someone else's house.
20:5:11:In the end, you will groan with regret when your body and health are gone.
20:5:12:You'll say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart despised correction!"
20:5:13:I didn't listen to my teachers or pay attention to those who tried to guide me.
20:5:14:Now I'm on the brink of ruin, and everyone can see my shame.
20:5:15:Drink water from your own well, and let the streams flow from your own fountain.
20:5:16:Don't let your springs overflow into the streets; keep them for yourself alone.
20:5:17:Let them be yours, and not for sharing with strangers.
20:5:18:May your marriage be blessed, and may you rejoice with the wife of your youth.
20:5:19:She is a loving deer, a graceful doe; let her affection fill you always, and delight in her love forever.
20:5:20:Why, my child, would you be captivated by an immoral woman or embrace the breast of an adulteress?
20:5:21:For the Lord sees all that we do, and he examines our every path.
20:5:22:The wicked are trapped by their own sins, ensnared by the ropes of their guilt.
20:5:23:They will die because they refuse discipline, and they'll be lost due to their own foolishness.
20:6:1:My child, if you've become a guarantor for your neighbor or have shaken hands in agreement with a stranger,
20:6:2:You've trapped yourself with the words of your mouth; you're caught by your own words.
20:6:3:So do this, my child, to free yourself, since you've fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
20:6:4:Don't allow sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
20:6:5:Escape like a gazelle from the hunter's hand, or like a bird from the fowler's snare.
20:6:6:Consider the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and become wise.
20:6:7:Without a leader, officer, or ruler,
20:6:8:The ant prepares its food in summer and gathers its provisions during harvest.
20:6:9:How long will you lie there, lazy one? When will you get up from your sleep?
20:6:10:A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
20:6:11:And poverty will come upon you like a robber, and scarcity like an armed man.
20:6:12:A troublemaker and a villain is the one who goes around with a dishonest mouth,
20:6:13:Who winks with their eye, signals with their foot, and points with their finger.
20:6:14:With deceit in their heart, they plot evil; they constantly stir up conflict.
20:6:15:Therefore, sudden disaster will overtake them; in an instant, they'll be shattered beyond recovery.
20:6:16:There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to Him:
20:6:17:Proud eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
20:6:18:A heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,
20:6:19:A false witness who pours out lies, and a person who stirs up conflict among friends.
20:6:20:My child, keep your father's commandment and don't forsake your mother's teaching.
20:6:21:Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.
20:6:22:When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will speak to you.
20:6:23:For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is a light; the corrective discipline of instruction is the way to life,
20:6:24:Keeping you from the immoral woman, and from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
20:6:25:Don't lust after her beauty in your heart or let her captivate you with her eyes.
20:6:26:For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but another man's wife preys on your very life.
20:6:27:Can a man scoop fire into his lap without burning his clothes?
20:6:28:Or can someone walk on hot coals without scorching their feet?
20:6:29:So it is with the one who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20:6:30:People don't despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he's starving.
20:6:31:Yet if caught, he must repay sevenfold; he may have to give up all the wealth of his house.
20:6:32:But a man who commits adultery has no sense; whoever does so destroys himself.
20:6:33:He will find wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
20:6:34:For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20:6:35:He won't accept any compensation; he'll refuse even a bribe, no matter how great.
20:7:1:Listen, my child, to the words I say; keep my commandments and you will live.
20:7:2:Hold on to wisdom as if she were your closest friend; embrace understanding like a beloved family member.
20:7:3:They will protect you from the seductive woman, from the smooth talk of an unfaithful partner.
20:7:4:As I looked out my window, I saw some naive young people among the crowd.
20:7:5:One of them, in particular, was lacking in understanding, wandering through the streets near her corner.
20:7:6:He walked down the road leading to her house, as twilight turned into darkness.
20:7:7:Then, suddenly, there she was! A woman dressed seductively, with cunning intentions.
20:7:8:She is loud and defiant, always restless and never content at home.
20:7:9:Now in the streets, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner, waiting for her next victim.
20:7:10:She grabbed him and kissed him boldly, and with a brazen face she said:
20:7:11:"I had to offer peace offerings; today I've fulfilled my vows.
20:7:12:So, I came out to meet you, to search for you, and I found you!
20:7:13:I have covered my bed with colorful linens from Egypt.
20:7:14:I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20:7:15:Come, let's enjoy each other's love until morning; let's delight ourselves with passion.
20:7:16:For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
20:7:17:He took a bag of money with him and won't return until the full moon."
20:7:18:With her persuasive words, she led him astray; with her smooth talk, she seduced him.
20:7:19:He followed her without thinking, like an ox going to slaughter, like a deer stepping into a trap.
20:7:20:Until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, not knowing it will cost him his life.
20:7:21:Now then, my children, listen to me; pay attention to the words of my mouth.
20:7:22:Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.
20:7:23:For many have been the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.
20:7:24:Her house is the way to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
20:8:1:Wisdom calls out; understanding raises her voice.
20:8:2:At the highest points along the way, she takes her stand; beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:
20:8:3:"To you, people, I call out; my voice is directed to all humanity.
20:8:4:You who are inexperienced, gain prudence; you who are foolish, acquire understanding.
20:8:5:Listen, for I speak noble things, and the words of my lips are just.
20:8:6:My mouth speaks truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
20:8:7:All the words I say are righteous; there's nothing deceptive or twisted in them.
20:8:8:They are clear to those with understanding and straightforward to those with knowledge.
20:8:9:Accept my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.
20:8:10:For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.
20:8:11:I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
20:8:12:The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride, arrogance, evil behavior, and twisted speech.
20:8:13:Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I possess understanding and strength.
20:8:14:By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws.
20:8:15:Princes govern through me, and noblesâ€”all who judge fairly.
20:8:16:I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently will find me.
20:8:17:With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.
20:8:18:My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver.
20:8:19:I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20:8:20:bestowing wealth on those who love me and filling their treasuries.
20:8:21:The Lord created me as the beginning of his works, before his deeds of old.
20:8:22:I was formed long ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
20:8:23:When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water.
20:8:24:Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was born,
20:8:25:before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.
20:8:26:I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
20:8:27:when he established the clouds above and fixed the fountains of the deep,
20:8:28:when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
20:8:29:Then I was constantly at his side, filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,
20:8:30:rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in humanity.
20:8:31:Now then, children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.
20:8:32:Heed instruction and be wise, do not disregard it.
20:8:33:Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorway.
20:8:34:For those who find me find life and receive favor from the Lord.
20:8:35:But those who fail to find me harm themselves; all who hate me love death."
20:9:1:Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out its seven pillars.
20:9:2:She has prepared her feast, mixed her wine, and set her table.
20:9:3:She has sent out her servant girls, calling out from the highest point of the city,
20:9:4:"Whoever is naive, come in here!" To those lacking understanding, she says,
20:9:5:"Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed.
20:9:6:Leave your simple ways, and you will live; walk in the way of insight."
20:9:7:Correcting a mocker brings insult to oneself; rebuking the wicked incurs abuse.
20:9:8:Do not reprove a mocker, or they will hate you; instead, correct the wise, and they will love you.
20:9:9:Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; instruct the righteous, and they will gain more knowledge.
20:9:10:The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
20:9:11:For through me, your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
20:9:12:If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.
20:9:13:Folly is loud and ignorant; she knows nothing.
20:9:14:She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,
20:9:15:Calling out to those who pass by, going straight on their way,
20:9:16:"Whoever is naive, turn in here!" To those lacking understanding, she says,
20:9:17:"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is delicious."
20:9:18:But they do not know that the dead are there, and her guests are in the depths of the grave.
20:10:1:The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child brings joy to their father, but a foolish child grieves their mother.
20:10:2:Ill-gotten gains do not benefit anyone, but righteousness saves from death.
20:10:3:The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry, but He denies the cravings of the wicked.
20:10:4:A lazy hand causes poverty, while diligent hands bring wealth.
20:10:5:A thoughtful harvester gathers crops in the summer, but one who sleeps during harvest is a disgrace.
20:10:6:Blessings crown the head of the righteous, while violence overwhelms the mouths of the wicked.
20:10:7:The memory of the just is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot away.
20:10:8:The wise-hearted accept commands, but the foolish-mouthed stumble into ruin.
20:10:9:Whoever walks with integrity walks securely, but those who take crooked paths will be found out.
20:10:10:Winking maliciously causes trouble, and foolish talk leads to ruin.
20:10:11:The words of the righteous are a fountain of life, but the speech of the wicked conceals violence.
20:10:12:Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses.
20:10:13:Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, while a rod awaits the back of the one lacking sense.
20:10:14:Wise people store up knowledge, but the mouth of the fool hastens destruction.
20:10:15:The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor.
20:10:16:The wages of the righteous lead to life, but the earnings of the wicked result in sin.
20:10:17:Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life, but those who ignore correction lead others astray.
20:10:18:Concealing hatred has lying lips, and spreading slander makes one a fool.
20:10:19:When words are many, sin is unavoidable, but the wise restrain their lips.
20:10:20:The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, while the heart of the wicked is worth little.
20:10:21:The lips of the righteous nourish many, but fools die for lack of sense.
20:10:22:The Lord's blessing brings wealth, and He adds no sorrow with it.
20:10:23:A fool finds pleasure in wicked schemes, but a person of understanding delights in wisdom.
20:10:24:What the wicked dread will come upon them, but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
20:10:25:When the storm sweeps by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever.
20:10:26:As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy one to those who send them.
20:10:27:Fearing the Lord prolongs life, but the years of the wicked are cut short.
20:10:28:The hope of the righteous brings joy, but the expectations of the wicked come to nothing.
20:10:29:The way of the Lord is a refuge for the blameless, but it brings destruction to evildoers.
20:10:30:The righteous will never be uprooted, but the wicked will not remain in the land.

20:20:12:The Lord has made both our ears to hear and our eyes to see.
20:20:13:Don't love sleep, or you'll become poor; stay awake, and you'll have food in plenty.
20:20:14:"It's worthless, it's worthless!" says the buyer, but after leaving, they brag about their bargain.
20:20:15:There's gold and many precious stones, but wise speech is the most valuable jewel.
20:20:16:Take the garment of someone who puts up collateral for a stranger; hold it as security if they co-sign for a foreigner.

20:20:18:Plans succeed with good advice; don't go to war without wise counsel.

20:20:20:Whoever curses their parents will find their life extinguished like a lamp in utter darkness.
20:20:21:An inheritance obtained too quickly at the beginning won't be blessed in the end.
20:20:22:Don't say, "I'll pay back evil"; wait for the Lord, and He will deliver you.
20:20:23:The Lord detests dishonest scales, and unfair weights are not pleasing to Him.
20:20:24:Our steps are directed by the Lord; how can we understand our own paths?
20:20:25:It's a trap to make a rash vow to God and only later consider its cost.
20:20:26:A wise king scatters the wicked and runs his wheel over them.
20:20:27:The spirit of a person is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the innermost parts.
20:20:28:Love and faithfulness protect the king; his throne is upheld by these virtues.
20:20:29:The glory of young people is their strength; the splendor of old age is their gray hair.
20:20:30:Physical punishment cleanses away evil; such discipline purifies the heart.
20:21:1:A wise king discerns the wicked and separates them like wheat from chaff with his winnowing fan.
20:21:2:People's desires are for their own good, but the Lord directs their steps.
20:21:3:To do what is right and just pleases the Lord more than sacrifice.
20:21:4:Arrogant eyes and a proud heartâ€”the lamp of the wickedâ€”are sinful.
20:21:5:Careful planning leads to profit, but hasty decisions bring poverty.
20:21:6:Gaining wealth through dishonest means is like chasing the wind; it leads to death.
20:21:7:The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right.
20:21:8:Twisted people follow crooked paths, but the blameless walk in straight ways.
20:21:9:It is better to live alone in a corner of the attic than share a house with a quarrelsome spouse.
20:21:10:The soul of the wicked craves evil; they show no mercy to their neighbors.
20:21:11:When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; when the wise are instructed, they increase in knowledge.
20:21:12:The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.
20:21:13:Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.
20:21:14:A secret gift calms anger, and a concealed bribe soothes fierce rage.
20:21:15:Justice brings joy to the righteous, but terror to those who practice evil.
20:21:16:Whoever strays from the path of understanding ends up in the company of the dead.
20:21:17:Loving pleasure leads to poverty; loving wine and luxury will never make you rich.

20:21:19:It's better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging spouse.

20:21:23:Those who guard their mouths and tongues protect themselves from trouble.
20:21:24:Proud and arrogant people are called mockers; they act with insolent fury.
20:21:25:The desires of the lazy kill them, for their hands refuse to work.
20:21:26:Greed brings grief all day long, but the righteous give generously without holding back.
20:21:27:The sacrifice of the wicked is detestableâ€”how much more so when brought with evil intent!
20:21:28:A false witness will perish, but a careful listener will testify successfully.
20:21:29:The wicked put on a bold face, but the upright establish their path.
20:21:30:There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the Lord.
20:21:31:The horse is prepared for battle, but victory belongs to the Lord.
20:22:1:A good name is more valuable than great riches, and the respect of others is better than silver and gold.
20:22:2:The rich and poor have this in common: the Lord created them both.
20:22:3:Being prudent means seeing danger and taking refuge, while the naive continue on and suffer the consequences.
20:22:4:Humility and reverence for the Lord bring wealth, honor, and life.
20:22:5:Thorns and snares are in the path of the crooked; those who want to protect their lives will stay far from them.
20:22:6:Teach a child the right way when they're young, and when they're older, they won't stray from it.
20:22:7:The wealthy rule over the poor, and borrowers become slaves to lenders.
20:22:8:Those who sow injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of their anger will be broken.
20:22:9:A generous person will be blessed, for they share their food with the poor.
20:22:10:Drive out the mocker, and conflict will go with them; strife and insults will cease.
20:22:11:Whoever loves a pure heart and speaks graciously has the king as a friend.
20:22:12:The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge, but he undermines the words of the unfaithful.
20:22:13:The lazy person says, "There's a lion outside! I'll be killed in the streets!"
20:22:14:The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit; whoever the Lord is angry with will fall into it.
20:22:15:Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but discipline drives it away.
20:22:16:Oppressing the poor to increase one's wealth or giving to the rich will only lead to poverty.
20:22:17:Pay attention and listen to the words of the wise; apply your heart to my knowledge.
20:22:18:For it is pleasant if you keep them within you, letting them be established in your heart.
20:22:19:So that your trust may be in the Lord, I have taught you today, even you.
20:22:20:Have I not written thirty sayings for you, full of advice and knowledge?
20:22:21:To teach you true and reliable words, so that you can give sound answers to those who sent you?
20:22:22:Do not exploit the poor because they are poor, and do not crush the needy in court.
20:22:23:For the Lord will defend their cause and strip away the life of those who oppress them.
20:22:24:Don't make friends with an angry person, and don't associate with one prone to rage.
20:22:25:You might learn their ways and find yourself ensnared.
20:22:26:Don't be among those who shake hands in a pledge, who put up security for debts.

20:22:28:Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your ancestors.

20:23:1:Pay attention when you sit down with a ruler; think carefully about what's in front of you.
20:23:2:If you have a big appetite, control yourself;
20:23:3:don't be too eager for his delicacies, as they can be deceptive.
20:23:4:Don't wear yourself out trying to get rich; be wise enough to know when to stop.
20:23:5:In the blink of an eye, wealth disappears, like an eagle soaring away into the sky.
20:23:6:Don't eat the food of a stingy person or crave their delicacies;
20:23:7:their thoughts are calculating, and they'll say, "Eat and drink," but their heart isn't with you.
20:23:8:You'll end up wasting your words and feeling sick after eating their food.
20:23:9:Avoid speaking wisdom to a fool; they won't appreciate your insight.
20:23:10:Don't move ancient boundary stones or encroach on the fields of orphans,
20:23:11:for their Defender is strong, and He will protect them against you.
20:23:12:Commit to learning and open your heart to understanding.
20:23:13:Don't hesitate to discipline a child; if you correct them, they won't die.
20:23:14:Indeed, by disciplining them, you may save their life.
20:23:15:My child, if your heart is wise, my own heart will rejoice.
20:23:16:My innermost being will celebrate when you speak what is right.
20:23:17:Don't envy sinners, but always respect the Lord.
20:23:18:For there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
20:23:19:Hear me, my child, and be wise; guide your heart on the right path.
20:23:20:Don't join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat,
20:23:21:for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
20:23:22:Listen to your father, who gave you life, and don't despise your mother when she is old.
20:23:23:Buy truth and wisdom, instruction and understandingâ€”don't sell them.
20:23:24:The father of a righteous child has great joy; a parent who raises a wise child delights in them.
20:23:25:Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.
20:23:26:My child, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways,
20:23:27:for an immoral woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
20:23:28:She lies in wait like a robber and increases the unfaithful among men.
20:23:29:Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
20:23:30:Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
20:23:31:Don't gaze at wine when it's red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly;
20:23:32:in the end, it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.
20:23:33:Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things.
20:23:34:You'll feel as if you're lying on the high seas, tossed by the waves.
20:23:35:"They struck me," you'll say, "but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?"
20:24:1:Don't be jealous of evil people or desire to be with them,
20:24:2:For their hearts are full of violence, and their words bring trouble.
20:24:3:Wisdom builds a house, and understanding establishes it,
20:24:4:Through knowledge its rooms are filled with precious and beautiful treasures.
20:24:5:A wise man has great power, and a person with knowledge increases strength;
20:24:6:For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.
20:24:7:Wisdom is too high for fools; they cannot reach it in the assembly at the city gates.
20:24:8:Whoever plans to do evil will be known as a schemer.
20:24:9:The schemes of folly are sin, and those who mock are detestable to others.
20:24:10:If you falter during times of trouble, your strength is small indeed.
20:24:11:Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those stumbling toward slaughter.
20:24:12:If you say, "We knew nothing about this," doesn't He who weighs the heart perceive it? The One who guards your life knows, and He will repay each person according to their deeds.
20:24:13:Eat honey, my child, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
20:24:14:Know that wisdom is like honey for you; if you find it, there's a future hope for you, and your hope won't be cut off.
20:24:15:Do not lie in wait, wicked one, against the home of the righteous; do not destroy their dwelling place.
20:24:16:Though the righteous may fall seven times, they will rise again; but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.
20:24:17:Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and don't let your heart be glad when they stumble,
20:24:18:Or the Lord will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from them.
20:24:19:Don't fret because of evildoers or be envious of the wicked,
20:24:20:For there is no future for the evil one; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
20:24:21:Fear the Lord and the king, my child, and don't associate with those who are rebellious,
20:24:22:For their disaster will arise suddenly, and who knows what ruin may come from both?
20:24:23:Here are more sayings of the wise: Showing partiality in judgment is not good.
20:24:24:Whoever says to the guilty, "You are innocent," will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.
20:24:25:But those who rebuke the guilty will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.
20:24:26:Honest lips give a fitting reply, like a kiss on the lips.
20:24:27:Put your outdoor work in order and prepare your fields; afterward, build your house.
20:24:28:Don't testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive.
20:24:29:Don't say, "I'll do to them as they have done to me; I'll repay them for what they did."
20:24:30:I went past the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of someone lacking sense;
20:24:31:Thistles had taken over the ground, weeds covered the face of it, and the stone wall was broken down.
20:24:32:I saw and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction:
20:24:33:A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to restâ€”
20:24:34:And poverty will come on you like a thief, and scarcity like an armed man.
20:25:1:Here are more proverbs from Solomon, collected by the scholars of King Hezekiah of Judah:

20:25:3:As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.

20:25:5:Similarly, remove wickedness from the king's presence, and his reign will be established in righteousness.
20:25:6:Don't boast in front of the king or claim a place among great people;
20:25:7:It's better to be told, "Come up here," than to be humiliated before a noble.
20:25:8:Don't jump to conclusions when you see something; if your neighbor disproves you, you'll be embarrassed.

20:26:2:Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse won't find its target.
20:26:3:A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools.

20:26:19:So is the person who deceives their neighbor and says, "I was only joking!"
20:26:20:Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a quarrel dies down.
20:26:21:As charcoal is to burning embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
20:26:22:The words of a gossip are like tasty morsels; they go down deep into the innermost parts.
20:26:23:Smooth words with an evil heart are like glaze on a clay pot.

20:27:10:Don't forsake your friend or your father's friend, and don't go to your brother's house in times of trouble. A neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.

20:27:21:The crucible is for refining silver and the furnace for gold, but people are tested by the praise they receive.

20:27:25:When the hay is removed and new growth appears, and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
20:27:26:the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.

20:28:12:When the righteous succeed, there's great celebration, but when the wicked rise to power, people hide.
20:28:13:Concealing your sins won't bring success, but confessing and renouncing them will lead to mercy.
20:28:14:Blessed are those who always fear the Lord, but stubborn hearts will fall into trouble.
20:28:15:Like a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.

20:29:1:Whoever stubbornly refuses to accept criticism will suddenly be broken beyond repair.
20:29:2:When the righteous thrive, people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, they groan.
20:29:3:Someone who loves wisdom brings joy to their father, while one who keeps company with prostitutes wastes their wealth.
20:29:4:A just ruler strengthens a nation, but a greedy one tears it down.
20:29:5:Flattery is a trap for your neighbor, ensnaring them in a web of deceit.
20:29:6:An evil person is ensnared by their own sin, but the righteous sing and rejoice.

20:29:11:Fools give full vent to their rage, but the wise bring calm in the end.
20:29:12:If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.
20:29:13:The poor and the oppressor have this in common: The Lord gives sight to the eyes of both.
20:29:14:If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will be established forever.
20:29:15:Discipline and correction give wisdom, but a child left to themselves brings shame to their mother.
20:29:16:When the wicked increase, so does sin, but the righteous will witness their downfall.
20:29:17:Discipline your child, and they will give you peace; they will bring delight to your soul.
20:29:18:Where there is no vision, people cast off restraint; but blessed is the one who heeds wisdom's instruction.
20:29:19:A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though they understand, they will not respond.
20:29:20:Do you see someone who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for them.
20:29:21:If someone pampers their servant from youth, they will become a master in the end.
20:29:22:An angry person stirs up conflict, and a hot-tempered one commits many sins.
20:29:23:Pride brings a person low, but the humble in spirit gain honor.
20:29:24:Partnership with a thief is self-destructive; they curse themselves when an oath is demanded.
20:29:25:Fearing people is a dangerous trap, but trusting in the Lord means safety.
20:29:26:Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the Lord that one gets justice.
20:29:27:The righteous detest the dishonest; the wicked detest the upright.
20:30:1:The sayings of Agur, son of Jakehâ€”an inspired message. This man declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
20:30:2:Surely, I am the most ignorant of men; I lack human understanding.
20:30:3:I haven't gained wisdom, nor have I discovered the knowledge of the Holy One.
20:30:4:Who has ascended into heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is the name of his sonâ€”if you know?
20:30:5:Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
20:30:6:Do not add to his words, lest he reprove you and prove you a liar.
20:30:7:Two things I request of you; do not deny them to me before I die:
20:30:8:Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but provide me with my daily bread.
20:30:9:Lest I become full and deny you, saying, "Who is the LORD?" Or, lest I become poor and steal, dishonoring the name of my God.
20:30:10:Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will bear the guilt.
20:30:11:There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
20:30:12:There are those who are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleansed of their filth.
20:30:13:There are thoseâ€”oh how lofty are their eyes, and their eyelids raised in arrogance!
20:30:14:There are those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are knives, devouring the poor from the earth and the needy from among humanity.
20:30:15:The leech has two daughters: "Give! Give!" Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough!":
20:30:16:the grave, the barren womb, the earth that is never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough!"
20:30:17:The eye that mocks a father and scorns obedience to a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by vultures.
20:30:18:Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:
20:30:19:the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.
20:30:20:This is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done nothing wrong."
20:30:21:Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:
20:30:22:a servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food,
20:30:23:an unloved woman who is married, and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.
20:30:24:Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
20:30:25:the ants, creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
20:30:26:the rock badgers, feeble creatures, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
20:30:27:the locusts, having no king, yet they advance together in ranks;
20:30:28:the lizard, easily caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.
20:30:29:There are three things that are stately in their stride, and four that move with stately bearing:
20:30:30:a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing;
20:30:31:a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king with his army around him.
20:30:32:If you have foolishly exalted yourself or if you have plotted evil, put your hand over your mouth.
20:30:33:For as churning cream produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife.
20:31:1:The sayings of King Lemuel, taught to him by his mother:
20:31:2:My son, what should I tell you? You are the child of my womb and the answer to my prayers.
20:31:3:Don't waste your strength on women or your efforts on those who destroy kings.
20:31:4:It's not suitable for kings, Lemuel, it's not suitable for kings to drink wine, nor rulers to crave strong drink,
20:31:5:Lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the rights of the needy.
20:31:6:Give strong drink to the one in despair, and wine to those with heavy hearts.
20:31:7:Let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more.
20:31:8:Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, and ensure justice for the oppressed.
20:31:9:Defend the rights of the poor and needy.
20:31:10:A virtuous woman, who can find? Her worth is far above jewels.
20:31:11:Her husband trusts her completely; she brings him good, not harm, all her life.
20:31:12:She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
20:31:13:Like a merchant ship, she brings food from afar.
20:31:14:Rising before dawn, she provides food for her household and assigns tasks to her servants.
20:31:15:She considers a field and buys it; she plants a vineyard with her earnings.
20:31:16:She prepares herself with strength and makes her arms strong.
20:31:17:She perceives that her business is profitable, and her lamp doesn't go out at night.
20:31:18:She reaches out her hands to the spindle, and her fingers hold the distaff.
20:31:19:She extends her hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy.
20:31:20:She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her family is clothed in scarlet.
20:31:21:She makes her own bed coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20:31:22:Her husband is respected at the city gates, where he takes his seat among the elders.
20:31:23:She makes linen garments and sells them; she supplies sashes to the merchants.
20:31:24:Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the days to come.
20:31:25:She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
20:31:26:She watches over the affairs of her household and doesn't eat the bread of idleness.
20:31:27:Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also praises her:
20:31:28:"Many women have done noble deeds, but you surpass them all."
20:31:29:Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
20:31:30:Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the city gates.
