21:1:1:Everything is fleeting, says the Philosopher, the son of David and king in Jerusalem.
21:1:2:Life's emptiness consumes me, for all human pursuits are futile under the sun.
21:1:3:What lasting value can one gain from all their toil and labor on this earth?
21:1:4:Generations come and go, while the earth endures forever.
21:1:5:The sun rises and sets, returning to its place to rise again.
21:1:6:The wind blows southward, then turns to the north; it circles around continually, following its course.
21:1:7:Rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea never overflows; they return to their source and begin anew.
21:1:8:All things are wearisome—more than we can express. The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
21:1:9:History repeats itself; what has been will be again, and what has been done will be done once more.
21:1:10:There's nothing new under the sun; if something seems new, it's only because it existed long ago.
21:1:11:Past events are forgotten, and future generations will forget what happens now.
21:1:12:I, the Philosopher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21:1:13:I devoted myself to study and explore wisdom concerning everything that occurs under the heavens. This burdensome task God has given humanity.
21:1:14:I've observed all the deeds done under the sun, and I've found them all to be meaningless, like chasing the wind.
21:1:15:What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
21:1:16:I said to myself, "I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who came before me in Jerusalem. My mind has grasped wisdom and knowledge."
21:1:17:But when I applied my heart to understand wisdom, as well as madness and folly, I realized that this too was like chasing the wind.
21:1:18:For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
21:2:1:I decided to explore the pleasures of life, seeking happiness through wine and folly, but keeping my mind wise.
21:2:2:Then I thought of building great projects, constructing houses and planting vineyards for myself.
21:2:3:I created gardens and parks, planting all kinds of fruit trees in them.
21:2:4:I constructed reservoirs to water the flourishing trees.
21:2:5:I acquired slaves, both male and female, as well as those born in my household. I also owned vast herds and flocks, more than any who came before me in Jerusalem.
21:2:6:I amassed silver and gold, treasures from kings and provinces. I indulged in music with male and female singers, and enjoyed the pleasures of many concubines.
21:2:7:In my quest for greatness, I became greater than anyone in Jerusalem before me, yet wisdom remained with me.
21:2:8:Nothing that my eyes desired was denied to me; I did not withhold any pleasure from my heart. I found joy in my achievements, and this was my reward for all my efforts.
21:2:9:However, when I reflected on everything I had done and the accomplishments I had achieved, it all seemed meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was no lasting benefit under the sun.
21:2:10:So I turned my attention to wisdom, madness, and folly. What can a person do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.
21:2:11:I realized that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.
21:2:12:The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in darkness; but I also understood that the same fate awaits them both.
21:2:13:So I thought, "What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been so wise?" And I said to myself, "This too is meaningless."
21:2:14:The wise and the foolish both die, and in the days to come, they are both forgotten.
21:2:15:So I hated life, because everything done under the sun seemed futile to me; it was like chasing the wind.
21:2:16:I hated all my hard work for which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the one who comes after me.
21:2:17:And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my labor, for which I have poured out my wisdom, knowledge, and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
21:2:18:So I fell into despair over all my toil and hard work under the sun.
21:2:19:For sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom, knowledge, and skill must leave everything they own to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
21:2:20:What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun?
21:2:21:Their days are full of sorrow, and their work is a vexation. Even at night, their hearts do not rest. This too is meaningless.
21:2:22:There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,
21:2:23:For without Him, who can eat or find enjoyment?
21:2:24:To the person who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner, He gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, like chasing the wind.
21:3:1:In life, there's a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens:
21:3:2:A time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted;
21:3:3:A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build up;
21:3:4:A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;
21:3:5:A time to scatter stones and a time to gather them; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;
21:3:6:A time to search and a time to give up; a time to keep and a time to throw away;
21:3:7:A time to tear and a time to mend; a time to be silent and a time to speak;
21:3:8:A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.
21:3:9:What do workers gain from their toil?
21:3:10:I have seen the burden God has placed on humanity.
21:3:11:He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
21:3:12:I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.
21:3:13:That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God.
21:3:14:I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.
21:3:15:What is now has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.
21:3:16:And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment—wickedness was there, in the place of justice—wickedness was there.
21:3:17:I said to myself, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed."
21:3:18:I also said to myself, "As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals."
21:3:19:Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless.
21:3:20:All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.
21:3:21:Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?"
21:3:22:So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
21:4:1:In this chapter, I observed that the oppressed have tears, but no one comforts them. Power is on the side of their oppressors, and they have no comforter.
21:4:2:Therefore, I praised those who have already died more than the living who still walk the earth.
21:4:3:But better than both of these is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds done under the sun.
21:4:4:I noticed that all toil and achievement stem from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:4:5:The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
21:4:6:Better is a handful of quietness than two handfuls of toil and striving after the wind.
21:4:7:Again, I saw something pointless under the sun:
21:4:8:There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless—a miserable business!
21:4:9:Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
21:4:10:If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.
21:4:11:Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
21:4:12:Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
21:4:13:Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning.
21:4:14:The youth may have come from prison to the throne, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.
21:4:15:I saw that everyone followed the youth, the king's successor.
21:4:16:There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21:5:1:Pay attention when you go to the house of God. It's better to listen than to offer foolish sacrifices, because they don't know they're doing wrong.
21:5:2:Be careful with your words and don't be hasty in your heart to say anything before God. After all, he's in heaven and you're on earth, so let your words be few.
21:5:3:For just as a dream comes with many cares, so does a fool's voice come with many words.
21:5:4:When you make a promise to God, don't delay in fulfilling it, because he takes no pleasure in fools. Keep the vow you've made.
21:5:5:It's better not to make a vow at all than to make one and not keep it.
21:5:6:Don't let your mouth lead you into sin, and don't say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry with what you said and destroy the work of your hands?
21:5:7:In a multitude of dreams and many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.
21:5:8:If you see the poor oppressed or justice and rights denied in a district, don't be surprised. For one official watches over another, and higher ones are over them.
21:5:9:The land's produce benefits everyone, even the king himself is served by the fields.
21:5:10:The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money, and whoever loves wealth will never be satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.
21:5:11:As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owner except to feast their eyes on them?
21:5:12:The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep.
21:5:13:I've seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
21:5:14:or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit.
21:5:15:Everyone comes naked from their mother's womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands.
21:5:16:This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind?
21:5:17:All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction, and anger.
21:5:18:Here is what I've seen to be good: it's appropriate to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in all the toil one does under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot.
21:5:19:Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift from God.
21:5:20:They seldom reflect on the days of their life because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.
21:6:1:There's a tragedy I've observed under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity:
21:6:2:A person to whom God has given wealth, possessions, and honor, but doesn't grant the ability to enjoy them. Instead, someone else ends up enjoying the fruits of their labor. This is meaningless—a grievous affliction.
21:6:3:Even if someone lives a thousand years twice over, but doesn't experience contentment, what's the point? Doesn't everyone ultimately face the same fate?
21:6:4:We emerge from our mother's womb naked and empty-handed, and we will return to the earth just as bare as we came. We can't take anything with us from our labor.
21:6:5:This too is a sad reality: We spend our entire lives in darkness, consumed by frustration, sickness, and anger.
21:6:6:No matter how long someone lives, if they don't find satisfaction during their time on earth, they might as well have never been born.
21:6:7:All of a person's efforts are spent trying to satisfy their appetites, yet these desires are never truly fulfilled.
21:6:8:What advantage does a wise person have over a fool? What benefit does a poor individual gain by knowing how to survive in this life?
21:6:9:It's better to be content with what you can see than to chase after your desires. This too is meaningless—like chasing the wind.
21:6:10:Everything that exists has already been named, and we know what it means to be human. No one can argue with someone more powerful than themselves.
21:6:11:The more words there are, the more futile they become. So, what's the benefit in all this?
21:6:12:Who knows what's best for a person during their brief life, which passes like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they're gone?
21:7:1:A good reputation is more valuable than expensive perfume, and the day you die is better than the day you were born.
21:7:2:It's wiser to attend a funeral than a party, for death is the destiny of everyone, and the living should take it to heart.
21:7:3:Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face can lead to a happy heart.
21:7:4:The hearts of the wise are in the house of mourning, but the hearts of fools are in the house of pleasure.
21:7:5:Listening to the rebuke of a wise person is better than listening to the songs of fools.
21:7:6:For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.
21:7:7:Oppression can drive a wise person mad, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21:7:8:The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.
21:7:9:Don't be quick-tempered, for anger resides in the heart of fools.
21:7:10:Don't ask, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it's not wise to dwell on such questions.
21:7:11:Wisdom, along with an inheritance, is good and beneficial to those who see the sun.
21:7:12:For wisdom offers protection like money does, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of those who possess it.
21:7:13:Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
21:7:14:When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made both the one and the other, so that people won't know what the future holds.
21:7:15:In my fleeting life, I have seen both of these: a righteous person perishing in their righteousness and a wicked person living long in their wickedness.
21:7:16:Don't be overly righteous or excessively wise—why destroy yourself?
21:7:17:Don't be overly wicked or foolish—why die before your time?
21:7:18:It's good to grasp both of these and not let go of one for the other, for the one who fears God will avoid both extremes.
21:7:19:Wisdom makes a wise person stronger than ten rulers in a city.
21:7:20:Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.
21:7:21:Don't pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you—
21:7:22:for you know in your heart that you too have cursed others many times.
21:7:23:I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, "I am determined to be wise," but it was beyond me.
21:7:24:Whatever exists is far off and most profound—who can discover it?
21:7:25:I turned my mind to understand, explore, and seek wisdom and an explanation for things, and to understand the wickedness of folly and the foolishness of madness.
21:7:26:I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The one who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner will be ensnared.
21:7:27:"Look," says the Teacher, "this is what I discovered: Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—
21:7:28:while my soul was still searching but not finding—I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.
21:7:29:This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes."
21:8:1:In matters of wisdom, who is like the wise? Who can explain the meaning of things? A person's wisdom brightens their face and softens their stern appearance.
21:8:2:I advise you to obey the king's command, especially when you have taken an oath before God.
21:8:3:Don't be in a hurry to leave the king's presence or persist in an unpleasant situation, for the king does whatever he pleases.
21:8:4:Since the word of the king is authoritative, no one can question what he says.
21:8:5:Those who obey his command will avoid trouble; the wise heart knows the right time and way to act.
21:8:6:For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though human misery weighs heavily upon us.
21:8:7:No one knows what the future holds; who can tell them what will happen?
21:8:8:No one has power over the wind to contain it; likewise, no one has control over the day of their death. There is no escape from this battle, and wickedness will not save the wicked.
21:8:9:I observed all this and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time when one person rules over others to their own detriment.
21:8:10:Then I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This too is meaningless.
21:8:11:When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people's hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong.
21:8:12:Although a sinner may do evil a hundred times and still live a long life, I know that it will go better for those who fear God and are respectful before him.
21:8:13:But it will not go well for the wicked, nor will they prolong their days like a shadow, because they do not fear God.
21:8:14:There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous people who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked people who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.
21:8:15:So I commend the enjoyment of life because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun.
21:8:16:When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night—
21:8:17:I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what happens under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.
21:9:1:People's hearts are in the hands of God, and no one knows whether love or hate awaits them.
21:9:2:Everything seems to happen at random—both the righteous and the wicked experience the same events, good and bad, clean and unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who don't. It's all the same for everyone.
21:9:3:This sad reality affects everyone on earth: evil is present in every heart, and madness persists throughout their lives. Eventually, everyone dies.
21:9:4:But there's still hope for those who are alive, because a living dog is better off than a dead lion.
21:9:5:The living know they will die, but the dead don't know anything. They have no more reward, and even their memory fades away.
21:9:6:Their love, hate, and jealousy vanish, and they will never again take part in anything that happens under the sun.
21:9:7:So go ahead, eat your food with joy and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God has already approved what you do.
21:9:8:Always wear fine clothes and keep your head fragrant with oil.
21:9:9:Enjoy life with the person you love, all the days of your fleeting life which God has given you under the sun—this is your reward for your hard work on earth.
21:9:10:Whatever you find to do, do it with all your might, because there's no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave where you're headed.
21:9:11:I observed something else under the sun: the race doesn't always go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor does food always come to the wise, wealth to the intelligent, or favor to the skillful. Time and chance happen to everyone.
21:9:12:No one knows when their time will come, like fish caught in a cruel net or birds trapped in a snare. People are ensnared by life's evils when they least expect it.
21:9:13:I also saw this example of wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me:
21:9:14:There was once a small city with only a few inhabitants. A powerful king attacked it, surrounding it and building massive siege ramps against its walls.
21:9:15:But there was a wise man in that city who, through his wisdom, saved the city. Yet nobody remembered him.
21:9:16:So I concluded that wisdom is better than strength, but the wisdom of the poor is often ignored, and their words are not heeded.
21:9:17:The calm words of the wise are more effective than the shouts of a ruler commanding fools.
21:9:18:Wisdom is more valuable than weapons of war, but just one sinner can destroy much good.
21:10:1:A little foolishness can outweigh wisdom and honor.
21:10:2:The wise person's heart leads them to the right, but a fool's heart guides them to the left.
21:10:3:When a fool walks down the road, they lack sense and display their foolishness for all to see.
21:10:4:If your superior gets angry with you, don't quit; calmness can correct many mistakes.
21:10:5:One evil I've observed under the sun is an error that comes from those in power:
21:10:6:Fools being placed in high positions while the rich occupy low ones.
21:10:7:I've seen slaves on horseback and princes walking like slaves on the ground.
21:10:8:Those who dig a pit may fall into it, and whoever breaks through a wall might be bitten by a snake.
21:10:9:Whoever moves stones could get hurt, and those who split logs may be endangered.
21:10:10:If an ax is dull and not sharpened, one must use more strength; but skill brings success.
21:10:11:If a snake bites before it's charmed, there's no advantage for the charmer.
21:10:12:The words of a wise person bring grace, but the lips of a fool consume them.
21:10:13:Foolish talk starts as silliness and ends in wicked madness.
21:10:14:Fools are full of words, but no one knows what will happen next; who can predict what lies ahead?
21:10:15:The labor of fools wearies them because they don't know how to find their way to the city.
21:10:16:Woe to the land whose king is immature and whose leaders feast in the morning!
21:10:17:Happy is the land whose king is noble and whose leaders eat at the right time, for strength and not for drunkenness.
21:10:18:Through laziness, the roof sags; and because of idle hands, the house leaks.
21:10:19:Feasts are made for laughter, wine brings happiness, and money answers everything.
21:10:20:Don't curse the king, even in your thoughts, nor the rich in your bedroom; for a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a winged creature might report what you say.
21:11:1:Invest your resources, spreading them out over various endeavors, because you don't know what the future holds.
21:11:2:Give a portion of your wealth to seven, even eight ventures, for you cannot predict when disaster may strike.
21:11:3:When clouds are full, they release rain upon the earth; similarly, when a tree falls, it lies where it has fallen.
21:11:4:If you wait for perfect conditions, you will never sow or reap.
21:11:5:Just as you cannot comprehend the workings of the wind or how life begins in a mother's womb, so you cannot grasp the work of God, the Creator of all things.
21:11:6:Sow your seed in the morning and keep busy in the evening, for you don't know which efforts will succeed, whether one or the other, or if both will be equally fruitful.
21:11:7:Light is sweet, and it is delightful for the eyes to see the sun.
21:11:8:Even if a person lives many years, let them rejoice in each day. But remember that dark days will come, and they will be numerous. Everything that lies ahead is fleeting.
21:11:9:Young people, rejoice in your youth, and let your heart bring you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes, but know that God will judge you for all these things.
21:11:10:Remove sorrow from your heart and banish pain from your body, for youth and vigor are fleeting.
21:12:1:Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before difficult times come and the years approach when you'll say, "I find no pleasure in them."
21:12:2:While the sun still shines, or the light, the moon, and the stars are not darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
21:12:3:When the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;
21:12:4:When the doors to the street are shut, and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;
21:12:5:Also when they are afraid of heights and dangers on the road; when the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire is no longer stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
21:12:6:Remember Him before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well.
21:12:7:Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.
21:12:8:"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"
21:12:9:Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
21:12:10:The Teacher sought to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.
21:12:11:The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.
21:12:12:Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.
21:12:13:Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind.
21:12:14:For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
