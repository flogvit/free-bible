46:1:1:From Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
46:1:2:To the church of God in Corinth, made holy in Christ Jesus and called to be saints, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
46:1:3:Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:4:I always thank my God for you because of the grace He has given you in Christ Jesus.
46:1:5:Through Him, you have been enriched in every way—in speech and knowledge—
46:1:6:Because the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
46:1:7:So that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:8:He will sustain you to the end, blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:1:9:God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
46:1:10:Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree with one another and to avoid divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.
46:1:11:For I have been informed, my friends, by members of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.
46:1:12:What I mean is this: Each of you says, "I follow Paul," or "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ."
46:1:13:Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
46:1:14:I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
46:1:15:So no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
46:1:16:Well, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't recall if I baptized anyone else.
46:1:17:For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with eloquent words, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
46:1:18:For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
46:1:19:As it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate."
46:1:20:Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
46:1:21:For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know Him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
46:1:22:Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
46:1:23:But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
46:1:24:Yet to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
46:1:25:For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
46:1:26:Consider your own calling, brothers and sisters: Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were influential, not many were of noble birth.
46:1:27:But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
46:1:28:He chose the lowly and despised things of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,
46:1:29:So that no one may boast in His presence.
46:1:30:It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.
46:1:31:Therefore, as it is written: "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
46:2:1:When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I didn't come with fancy speech or superior wisdom as I proclaimed the mystery of God.
46:2:2:For I decided to focus on nothing among you except Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.
46:2:3:I approached you in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
46:2:4:My message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,
46:2:5:so that your faith wouldn't be based on human wisdom, but on the power of God.
46:2:6:However, we do speak wisdom among those who are mature, but it's not the wisdom of this age or of the world's rulers, who are coming to nothing.
46:2:7:Instead, we speak God's hidden wisdom in a mystery, which He predetermined before the ages for our glory.
46:2:8:None of the rulers of this age understood this wisdom, because if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
46:2:9:As it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love him."
46:2:10:But God revealed these things to us through the Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.
46:2:11:For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
46:2:12:We received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.
46:2:13:And we speak about these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
46:2:14:The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to them and they cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
46:2:15:The spiritual person judges all things, but is not subject to anyone else's judgment.
46:2:16:For, "Who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
46:3:1:Brothers and sisters, when I was with you, I couldn't talk to you as spiritual people but only as worldly ones, like infants in Christ.
46:3:2:I fed you with milk, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. In fact, even now you're still not ready.
46:3:3:You're still living by human standards, because there's jealousy and strife among you. Doesn't this show that you are acting like ordinary people?
46:3:4:When one of you says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you merely being human?
46:3:5:Who is Apollos, really? And who is Paul? We're just servants through whom you came to believe, each doing the work God assigned us.
46:3:6:I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.
46:3:7:So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters matters, but only God, who makes things grow.
46:3:8:The one who plants and the one who waters work together, and they'll each be rewarded according to their own labor.
46:3:9:For we are God's coworkers; you are God's field, God's building.
46:3:10:By the grace God gave me, I laid a foundation like a skilled master builder, and someone else is building on it. But let each builder be careful how they build.
46:3:11:No one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
46:3:12:If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
46:3:13:their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test the quality of each builder's work.
46:3:14:If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
46:3:15:But if it's burned up, the builder will suffer loss but still be saved, though only as through fire.
46:3:16:Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?
46:3:17:If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
46:3:18:Let no one deceive themselves. If any of you think you're wise by the standards of this age, you should become "fools" so that you may become truly wise.
46:3:19:For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness."
46:3:20:And again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile."
46:3:21:So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,
46:3:22:whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all belong to you,
46:3:23:and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
46:4:1:So, think of us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries.
46:4:2:Moreover, it is required in stewards that they be found trustworthy.
46:4:3:But it matters little to me if I am judged by you or any human court; I don't even judge myself.
46:4:4:Although I'm not aware of anything against myself, it doesn't make me innocent. The Lord is the one who judges me.
46:4:5:Therefore, don't judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of people's hearts. Then each person will receive their praise from God.
46:4:6:Brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you won't become arrogant, favoring one person over another.
46:4:7:For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you didn't receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you didn't?
46:4:8:You already have everything you want! You've become rich! Without us, you've become kings! I wish you really were reigning, so that we might reign with you!
46:4:9:It seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to humans.
46:4:10:We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, while we are dishonored!
46:4:11:To this very hour, we go hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, brutally treated, and homeless.
46:4:12:We work hard with our own hands. When we're cursed, we bless; when persecuted, we endure it;
46:4:13:when slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.
46:4:14:I'm not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.
46:4:15:Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you don't have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
46:4:16:So I urge you to imitate me.
46:4:17:For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere in every church.
46:4:18:Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I won't come to you.
46:4:19:But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only what these arrogant people are saying, but also what power they possess.
46:4:20:For the kingdom of God is not about talk but about power.
46:4:21:What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?
46:5:1:It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not even tolerated among non-believers—a man has his father's wife.
46:5:2:And yet you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with sadness and expelled the one who committed this deed?
46:5:3:Though I am not physically present with you, I am in spirit. As if I were there, I have already judged the one who did this.
46:5:4:In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus,
46:5:5:hand over this man to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
46:5:6:Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?
46:5:7:Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, without any yeast, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
46:5:8:So let us celebrate the feast, not with the old yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
46:5:9:I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
46:5:10:But I wasn't referring to the people of this world who are immoral or greedy, swindlers or idolaters. In that case, you would have to leave this world.
46:5:11:What I meant was that you shouldn't associate with anyone who claims to be a believer but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater, verbally abusive, a drunkard, or a swindler. Don't even eat with such people.
46:5:12:It is not my responsibility to judge those outside the church, but shouldn't you judge those inside?
46:5:13:God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked person from among you.
46:6:1:When you have disputes among yourselves, how can you take them to those who are not part of the church for judgment? This should not be the case!
46:6:2:Don't you know that God's people will judge the world? If you're going to judge the world, surely you can handle minor issues.
46:6:3:We are even meant to judge angels! How much more, then, matters of everyday life?
46:6:4:So, when you have disputes about such things, why appoint judges from outside the church?
46:6:5:I say this to your shame. Isn't there even one wise person among you who can settle disputes between fellow believers?
46:6:6:Instead, one believer takes another to court, and this happens in front of unbelievers!
46:6:7:The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you've already lost. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
46:6:8:But instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat others—even your fellow believers.
46:6:9:Don't you realize that those who do wrong won't inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived! Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who have sex with men,
46:6:10:nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the Kingdom of God.
46:6:11:Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed, made holy, and declared right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
46:6:12:While everything is permissible for me, not everything is beneficial. Everything is allowed, but I won't be controlled by anything.
46:6:13:Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food—but God will destroy both. The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
46:6:14:By raising the Lord from the dead, God will also raise us up.
46:6:15:Don't you know that your bodies are parts of Christ? Should I take a part of Christ and unite it with a prostitute? No way!
46:6:16:Don't you realize that when you're joined to a prostitute, you become one body with her? As Scripture says, "The two will become one flesh."
46:6:17:But whoever is united with the Lord becomes one spirit with Him.
46:6:18:Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against their own body.
46:6:19:Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own;
46:6:20:you were bought at a price. So honor God with your body.
46:7:1:Now concerning the matters you wrote about, it's good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
46:7:2:However, because of the temptation to immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
46:7:3:The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
46:7:4:The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Similarly, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
46:7:5:Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
46:7:6:I say this as a concession, not as a command.
46:7:7:I wish that all people were like me, but each person has their own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
46:7:8:To the unmarried and widows, I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am.
46:7:9:But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
46:7:10:To the married, I give this command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband.
46:7:11:But if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
46:7:12:To the rest, I say this—I, not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
46:7:13:And if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.
46:7:14:For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
46:7:15:But if the unbeliever leaves, let them go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound. God has called us to live in peace.
46:7:16:How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
46:7:17:Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer according to the situation the Lord assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.
46:7:18:Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised.
46:7:19:Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.
46:7:20:Each person should remain in the condition they were in when God called them.
46:7:21:Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let that trouble you—but if you can gain your freedom, do so.
46:7:22:For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ's slave.
46:7:23:You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.
46:7:24:Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
46:7:25:Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
46:7:26:Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
46:7:27:Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife.
46:7:28:But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
46:7:29:What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not;
46:7:30:those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
46:7:31:those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.
46:7:32:I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs—how he can please the Lord.
46:7:33:But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—
46:7:34:and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband.
46:7:35:I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
46:7:36:If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.
46:7:37:But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing.
46:7:38:So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.
46:7:39:A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.
46:7:40:In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
46:8:1:Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
46:8:2:If anyone thinks they know something, they don't yet know as they ought to know.
46:8:3:But if someone loves God, they are known by Him.
46:8:4:So, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We understand that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God but one.
46:8:5:Even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"),
46:8:6:For us, there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were made and through whom we exist.
46:8:7:However, not everyone has this knowledge. Some people, still influenced by their former association with idols, eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
46:8:8:Food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
46:8:9:But be careful that your freedom does not become a stumbling block for the weak.
46:8:10:For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, who have this knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, won't they be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?
46:8:11:So by your knowledge, the weak person is destroyed—the brother or sister for whom Christ died.
46:8:12:When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
46:8:13:Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
46:9:1:Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?
46:9:2:If to others I am not an apostle, at least to you I am—for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
46:9:3:This is my defense to those who would examine me.
46:9:4:Don't we have the right to eat and drink?
46:9:5:Or can't we bring along a believing wife, as do the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas?
46:9:6:Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
46:9:7:What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating its fruit? Or who tends a flock without drinking from the milk?
46:9:8:Do I say this based on human authority? Doesn't the Law also say the same?
46:9:9:For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
46:9:10:Or does he say this entirely for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman should plow in hope, and the thresher should thresh in hope of sharing the harvest.
46:9:11:If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you?
46:9:12:If others share this rightful claim on you, don't we even more? Nevertheless, we haven't made use of this right; instead, we endure everything so that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
46:9:13:Don't you know that those who perform the sacred services eat from the temple offerings, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
46:9:14:In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
46:9:15:But I have not used any of these rights, nor am I writing this so it will be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.
46:9:16:For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am compelled to do so—woe to me if I don't preach the gospel!
46:9:17:If I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.
46:9:18:What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may present it free of charge, not making full use of my rights in the gospel.
46:9:19:Though I am free from all people, I have made myself a servant to everyone, in order to win more of them.
46:9:20:To the Jews, I became like a Jew, to win Jews; to those under the law, I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), to win those under the law.
46:9:21:To those without the law, I became like one without the law (though I am not free from God's law but under Christ's law), to win those without the law.
46:9:22:To the weak, I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I might save some.
46:9:23:And I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.
46:9:24:Don't you know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to win the prize.
46:9:25:Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable one.
46:9:26:So I run with purpose in every step; I am not just shadowboxing.
46:9:27:Instead, I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
46:10:1:Now, I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea.
46:10:2:They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
46:10:3:Furthermore, they all ate the same spiritual food,
46:10:4:and drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
46:10:5:But with most of them, God was not pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
46:10:6:These events happened as examples for us, so we wouldn't crave evil things like they did.
46:10:7:Don't be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to indulge in revelry."
46:10:8:Let's not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day 23,000 of them died.
46:10:9:We must not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.
46:10:10:And don't grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the Destroyer.
46:10:11:These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come.
46:10:12:So, whoever thinks they stand firm should be careful not to fall.
46:10:13:No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
46:10:14:So, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
46:10:15:I speak to you as sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
46:10:16:The cup of blessing that we bless, isn't it a sharing in the blood of Christ? And the bread that we break, isn't it a sharing in the body of Christ?
46:10:17:Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.
46:10:18:Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
46:10:19:Do I mean that food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
46:10:20:No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be participants with demons.
46:10:21:You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons.
46:10:22:Are we trying to provoke the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
46:10:23:"Everything is permissible," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible," but not everything builds up.
46:10:24:Let no one seek their own good, but the good of others.
46:10:25:Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
46:10:26:for, "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it."
46:10:27:If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
46:10:28:But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience.
46:10:29:I'm referring to the other person's conscience, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?
46:10:30:If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
46:10:31:So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
46:10:32:Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—
46:10:33:just as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
46:11:1:Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions just as I passed them on to you.
46:11:2:But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.
46:11:3:Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
46:11:4:In contrast, every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it's as if her head were shaved.
46:11:5:If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.
46:11:6:A man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
46:11:7:For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;
46:11:8:Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
46:11:9:That's why a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
46:11:10:However, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
46:11:11:For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
46:11:12:Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
46:11:13:Doesn't nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,
46:11:14:But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
46:11:15:If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God.
46:11:16:In the following directives, I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.
46:11:17:First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.
46:11:18:No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.
46:11:19:So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,
46:11:20:For when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
46:11:21:Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!
46:11:22:For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
46:11:23:And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."
46:11:24:In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."
46:11:25:For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
46:11:26:So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
46:11:27:Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
46:11:28:For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
46:11:29:That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
46:11:30:If we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.
46:11:31:Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
46:11:32:So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.
46:11:33:Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so
46:11:34:that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give further instructions.
46:12:1:Now, about spiritual gifts, my friends, I want you to be well-informed.
46:12:2:You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.
46:12:3:So I'm telling you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
46:12:4:Different gifts are given, but they all come from the same Spirit.
46:12:5:There are various ways to serve, but it's the same Lord we serve.
46:12:6:And there are different workings, but it's the same God who works in all of them.
46:12:7:To each person, the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
46:12:8:For one, the Spirit gives wisdom through words; for another, knowledge through the same Spirit;
46:12:9:to another, faith by the same Spirit; to someone else, gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
46:12:10:to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; and to another, interpretation of tongues.
46:12:11:All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who distributes them to each person as He wills.
46:12:12:Just as a body has many parts, but remains one body, so too is Christ.
46:12:13:Through one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
46:12:14:The body isn't made up of just one part, but of many.
46:12:15:If the foot were to say, "Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body," it would still be part of the body.
46:12:16:And if the ear said, "Because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body," it would still be part of the body.
46:12:17:If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
46:12:18:But in fact, God has placed each part in the body just as He wanted it to be.
46:12:19:If all parts were the same, where would the body be?
46:12:20:As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
46:12:21:The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" Nor can the head say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
46:12:22:On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem weaker are indispensable,
46:12:23:and the parts we consider less honorable, we treat with special honor. Our presentable parts don't need special treatment, but God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
46:12:24:so that there should be no division in the body, and its parts should have equal concern for each other.
46:12:25:If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
46:12:26:Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
46:12:27:In the church, God has appointed first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, guidance, and various kinds of tongues.
46:12:28:Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
46:12:29:Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
46:12:30:But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
46:13:1:If I speak with the eloquence of humans and angels but lack love, I am just a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
46:13:2:And if I have the gift of prophecy, understanding all mysteries and knowledge, and possess faith strong enough to move mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.
46:13:3:Even if I give away everything I own to the poor and sacrifice my body to be burned, without love, it gains me nothing.
46:13:4:Love is patient and kind; it doesn't envy or boast and isn't arrogant.
46:13:5:It does not behave rudely, doesn't seek its own interests, isn't easily angered, and keeps no record of wrongs.
46:13:6:Love doesn't delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth.
46:13:7:It always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres.
46:13:8:Love never fails. Prophecies will cease, tongues will fall silent, and knowledge will pass away.
46:13:9:For we know only in part and prophesy in part,
46:13:10:but when perfection comes, the imperfect will disappear.
46:13:11:When I was a child, I spoke, thought, and reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult, I put away childish things.
46:13:12:Now we see only a reflection, as in a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I am fully known.
46:13:13:So now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
46:14:1:Pursue love, and be eager for spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.
46:14:2:For those who speak in tongues do not communicate to people but to God; no one understands them as they speak mysteries through the Spirit.
46:14:3:But those who prophesy strengthen, encourage, and comfort others.
46:14:4:The person who speaks in tongues builds up themselves, while the one who prophesies builds up the church.
46:14:5:I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more so to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless they also interpret, so that the church may be built up.
46:14:6:Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?
46:14:7:Even lifeless instruments like the flute or harp must play distinct notes for the melody to be recognized.
46:14:8:If a trumpet sounds unclear, who will prepare for battle?
46:14:9:Similarly, if your tongue produces an indistinct sound, how will anyone understand what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
46:14:10:There are many languages in the world, and each has meaning.
46:14:11:But if I don't understand the language, I'll be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.
46:14:12:So, since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.
46:14:13:Therefore, let those who speak in tongues pray for the ability to interpret.
46:14:14:If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
46:14:15:What should I do then? I will pray with my spirit, but also with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but also with my mind.
46:14:16:Otherwise, if you praise God with your spirit, how can those who don't understand say "Amen" to your thanksgiving? They won't know what you're saying.
46:14:17:You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
46:14:18:I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you,
46:14:19:but in the church, I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46:14:20:Brothers and sisters, do not be childish in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but mature in your thinking.
46:14:21:In the Law it is written: "With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners, I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
46:14:22:Tongues, then, are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.
46:14:23:If the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and uninformed or unbelieving visitors come in, won't they say you are out of your minds?
46:14:24:But if an unbeliever or uninformed person comes in while everyone is prophesying, they will be convicted and called to account by all,
46:14:25:and the secrets of their hearts will be laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is truly among you!"
46:14:26:What should you do then, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Everything should be done to build up the church.
46:14:27:If anyone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or at most three, and take turns speaking, with one person interpreting.
46:14:28:But if there is no interpreter, the speaker should remain silent in the church and speak only to themselves and God.
46:14:29:Let two or three prophets speak, while others weigh what is said.
46:14:30:If a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.
46:14:31:For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
46:14:32:The spirits of the prophets are subject to the control of the prophets.
46:14:33:For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the churches
46:14:34:Women should remain silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but must be submissive, as the law says.
46:14:35:If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
46:14:36:Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
46:14:37:If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.
46:14:38:But if anyone ignores this, they themselves will be ignored.
46:14:39:Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
46:14:40:But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
46:15:1:Now, I want to remind you, my friends, about the gospel I preached to you. You received it and stand firm in it.
46:15:2:Through this gospel, you are saved, if you hold fast to the message I taught you; otherwise, your faith would be in vain.
46:15:3:What I passed on to you as most important was what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
46:15:4:that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures foretold.
46:15:5:Afterward, he appeared to Peter, then to the twelve apostles.
46:15:6:Later, he appeared to more than five hundred believers at once, most of whom are still alive today, though some have passed away.
46:15:7:Next, he appeared to James, then to all the other apostles.
46:15:8:Finally, he appeared to me too, even though I'm like someone born at the wrong time.
46:15:9:I am the least of the apostles and don't deserve to be called one because I persecuted God's church.
46:15:10:But by God's grace, I am what I am, and his grace toward me wasn't wasted. Instead, I worked harder than all the other apostles—though not I, but the grace of God with me.
46:15:11:Whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
46:15:12:Now, if we proclaim that Christ was raised from the dead, how can some among you say there's no resurrection of the dead?
46:15:13:If there's no resurrection, then Christ hasn't been raised either.
46:15:14:And if Christ hasn't been raised, our preaching is useless and your faith is pointless.
46:15:15:We would be found to be false witnesses about God because we testified that he raised Christ, whom he didn't raise if the dead aren't resurrected.
46:15:16:If the dead aren't raised, then Christ wasn't raised either.
46:15:17:And if Christ wasn't raised, your faith is futile, and you're still in your sins.
46:15:18:Moreover, those who have died believing in Christ are lost.
46:15:19:If our hope in Christ is for this life only, we are the most pitiable people of all.
46:15:20:But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
46:15:21:Since death came through a man, resurrection also comes through a man.
46:15:22:For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
46:15:23:But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.
46:15:24:Afterward, the end will come when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after destroying all dominion, authority, and power.
46:15:25:For Christ must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet.
46:15:26:The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
46:15:27:For Scripture says, "God has put everything under his feet." Now when it says "everything," it's clear this doesn't include God himself, who put everything under Christ.
46:15:28:When everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself will be made subject to the One who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
46:15:29:Otherwise, what will those people do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
46:15:30:And why do we risk our lives every hour?
46:15:31:I face death daily, as surely as my pride in you, my fellow believers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
46:15:32:If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with only human hope, what have I gained? If the dead aren't raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
46:15:33:Don't be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good character."
46:15:34:Come back to your senses and stop sinning, for some of you don't even know God. I say this to your shame.
46:15:35:But someone might ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?"
46:15:36:How foolish! What you sow doesn't come to life unless it dies.
46:15:37:When you sow, you don't plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else.
46:15:38:But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.
46:15:39:Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another.
46:15:40:There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly is one kind, and the earthly another.
46:15:41:The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.
46:15:42:So it is with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, but it's raised imperishable;
46:15:43:sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;
46:15:44:sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body. If there's a natural body, there's also a spiritual body.
46:15:45:So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.
46:15:46:The spiritual didn't come first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.
46:15:47:The first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven.
46:15:48:As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
46:15:49:Just as we've borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man.
46:15:50:I declare to you, my friends, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
46:15:51:Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—
46:15:52:in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
46:15:53:For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
46:15:54:When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory."
46:15:55:"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
46:15:56:The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
46:15:57:But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
46:15:58:Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, immovable, always excelling in the Lord's work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
46:16:1:Now, concerning the collection for the saints, as I have directed the churches of Galatia, you should do the same.
46:16:2:On the first day of each week, let each of you set aside a portion of your income, storing it up, so there won't be a need to collect funds when I come.
46:16:3:When I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of introduction to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
46:16:4:If it seems appropriate for me to go as well, they can accompany me on my journey.
46:16:5:I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, as I plan to travel through that region.
46:16:6:It's possible that I may stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so you can help me on my journey wherever I go.
46:16:7:For now, I don't want to see you only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.
46:16:8:But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,
46:16:9:because a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many adversaries.
46:16:10:If Timothy comes, make sure he feels welcome among you, because he is doing the Lord's work, just like I am.
46:16:11:Don't let anyone treat him with disrespect. Send him on his way in peace so he can return to me, for I'm waiting for him along with the other believers.
46:16:12:As for our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not at all willing to do so now. He will come when he has the opportunity.
46:16:13:Stay alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous, and be strong.
46:16:14:Let everything you do be done in love.
46:16:15:You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to serving the saints. I urge you,
46:16:16:to submit yourselves to people like them and to everyone who works and labors with them.
46:16:17:I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have made up for your absence.
46:16:18:They have refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such people.
46:16:19:The churches in Asia send their greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, along with the church that meets in their home.
46:16:20:All the brothers and sisters here send their greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
46:16:21:I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
46:16:22:If anyone does not love the Lord, let them be cursed. Come, Lord!
46:16:23:The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
46:16:24:My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
