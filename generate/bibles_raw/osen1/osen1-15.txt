15:1:1:In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia's reign, to fulfill the Lord's prophecy spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord stirred the heart of Cyrus to issue a proclamation throughout his kingdom and also put it in writing:
15:1:2:"This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build a temple for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
15:1:3:All of you who belong to His people, may your God be with you! You are free to go to Jerusalem in Judah and rebuild the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, who is the God in Jerusalem.
15:1:4:To anyone who chooses to stay in any place where they now live, let the people of that place provide them with silver, gold, goods, livestock, and freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem."
15:1:5:Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone whose spirit God had stirred—prepared to go up and rebuild the house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
15:1:6:All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver, gold, goods, livestock, and valuable gifts, as well as freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.
15:1:7:King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and placed in the temple of his gods.
15:1:8:Cyrus, king of Persia, entrusted these items to Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
15:1:9:The inventory included: 30 gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes, 29 silver pans,
15:1:10:30 gold bowls, 410 matching silver bowls, and 1,000 other articles.
15:1:11:In total, there were 5,400 articles of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles went from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15:2:1:After the exile, these are the people who returned from captivity in Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah. Each one went back to their own town.
15:2:2:The leaders included Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of Israelites who returned is as follows:
15:2:3:The descendants of Parosh: 2,172.

15:2:41:The singers from the family of Asaph: 128.
15:2:42:Among the gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai: 139.
15:2:43:The temple servants included: the descendants of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,

15:2:46:Hagab, Shamlai, Hanan,
15:2:47:Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah,
15:2:48:Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam,
15:2:49:Uzza, Paseah, Besai,
15:2:50:Asnah, Meunim, Nephusim,
15:2:51:Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,
15:2:52:Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha,
15:2:53:Barkos, Sisera, Temah,
15:2:54:Naziah, and Hatipha.
15:2:55:The descendants of Solomon's servants included: Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,
15:2:56:Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel,
15:2:57:Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth-Hazzebaim, and Ami.
15:2:58:In total, the temple servants and descendants of Solomon's servants numbered 392.
15:2:59:Some people could not prove their ancestry or lineage. These included the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda: 642.
15:2:60:Among the priests, these families could not prove their lineage: Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and took her name).
15:2:61:They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found. Consequently, they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.
15:2:62:The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy food until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
15:2:63:The entire assembly that returned from exile totaled 42,360.
15:2:64:This number did not include their male and female servants, who numbered 7,337. They also had 200 male and female singers.
15:2:65:Their horses numbered 736, their mules 245,
15:2:66:their camels 435, and their donkeys 6,720.
15:2:67:When they arrived at the Lord's temple in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders made freewill offerings for the rebuilding of the temple on its original site.
15:2:68:According to their ability, they gave gold, silver, and other items for the work. The total included 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly garments.
15:2:69:The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all the people settled in their own towns, and the rest of Israel did the same.
15:3:1:In the seventh month, after the Israelites had settled in their towns, they all gathered together as one in Jerusalem.
15:3:2:Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests, along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates, began to rebuild the altar of the God of Israel so they could offer burnt offerings on it, as instructed in the Law of Moses, the man of God.
15:3:3:Despite their fear of the people from the surrounding lands, they built the altar on its original site and offered burnt offerings to the Lord, both morning and evening.
15:3:4:They also celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles, as written in the law, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom, day by day.
15:3:5:After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices, and the offerings for all the appointed sacred festivals of the Lord, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the Lord.
15:3:6:From the first day of the seventh month, they started offering burnt offerings to the Lord, although the foundation of the Lord's temple had not yet been laid.
15:3:7:They gave money to the masons and carpenters, and provided food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
15:3:8:In the second year of their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers—the priests, the Levites, and all who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem—began the work.
15:3:9:They appointed Levites who were twenty years old and older to supervise the construction of the Lord's house. Jeshua and his sons and brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, and the sons of Judah, together took charge of the workers in the house of God.
15:3:10:When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord according to the directions given by King David of Israel.
15:3:11:They sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the Lord, saying, "For He is good; His steadfast love toward Israel endures forever." And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
15:3:12:But many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.
15:3:13:No one could distinguish the sound of the joyful shouting from the sound of the weeping, because the people made so much noise. The sound was heard far away.
15:4:1:When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel,
15:4:2:they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families and said, "Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."
15:4:3:But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of Israel's families replied, "It is not for you to build a house for our God. We alone will build it for the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us."
15:4:4:Then the people around them tried to discourage and frighten the people of Judah, to keep them from building.
15:4:5:They also bribed officials to work against them and frustrate their plans throughout the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15:4:6:During the reign of Xerxes, in the beginning of his reign, they lodged an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
15:4:7:Later, in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language.
15:4:8:Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote another letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
15:4:9:From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues—the judges, officials, administrators, and the people from Persia, Uruk, Babylon, Susa (that is, the Elamites),
15:4:10:and the other nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River.
15:4:11:This is a copy of the letter they sent to King Artaxerxes: "To King Artaxerxes, from your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River:
15:4:12:We wish to inform the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have arrived in Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are completing its walls and repairing its foundations.
15:4:13:Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal treasury will suffer loss.
15:4:14:Since we are loyal to the king and it is not right for us to see the king dishonored, we have sent this message to inform the king,
15:4:15:so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records, you will find that this city has a history of rebellion against kings and has been a place of revolt and sedition.
15:4:16:We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, you will lose control of the province Beyond the River."
15:4:17:The king sent this reply: "To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues living in Samaria and elsewhere in the province Beyond the River: Greetings.
15:4:18:The letter you sent us has been translated and read in my presence.
15:4:19:I ordered a search to be made, and it has been found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.
15:4:20:Powerful kings have ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over the whole province Beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll were paid to them.
15:4:21:Now issue an order for these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I give further notice.
15:4:22:Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why should the situation worsen to the detriment of the royal interests?"
15:4:23:As soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they hurried to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop construction.
15:4:24:Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15:5:1:At this time, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, both prophets, began to prophesy to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
15:5:2:So Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up and started to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And with them were the prophets of God, helping and supporting them.
15:5:3:During this period, Tattenai the governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates approached the builders and asked them, "Who gave you permission to rebuild this temple and restore its structure?"
15:5:4:They also requested the names of the men responsible for this construction work.
15:5:5:But the watchful eye of their God was on the Jewish elders, and they were not stopped until a report could be sent to Darius and an official response received.
15:5:6:Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, following their instructions, sent a letter to King Darius.
15:5:7:The message they sent read as follows: "To King Darius, all peace. 
15:5:8:We wish to inform the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the great house of God. It is being built with large stones, and timber is laid in the walls. The work is being carried out diligently and is making good progress under their direction.
15:5:9:We questioned the elders and asked them, 'Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore its structure?'
15:5:10:Additionally, we asked for their names so that we could inform you and write down the names of the men leading this project.
15:5:11:In response, they told us, 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel constructed and completed.
15:5:12:However, because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and exiled the people to Babylon.
15:5:13:Yet in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, he issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
15:5:14:He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver vessels belonging to the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus returned these items to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor.
15:5:15:Cyrus instructed him to take these vessels and place them in the temple in Jerusalem, and to rebuild the house of God on its original site.
15:5:16:So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that time until now it has been under construction, but it is not yet finished.'
15:5:17:Now, if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the royal archives of Babylon to verify whether King Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his decision concerning this matter."
15:6:1:Darius the king issued a decree, and a search was conducted in the royal archives where treasures were stored in Babylon.
15:6:2:A scroll was found in Ecbatana, the capital of the province of Media, and it contained this memorandum:
15:6:3:"In the first year of King Cyrus, he commanded the rebuilding of God's house in Jerusalem, which is to be a place for offering sacrifices, with a solid foundation. Its height should be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits,
15:6:4:with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. The cost will be paid from the king's treasury.
15:6:5:Furthermore, the gold and silver articles belonging to God's house, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned and placed back in the temple in Jerusalem where they belong."
15:6:6:So King Darius sent this message: "Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your fellow officials beyond the River, stay away from there.
15:6:7:Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its original site.
15:6:8:I hereby issue a decree concerning what you must do to help these Jewish elders rebuild the house of God: The full cost is to be paid to these men from the royal treasury out of the taxes collected from the region beyond the River, so that the work is not hindered.
15:6:9:Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, or lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be provided daily without fail,
15:6:10:so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
15:6:11:I also decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled from their house, and they shall be impaled on it. And their house shall be made a pile of rubble for this offense.
15:6:12:May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempt to change this command or destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree; let it be carried out with diligence."
15:6:13:Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their fellow officials complied at once with the order issued by King Darius.
15:6:14:The Jewish elders continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
15:6:15:The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15:6:16:The people of Israel—the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
15:6:17:For the dedication of this house of God, they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
15:6:18:They also appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their orders, for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses.
15:6:19:The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
15:6:20:The priests and Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were ceremonially clean. They slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
15:6:21:The Israelites who had returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, sought the Lord, the God of Israel.
15:6:22:They joyfully celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, for the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the heart of the king of Assyria to strengthen their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel.
15:7:1:In the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra, son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
15:7:2:descended from Zadok, Ahitub, Amariah, and Azariah, tracing his lineage back to Meraioth,
15:7:3:son of Zerahiah, Uzzi, Bukki, and Abishua, a descendant of Phinehas, Eleazar, and Aaron the chief priest.
15:7:4:Ezra came up from Babylon, and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king granted him everything he requested because the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.
15:7:5:In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants, went up to Jerusalem with Ezra.
15:7:6:They arrived in Jerusalem during the fifth month of the seventh year of the king's reign.
15:7:7:From the first day of the first month, they began their journey from Babylon, and by the first day of the fifth month, they reached Jerusalem, for the gracious hand of their God was on them.
15:7:8:Ezra had set his heart on studying the Law of the LORD, practicing it, and teaching its statutes and ordinances in Israel.
15:7:9:This is the text of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a man learned in matters concerning the commandments of the LORD and His statutes for Israel:
15:7:10:"Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Peace. And now,
15:7:11:I hereby decree that any of the people of Israel, including priests and Levites in my kingdom, who are willing to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.
15:7:12:You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your possession.
15:7:13:Moreover, you are to carry the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15:7:14:along with all the silver and gold you find in the whole province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings given by the people and priests for the house of their God in Jerusalem.
15:7:15:With this money, carefully purchase bulls, rams, lambs, along with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.
15:7:16:Whatever else is needed for the house of your God, which you have responsibility for, you may provide from the royal treasury.
15:7:17:I, King Artaxerxes, hereby order all the treasurers in the region west of the Euphrates River to provide Ezra the priest, scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, with whatever he requests of you,
15:7:18:up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without limit.
15:7:19:Let everything be done for the house of the God of heaven, so that wrath may not come upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.
15:7:20:Furthermore, be advised that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute, or duty on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other workers in this house of God.
15:7:21:Now I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers in the region west of the Euphrates River: Whatever Ezra the priest, scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, asks of you, let it be done with diligence,
15:7:22:up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without limit.
15:7:23:Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be carried out diligently for His house. Why should His wrath fall upon the realm of the king and his sons?
15:7:24:You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute, or duty on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other workers in this house of God.
15:7:25:And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your possession, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people in the region west of the Euphrates River—all those who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach anyone who does not know them.
15:7:26:Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must face strict judgment, whether it be death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
15:7:27:Praise be to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the heart of the king to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem,
15:7:28:and who has extended His gracious favor to me before the king and his advisers, and before all the king's mighty officials. Strengthened by the LORD my God, I gathered Israelite leaders to return with me.
15:8:1:These are the family heads and their genealogical records who went up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
15:8:2:From the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; from the descendants of David, Hattush,
15:8:3:from the descendants of Shecaniah; from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
15:8:4:from the descendants of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
15:8:5:from the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
15:8:6:from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
15:8:7:from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
15:8:8:from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
15:8:9:from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
15:8:10:from the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
15:8:11:from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
15:8:12:from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
15:8:13:from the descendants of Adonikam, the younger ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
15:8:14:from the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai son of Istalcurus, and with him 70 men.
15:8:15:I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found no Levites among them.
15:8:16:So I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan.
15:8:17:I sent them to Iddo, the leader at the place called Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they would bring us ministers for the house of our God.
15:8:18:Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, totaling 18 men;
15:8:19:and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, totaling 20 men.
15:8:20:They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a group David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
15:8:21:There by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
15:8:22:I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to Him, but His great anger is against all who forsake Him."
15:8:23:So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and He answered our prayer.
15:8:24:I set apart twelve of the leading priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers—
15:8:25:and I weighed out to them the offering of silver, gold, and articles that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.
15:8:26:I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
15:8:27:20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.
15:8:28:I said to them, "You are consecrated to the Lord, and these articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord God of your ancestors.
15:8:29:Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem before the leading priests, the Levites, and the family heads of Israel."
15:8:30:So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the articles that had been weighed out, to bring them to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
15:8:31:On the twelfth day of the first month, we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and He protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.
15:8:32:So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.
15:8:33:On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, as well as the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
15:8:34:Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
15:8:35:Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.
15:8:36:They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and governors of the provinces beyond the River, who then supported the people and the house of God.
15:9:1:When these things were done, Ezra the priest received a report about the people of Israel, their priests, and the Levites, that they had not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
15:9:2:Indeed, Israelite men had married women from these foreign nations, and in doing so, they mingled the holy race with the people around them. The leaders and officials were the foremost in this unfaithfulness.
15:9:3:Hearing this news, I tore my clothes, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in despair.
15:9:4:Many who trembled at the word of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles. I sat there in shock until the evening sacrifice.
15:9:5:At the time of the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, still wearing my torn clothes. I fell on my knees, spread out my hands to the Lord my God,
15:9:6:And prayed, "O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift my face to you, for our sins have piled up higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens.
15:9:7:From the days of our ancestors until now, we have been deep in guilt. Because of our sins, we and our kings and priests have been handed over to foreign kings, subjected to the sword, captivity, plundering, and humiliation, as it is today.
15:9:8:But now, for a brief moment, the Lord our God has shown us grace by allowing a remnant to escape and giving us a secure foothold in His holy place. Our God has brightened our eyes and granted us relief in our slavery.
15:9:9:Though we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our bondage. He has extended kindness to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, providing us with sustenance, reviving our lives, repairing the house of our God, and protecting its ruins, as well as giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
15:9:10:Now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,
15:9:11:Which you gave through your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples and their detestable practices, which have filled it with wickedness from one end to the other.
15:9:12:Do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their peace or prosperity forever, so that you may be strong, enjoy the good things of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.'
15:9:13:After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and immense guilt, even though you, our God, have punished us less than our sins deserved and have allowed us to survive as we do now,
15:9:14:How can we ignore your commandments again and intermarry with these wicked people? Wouldn't you become so angry with us that you would destroy us, leaving no remnant or survivor?
15:9:15:Lord, God of Israel, you are just. We stand before you in our guilt, for there is no one who can stand before you because of this."
15:10:1:At that time, Ezra the priest stood up and said to the people, "You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, which has increased the guilt of Israel.
15:10:2:Now, confess your sins to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the foreign women and their children.
15:10:3:As for us, we will follow the advice you've given and make a covenant with our God to send away these foreign women and their offspring, according to the will of my Lord and those who fear the commandments of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
15:10:4:Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we support you. Be strong and take action."
15:10:5:Then Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel swear to do what had been suggested. So they took the oath.
15:10:6:Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan, son of Eliashib. He stayed there, mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles, without eating food or drinking water.
15:10:7:They circulated a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather in Jerusalem.
15:10:8:Whoever failed to appear within three days, as required by the leaders and elders, would forfeit all their property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
15:10:9:So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, shivering because of the bad weather.
15:10:10:Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel.
15:10:11:Now, confess your sins and give praise to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the foreign women and their children.
15:10:12:The whole assembly responded with a loud voice, "You're right! We must do as you say.
15:10:13:However, there are many people here, and it's the rainy season, so we can't stand outside. Also, this matter can't be resolved in a day or two, for we have sinned greatly in this matter.
15:10:14:Let our leaders represent the whole assembly. Let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at an appointed time, accompanied by the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God over this issue is turned away from us."
15:10:15:Only Jonathan, son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, son of Tikvah, opposed this, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
15:10:16:The exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month, they sat down to investigate the cases.
15:10:17:By the first day of the first month, they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
15:10:18:Among the descendants of the priests, these were found to have married foreign women: From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
15:10:19:They pledged to send away their wives, and as a guilt offering for their error, they each offered a ram from the flock.
15:10:20:From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
15:10:21:From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.

15:10:24:From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
15:10:25:And among the other Israelites: From the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah.
15:10:26:From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.

15:10:28:From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
15:10:29:From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
15:10:30:From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
15:10:31:From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
15:10:32:Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
15:10:33:From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
15:10:34:From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,

15:10:36:Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

15:10:38:Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
15:10:39:Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
15:10:40:Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
15:10:41:Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
15:10:42:Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
15:10:43:From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
15:10:44:All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
