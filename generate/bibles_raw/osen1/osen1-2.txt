2:1:1:These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
2:1:2:Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
2:1:3:Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
2:1:4:Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
2:1:5:The total number of Jacob's descendants was seventy; Joseph was already in Egypt.
2:1:6:Eventually, Joseph and all his brothers died, as well as that entire generation.
2:1:7:But the Israelites were fruitful, multiplied greatly, and became extremely numerous, so the land was filled with them.
2:1:8:A new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
2:1:9:He said to his people, "The Israelites have become too numerous and strong for us.
2:1:10:We must act wisely to prevent them from growing even more powerful; otherwise, they might join our enemies in war and then escape from the country."
2:1:11:So the Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh labor, making them build cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Rameses.
2:1:12:But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, causing the Egyptians to fear the Israelites even more.
2:1:13:Egyptians made their lives bitter by imposing cruel tasks on them, forcing them to work with clay and bricks, and in all kinds of field labor.
2:1:14:They ruthlessly exploited the Israelites in their work.
2:1:15:Then the Egyptian king told the Hebrew midwives, one named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
2:1:16:"When you help the Hebrew women give birth, watch as they deliver. If it's a boy, kill him; but if it's a girl, let her live."
2:1:17:However, the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had ordered; they let the boys live.
2:1:18:The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this, allowing the boys to live?"
2:1:19:The midwives replied, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they give birth quickly before we can even get there."
2:1:20:Because the midwives feared God, He blessed them with families of their own.
2:1:21:And as the Israelites continued to multiply, they became even more numerous.
2:1:22:Finally, Pharaoh issued a command to all his people: "Every Hebrew boy that is born must be thrown into the Nile, but let every girl live."
2:2:1:A man from the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman.
2:2:2:The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Seeing that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.
2:2:3:When she could no longer hide him, she made a basket out of papyrus, sealed it with tar and pitch, and placed the baby inside. Then she put the basket among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River.
2:2:4:His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
2:2:5:Pharaoh's daughter came down to the Nile to bathe, while her attendants walked along the riverbank. She noticed the basket among the reeds and sent her servant girl to get it.
2:2:6:She opened the basket and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This must be one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
2:2:7:Then the baby's sister approached Pharaoh's daughter and asked, "Would you like me to find a Hebrew nurse to nurse the baby for you?"
2:2:8:Pharaoh's daughter agreed, "Go ahead." So the girl went and brought the baby's mother.
2:2:9:Pharaoh's daughter told the woman, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." The woman took the baby and nursed him.
2:2:10:When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
2:2:11:One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and saw their hard labor. He witnessed an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
2:2:12:Looking around and seeing no one, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
2:2:13:The next day, he went out again and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one who started the fight, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
2:2:14:The man replied, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, realizing that his secret was known.
2:2:15:When Pharaoh heard about this incident, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.
2:2:16:Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.
2:2:17:Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped the women and watered their flock.
2:2:18:When they returned to their father Reuel, he asked, "Why have you come back so early today?"
2:2:19:They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
2:2:20:Reuel said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."
2:2:21:Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
2:2:22:Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land."
2:2:23:During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help rose up to God.
2:2:24:God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
2:2:25:God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
2:3:1:One day, Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
2:3:2:There, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but did not burn up.
2:3:3:Curious about this strange sight, he thought, "I'll go over and see why the bush isn't being consumed by the flames."
2:3:4:When the Lord noticed Moses approaching, He called out to him from the bush, "Moses! Moses!" Moses replied, "Here I am."
2:3:5:God said, "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
2:3:6:Then He continued, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.
2:3:7:The Lord said, "I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cries and know their pain; I am aware of their oppression.
2:3:8:I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and bring them to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2:3:9:Now, the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
2:3:10:So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."
2:3:11:Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
2:3:12:God answered, "I will be with you. This will be the sign that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship me on this mountain."
2:3:13:Moses asked, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"
2:3:14:God replied, "I AM WHO I AM. Tell the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
2:3:15:God also told Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
2:3:16:Go, gather the elders of Israel and tell them, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers, appeared to me—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and said, I have been watching over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
2:3:17:I have promised to rescue you from your oppression in Egypt and bring you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'
2:3:18:The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.'
2:3:19:But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
2:3:20:So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
2:3:21:I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And when you leave, you will not go empty-handed.
2:3:22:Every woman should ask her Egyptian neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. In this way, you will plunder the Egyptians."
2:4:1:Moses answered, "But what if they don't believe me or listen to my voice? What if they say, 'The Lord didn't appear to you'?"
2:4:2:Then the Lord said to him, "What is that in your hand?" Moses replied, "A staff."
2:4:3:The Lord instructed, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses stepped back from it.
2:4:4:God told Moses, "Reach out your hand and grab it by the tail." He reached out, grabbed it, and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
2:4:5:"This sign will help them believe that the Lord, the God of their ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to you."
2:4:6:Next, the Lord said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." Moses did as he was told, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow.
2:4:7:"Now put your hand back inside your cloak," said the Lord. Moses obeyed, and when he pulled it out again, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
2:4:8:"If they don't believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second one.
2:4:9:But if they still don't believe these two signs or listen to your voice, take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will turn into blood on the ground."
2:4:10:Moses spoke up, "Please, Lord, I've never been eloquent, not in the past nor since you started speaking to me. My words come out slow and my tongue feels clumsy."
2:4:11:The Lord replied, "Who gave humans their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute, sighted or blind? Isn't it I, the Lord?
2:4:12:Now go! I will help you speak, and I'll teach you what to say."
2:4:13:Moses hesitated, "Please, Lord, send someone else."
2:4:14:Then the Lord's anger burned against Moses, and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He's already on his way to meet you, and he'll be happy to see you.
2:4:15:You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and teach you what to do.
2:4:16:Aaron will be your spokesman to the people. He will be your mouthpiece, and you will be like God to him.
2:4:17:Take this staff in your hand so that you can perform miraculous signs with it."
2:4:18:So Moses returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, "Let me go back to my relatives in Egypt to see if they're still alive." Jethro replied, "Go in peace."
2:4:19:In Midian, the Lord told Moses, "Return to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead."
2:4:20:Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to Egypt. He carried the staff of God in his hand.
2:4:21:The Lord instructed Moses, "When you return to Egypt, perform all the wonders I've given you the power to do before Pharaoh. But I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.
2:4:22:Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,
2:4:23:and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.'"
2:4:24:On the way, at a lodging place, the Lord confronted Moses and was about to kill him.
2:4:25:But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin, and touched Moses' feet with it. She said, "You are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
2:4:26:So the Lord let him alone. At that time she said, "A bridegroom of blood," referring to the circumcision.
2:4:27:The Lord told Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went and met him at the mountain of God, and they embraced each other.
2:4:28:Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say, and about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.
2:4:29:Moses and Aaron gathered all the elders of the Israelites,
2:4:30:and Aaron relayed everything the Lord had spoken to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
2:4:31:and they believed. When they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
2:5:1:Afterward, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has instructed us: 'Allow my people to go and hold a festival for me in the wilderness.'"
2:5:2:Pharaoh replied, "Who is this LORD that I should obey him and let Israel go? I don't know the LORD, and I won't release Israel."
2:5:3:They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. Otherwise, he might strike us with plagues or with the sword."
2:5:4:The Egyptian king said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to your labor!"
2:5:5:Pharaoh continued, "Look, there are already too many people in the land, and you want them to stop working?"
2:5:6:That same day, Pharaoh ordered the slave drivers and overseers of the people:
2:5:7:"You must no longer provide straw for the people to make bricks as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
2:5:8:But require them to produce the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce it. They are lazy; that's why they're crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
2:5:9:Make their work harder so they pay no attention to these lies."
2:5:10:So the slave drivers and overseers went out and told the people, "Pharaoh says, 'I will not give you any more straw.
2:5:11:Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your daily quota of bricks won't change.'"
2:5:12:The people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
2:5:13:The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete your daily quota of bricks, just as when you had straw."
2:5:14:The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and asked, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"
2:5:15:Then the Israelite foremen went and cried out to Pharaoh, "Why are you treating your servants like this?
2:5:16:No straw is given to us, yet they say, 'Make bricks!' We are being beaten, but it's not our fault. Your own people are responsible!"
2:5:17:Pharaoh replied, "You're lazy, just plain lazy! That's why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
2:5:18:Now get back to work! You won't be given any straw, but you must still produce your full quota of bricks."
2:5:19:The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You must not reduce the number of bricks you make each day."
2:5:20:As they left Pharaoh's presence, they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them.
2:5:21:They said to them, "May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
2:5:22:Moses turned to the LORD and asked, "Why have you brought this trouble on your people? Why did you send me?
2:5:23:Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."
2:6:1:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. Indeed, with a strong hand he will let them go; with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land."
2:6:2:God spoke to Moses and told him, "I am the LORD."
2:6:3:I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name 'the LORD' I was not known to them.
2:6:4:I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.
2:6:5:Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
2:6:6:So say to the Israelites, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
2:6:7:I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
2:6:8:And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"
2:6:9:Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but they were too discouraged and anguished to listen to him because of their harsh labor.
2:6:10:Then the LORD said to Moses,
2:6:11:"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."
2:6:12:But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?"
2:6:13:Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a command for the Israelites and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
2:6:14:These are the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben.
2:6:15:The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon.
2:6:16:These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
2:6:17:The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their families.
2:6:18:The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
2:6:19:The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
2:6:20:Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
2:6:21:The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
2:6:22:The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
2:6:23:Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
2:6:24:The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites.
2:6:25:Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their families.
2:6:26:These are Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the Israelites from the land of Egypt according to their divisions."
2:6:27:They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt; these are Moses and Aaron.
2:6:28:On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
2:6:29:the LORD said to Moses, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you."
2:6:30:But Moses replied, "I am unskilled in speech; how will Pharaoh listen to me?"
2:7:1:The LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like a god to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
2:7:2:You shall speak everything I command you, and Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go from his land.
2:7:3:But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
2:7:4:Pharaoh won't listen to you, so I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments.
2:7:5:The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them."
2:7:6:Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them.
2:7:7:Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
2:7:8:The LORD told Moses and Aaron,
2:7:9:"When Pharaoh asks for a miracle, tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent."
2:7:10:So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent.
2:7:11:Then Pharaoh summoned his wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same thing by their secret arts.
2:7:12:Each one threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
2:7:13:Still, Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
2:7:14:The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
2:7:15:Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent.
2:7:16:Say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness." But until now, you have not listened.
2:7:17:This is what the LORD says: By this, you will know that I am the LORD. With the staff in my hand, I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be turned to blood.
2:7:18:The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"
2:7:19:The LORD told Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, canals, ponds, and all their pools of water—so that they may become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in wooden bowls and stone jars.'"
2:7:20:Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron lifted up his staff and struck the water in the Nile in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, and all the water in the Nile turned to blood.
2:7:21:The fish in the Nile died, the river smelled terrible, and the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
2:7:22:But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart was hardened; he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
2:7:23:Pharaoh turned and went into his palace, and he did not take even this to heart.
2:7:24:All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink the water from the river.
2:7:25:Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
2:8:1:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so they can worship me.
2:8:2:If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs upon your entire country.
2:8:3:The Nile River will teem with frogs. They'll come up into your palace, into your bedroom, and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and even into your ovens and kneading bowls.
2:8:4:The frogs will be all over you, your people, and your officials.'"
2:8:5:Moses then said to the LORD, "Tell Aaron to stretch out his hand with his staff over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt."
2:8:6:Aaron did as he was told, and when he stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and covered the land.
2:8:7:But the magicians of Egypt were able to do the same thing by their secret arts. They also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
2:8:8:Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to remove the frogs from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2:8:9:Moses replied to Pharaoh, "You may choose the time for me to pray for you, your officials, and your people, so that the frogs will be gone from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile."
2:8:10:Pharaoh said, "Tomorrow." Moses responded, "As you wish, so that you may know there's no one like the LORD our God.
2:8:11:The frogs will leave you, your houses, your officials, and your people. They'll remain only in the Nile."
2:8:12:After leaving Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought upon Pharaoh.
2:8:13:And the LORD did as Moses asked; the frogs died in the houses, courtyards, and fields.
2:8:14:They piled them up in heaps, and the land stank.
2:8:15:But when Pharaoh saw that relief had come, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had predicted.
2:8:16:Then the LORD instructed Moses, "Tell Aaron to stretch out his staff and strike the dust of the ground, so that it may become gnats throughout the land of Egypt."
2:8:17:Aaron did as he was told, and when he struck the dust with his staff, gnats came upon people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt turned into gnats.
2:8:18:The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they couldn't. The gnats were on both people and animals.
2:8:19:The magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart remained hard, and he wouldn't listen to them, just as the LORD had predicted.
2:8:20:Next, the LORD told Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river. Tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so they can worship me.
2:8:21:If you don't let my people go, I will send swarms of flies upon you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and the ground will be covered with them.
2:8:22:But on that day, I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people live, so that no swarms of flies will be there. In this way, you'll know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
2:8:23:I will make a distinction between my people and yours. This sign will happen tomorrow.'"
2:8:24:And the LORD did just that. Dense swarms of flies filled Pharaoh's palace and the houses of his officials. The whole land of Egypt was thrown into chaos by the flies.
2:8:25:Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, offer sacrifices to your God here in the land."
2:8:26:Moses replied, "That wouldn't be right. The sacrifices we offer to the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are detestable to them right before their eyes, won't they stone us?
2:8:27:We must travel three days into the wilderness and offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, just as he commands us."
2:8:28:Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but don't go too far away. Now pray for me."
2:8:29:Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will leave Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceitfully again by refusing to let the people go and offer sacrifices to the LORD."
2:8:30:Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
2:8:31:And the LORD did what Moses asked; he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not a single fly remained.
2:8:32:But this time also, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
2:9:1:Then the LORD told Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so they can worship me.
2:9:2:If you continue to refuse to let them go and keep holding them back,
2:9:3:the hand of the LORD will bring a severe plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks.
2:9:4:But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that none belonging to the Israelites will die.'"
2:9:5:The LORD set a time, saying, "Tomorrow, the LORD will do this in the land."
2:9:6:And the next day, the LORD did it. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the animals belonging to the Israelites perished.
2:9:7:Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding, and he would not let the people go.
2:9:8:Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
2:9:9:It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, causing festering boils to break out on people and animals throughout the country."
2:9:10:So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals alike.
2:9:11:The Egyptian magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils affected the magicians as well as all the Egyptians.
2:9:12:But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.
2:9:13:Then the LORD told Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh, and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so they can worship me.
2:9:14:For this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
2:9:15:By now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
2:9:16:But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
2:9:17:You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
2:9:18:Therefore, at this time tomorrow, I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded until now.
2:9:19:Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"
2:9:20:Those among Pharaoh's officials who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
2:9:21:But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
2:9:22:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt."
2:9:23:When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;
2:9:24:hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
2:9:25:Throughout Egypt, the hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
2:9:26:Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail.
2:9:27:Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "This time I have sinned. The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
2:9:28:Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't need to stay any longer."
2:9:29:Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop, and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD's.
2:9:30:But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."
2:9:31:(The flax and barley were destroyed since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
2:9:32:But the wheat and spelt were not destroyed because they ripen later.)
2:9:33:Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
2:9:34:When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.
2:9:35:So Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.
2:10:1:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart stubborn and the hearts of his officials, so that I may show these miraculous signs among them.
2:10:2:You will be able to tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and the great signs I performed among them, so you may know that I am the LORD."
2:10:3:Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so they can worship me.
2:10:4:If you keep refusing to let them go, tomorrow I will bring a swarm of locusts into your territory.
2:10:5:They will cover the ground until it cannot be seen. They will devour all that was left after the hail, including every tree growing in your fields.
2:10:6:They will fill your houses, the homes of your officials, and all the houses of Egypt—something your parents and ancestors never saw from the day they settled here until now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
2:10:7:Pharaoh's officials asked him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so they can worship the LORD their God. Don't you realize that Egypt is ruined?"
2:10:8:So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. He told them, "Go, worship the LORD your God. But exactly who will be going?"
2:10:9:Moses replied, "We will go with our young and old, our sons and daughters, and our flocks and herds because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."
2:10:10:Pharaoh said to them, "The LORD will indeed be with you if I let you and your children go. Clearly, you are plotting evil.
2:10:11:No! Only the men may go and worship the LORD since that's what you asked for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.
2:10:12:The LORD instructed Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."
2:10:13:Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all day and all night. By morning, the wind had brought the locusts.
2:10:14:They invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area, causing great devastation. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor would there ever be again.
2:10:15:They covered the ground until it was black, and they devoured all the plants and fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
2:10:16:Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
2:10:17:Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."
2:10:18:Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
2:10:19:The LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
2:10:20:But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
2:10:21:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—a darkness that can be felt."
2:10:22:Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
2:10:23:No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
2:10:24:Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."
2:10:25:Moses responded, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
2:10:26:Our livestock will also go with us; not a hoof will be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD until we get there."
2:10:27:But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
2:10:28:Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get away from me! Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die."
2:10:29:Moses replied, "Just as you say, I will never appear before you again."
2:11:1:Now the LORD told Moses, "I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he finally lets you go, he will actually drive you out completely.
2:11:2:Speak to the people of Israel and tell them that both men and women should ask their Egyptian neighbors for articles of silver and gold."
2:11:3:The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the Israelites, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.
2:11:4:So Moses announced, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight, I will go throughout Egypt,
2:11:5:and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the livestock as well.
2:11:6:There will be a great cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as there has never been before and never will be again.
2:11:7:But among the Israelites, not even a dog will bark at any person or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.
2:11:8:All these officials of yours will come down to me, bowing before me and saying, 'Leave, you and all the people who follow you!' After that, I will depart." And Moses left Pharaoh's presence in fierce anger.
2:11:9:The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."
2:11:10:Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the Israelites go out of his country.
2:12:1:In Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
2:12:2:"This month will be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year.
2:12:3:Tell the whole Israelite community that on the tenth day of this month, each man must select a lamb or young goat for his family, one per household.
2:12:4:If a household is too small for a whole animal, they should share with their nearest neighbor, taking into account the number of people and what each person can eat.
2:12:5:Choose a healthy, one-year-old male lamb or goat without any defects.
2:12:6:Keep the chosen animal until the fourteenth day of the month, when the entire assembly of Israel will slaughter them at twilight.
2:12:7:Take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and lintel of the houses where they eat the animal.
2:12:8:That night, they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs and unleavened bread.
2:12:9:Do not eat it raw or boiled in water, but roast it over the fire, including its head, legs, and inner parts.
2:12:10:You must not leave any of it until morning; if there is anything left over, burn it.
2:12:11:Eat the meal fully dressed, with your sandals on your feet and your staff in hand. Eat it quickly, as it is the Lord's Passover.
2:12:12:On that night, I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn, both humans and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.
2:12:13:The blood on your houses will be a sign for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
2:12:14:This day will be a lasting memorial for you; celebrate it as a feast to the Lord. Throughout your generations, observe it as a permanent ordinance.
2:12:15:For seven days, you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day, remove all yeast from your homes. Whoever eats anything with yeast during these seven days will be cut off from Israel.
2:12:16:On the first and seventh days, hold a sacred assembly. No work should be done on these days, except for preparing food for everyone to eat.
2:12:17:Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day, I brought your divisions out of Egypt. This is a day you must remember for all time, by observing it throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.
2:12:18:In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day, you must eat unleavened bread.
2:12:19:For seven days, no yeast should be found in your homes. Anyone who eats something with yeast, whether a foreigner or native-born, will be cut off from the community of Israel.
2:12:20:Do not eat anything containing yeast; wherever you live, eat only unleavened bread."
2:12:21:Moses called for all the elders of Israel and told them, "Go at once, select an animal for your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb.
2:12:22:Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and put some of the blood on the top and both sides of the doorframe. None of you should go out of your house until morning.
2:12:23:When the Lord goes through Egypt to strike down the Egyptians, He will see the blood on the doorframe and pass over that house, sparing it from the deadly plague.
2:12:24:Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
2:12:25:When you enter the land the Lord will give you, as He promised, observe this ceremony.
2:12:26:And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'
2:12:27:You shall reply, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when He struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
2:12:28:The Israelites did exactly what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
2:12:29:At midnight, the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock.
2:12:30:Pharaoh and all his officials, along with all the Egyptians, got up during the night, and there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
2:12:31:During the night, Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Get up and leave my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord as you have requested.
2:12:32:Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."
2:12:33:The Egyptians urged the Israelites to leave quickly, saying, "We are all going to die!"
2:12:34:So the people took their dough before the yeast was added and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
2:12:35:The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver, gold, and clothing.
2:12:36:The Lord made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
2:12:37:The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
2:12:38:Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
2:12:39:With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food with yeast.
2:12:40:The time the Israelites spent in Egypt was 430 years.
2:12:41:At the end of the 430 years, on that very day, all the Lord's divisions left Egypt.
2:12:42:This night is to be observed as a vigil to honor the Lord for bringing them out of Egypt. This is a night of vigil for all the Israelites throughout their generations.
2:12:43:The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover meal: No foreigner may eat it.
2:12:44:However, any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him.
2:12:45:A temporary resident or a hired worker shall not eat it.
2:12:46:It must be eaten inside one house; do not take any of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of its bones.
2:12:47:The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
2:12:48:If a foreigner residing among you wants to celebrate the Lord's Passover, all the males in his household must be circumcised; then he may participate like a native-born Israelite. No uncircumcised male may eat it.
2:12:49:The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you."
2:12:50:All the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
2:12:51:And on that very day, the Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
2:13:1:God spoke to Moses, saying,
2:13:2:"Dedicate every firstborn to me, both humans and animals; they are mine."
2:13:3:Moses told the people, "Remember this day when you left Egypt, the land of slavery, because the Lord brought you out of there with a strong hand. Do not eat any bread made with yeast.
2:13:4:Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
2:13:5:When the Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which he promised to your ancestors, you shall celebrate this ceremony in that land.
2:13:6:For seven days, you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, there will be a festival to the Lord.
2:13:7:Only unleavened bread should be eaten during these seven days; nothing with yeast should be seen among you, nor within your borders.
2:13:8:You shall explain to your children on that day, 'This is done because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
2:13:9:This event will serve as a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead, so that the Lord's teachings may always be on your lips. For with a strong hand, the Lord brought you out of Egypt.
2:13:10:You shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.
2:13:11:When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised, you must dedicate every firstborn to the Lord.
2:13:12:Every firstborn male of your livestock belongs to the Lord.
2:13:13:You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Also, redeem every firstborn among your children.
2:13:14:In the future, when your child asks you, 'What does this mean?' you shall answer, 'With a strong hand, the Lord brought us out of Egypt, the land of slavery.'
2:13:15:When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed every firstborn in Egypt, both humans and animals. That is why I sacrifice to the Lord every firstborn male of the womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'
2:13:16:This event will serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a strong hand, the Lord brought you out of Egypt."
2:14:1:Then the Lord told Moses,
2:14:2:"Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They should camp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon.
2:14:3:Pharaoh will think that the Israelites are wandering aimlessly in the land, trapped by the wilderness.
2:14:4:And I will harden Pharaoh's heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord." So the Israelites did as they were instructed.
2:14:5:When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and lost their services!"
2:14:6:So he prepared his chariot and took his army with him.
2:14:7:He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, each with officers in command.
2:14:8:The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.
2:14:9:The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops, and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
2:14:10:As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians coming after them. In great fear, they cried out to the Lord.
2:14:11:They said to Moses, "Were there no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
2:14:12:Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"
2:14:13:Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again.
2:14:14:The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still."
2:14:15:Then the Lord said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
2:14:16:Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
2:14:17:I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
2:14:18:The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
2:14:19:Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,
2:14:20:coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
2:14:21:Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,
2:14:22:and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
2:14:23:The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
2:14:24:During the last watch of the night, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
2:14:25:He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt."
2:14:26:Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."
2:14:27:Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the Lord swept them into the sea.
2:14:28:The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
2:14:29:But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
2:14:30:That day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
2:14:31:And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
2:15:1:Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord, saying, "I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea.
2:15:2:The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him.
2:15:3:The Lord is a warrior; the Lord is His name.
2:15:4:Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; his chosen officers have drowned in the Red Sea.
2:15:5:The deep waters covered them; they sank to the bottom like a stone.
2:15:6:Your right hand, O Lord, is majestic in power; Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.
2:15:7:In the greatness of Your excellence, You overthrow those who rise against You; You send forth Your wrath; it consumes them like stubble.
2:15:8:With the blast of Your nostrils, the waters piled up; the flowing waters stood like a heap; the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
2:15:9:The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my desire shall have its fill of them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
2:15:10:But You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
2:15:11:Who is like You among the gods, O Lord? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
2:15:12:You stretched out Your right hand; the earth swallowed them.
2:15:13:In Your steadfast love, You have led the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them by Your strength to Your holy abode.
2:15:14:The nations heard and trembled; anguish took hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
2:15:15:Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; trembling seized the leaders of Moab; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
2:15:16:Terror and dread fell upon them; because of the greatness of Your arm, they are still as a stone, till Your people, O Lord, pass by, till the people pass by whom You have purchased.
2:15:17:You will bring them in and plant them on Your own mountain, the place, O Lord, which You have made for Your abode, the sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
2:15:18:The Lord will reign forever and ever."
2:15:19:When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the Lord brought the waters of the sea back upon them; but the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
2:15:20:Miriam, the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
2:15:21:Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea."
2:15:22:Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They traveled three days in the wilderness and found no water.
2:15:23:When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore, it was named Marah.
2:15:24:The people complained against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
2:15:25:He cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became sweet. There the Lord made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them,
2:15:26:saying, "If you diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord who heals you."
2:15:27:Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water.
2:16:1:In the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt, the whole congregation of Israel traveled from Elim to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai.
2:16:2:The entire community of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron while in the desert.
2:16:3:They said to them, "If only we had died by the Lord's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve us all to death."
2:16:4:Then the Lord said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions."
2:16:5:"On the sixth day, they are to prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days."
2:16:6:Moses and Aaron told all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the Lord who brought you out of Egypt."
2:16:7:"And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"
2:16:8:Moses continued, "The Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your complaints against him. What have we done? Your complaints are not against us but against the Lord."
2:16:9:Then Moses instructed Aaron, "Tell the whole Israelite community, 'Come before the Lord, for he has heard your grumbling.'"
2:16:10:As Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud.
2:16:11:The Lord spoke to Moses,
2:16:12:"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.'"
2:16:13:That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
2:16:14:When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
2:16:15:When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, "What is it?" because they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat."
2:16:16:He continued, "This is what the Lord has commanded: 'Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.'"
2:16:17:The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.
2:16:18:When they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
2:16:19:Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."
2:16:20:However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
2:16:21:Every morning they gathered it, as much as each one needed. But when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
2:16:22:On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
2:16:23:He said to them, "This is what the Lord commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"
2:16:24:So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.
2:16:25:"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any of it on the ground today."
2:16:26:"Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."
2:16:27:Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.
2:16:28:Then the Lord said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?"
2:16:29:"Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out."
2:16:30:So the people rested on the seventh day.
2:16:31:The house of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
2:16:32:Moses said, "This is what the Lord has commanded: 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.'"
2:16:33:So Moses told Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept for the generations to come."
2:16:34:As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.
2:16:35:The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
2:16:36:(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
2:17:1:In their journey through the desert, the Israelites traveled from the wilderness of Sin following the Lord's command, and they set up camp at Rephidim. However, there was no water for the people to drink.
2:17:2:So the people complained to Moses, saying, "Give us water to drink!" Moses responded, "Why are you arguing with me? Why are you testing the Lord?"
2:17:3:Because they were thirsty, the people grumbled against Moses and said, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it to make us, our children, and our livestock die of thirst?"
2:17:4:Moses cried out to the Lord, "What should I do with these people? They're about to stone me!"
2:17:5:The Lord instructed Moses, "Go ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Bring the staff you used to strike the Nile River, and go.
2:17:6:I will stand before you on a rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will flow from it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the presence of the elders of Israel.
2:17:7:He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites argued and tested the Lord, asking, "Is the Lord among us or not?"
2:17:8:Then Amalek attacked Israel at Rephidim.
2:17:9:Moses told Joshua, "Choose some men and fight against Amalek. Tomorrow, I will stand on the hilltop with the staff of God in my hand."
2:17:10:Joshua did as Moses instructed and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
2:17:11:As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he lowered his hands, Amalek gained the upper hand.
2:17:12:Moses' hands grew tired, so they took a stone and placed it under him for him to sit on. Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on each side, and his hands remained steady until sunset.
2:17:13:Joshua defeated Amalek and its people with the sword.
2:17:14:The Lord instructed Moses, "Write this down as a reminder in a book and recite it to Joshua: I will completely erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
2:17:15:Moses built an altar and named it "The Lord is My Banner."
2:17:16:He declared, "For hands were lifted up to the throne of the Lord. The Lord will be at war with Amalek from generation to generation."
2:18:1:Jethro, the priest of Midian and Moses' father-in-law, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and his people, the Israelites, when he brought them out of Egypt.
2:18:2:Afterward, Jethro took Zipporah, Moses' wife, who had been sent back to him,
2:18:3:along with her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses had said, "I have become a foreigner in a strange land."
2:18:4:The other son was named Eliezer, because Moses had declared, "The God of my father was my help and saved me from Pharaoh's sword."
2:18:5:Moses' father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses' wife and sons, came to him in the wilderness where he was camped near the mountain of God.
2:18:6:Jethro had sent word to Moses, saying, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."
2:18:7:So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. They asked each other about their well-being and then went into the tent.
2:18:8:Moses told his father-in-law about all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, as well as the hardships they had faced on their journey and how the Lord had delivered them.
2:18:9:Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness that the Lord had shown to Israel by rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
2:18:10:He said, "Blessed be the Lord, who has saved you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
2:18:11:Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, for he has triumphed over them in the very matter in which they had dealt proudly."
2:18:12:Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to join him in the meal before God.
2:18:13:The next day, Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
2:18:14:When Moses' father-in-law saw everything he was doing for the people, he asked, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?"
2:18:15:Moses replied to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me seeking God's guidance.
2:18:16:Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and instructions."
2:18:17:Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
2:18:18:You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
2:18:19:Listen now to my advice, and God be with you. You should represent the people before God and bring their disputes to him.
2:18:20:Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and the duties they are to perform.
2:18:21:But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
2:18:22:Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter because they will share it with you.
2:18:23:If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."
2:18:24:Moses listened to his father-in-law's advice and did everything he said.
2:18:25:He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders over the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
2:18:26:They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
2:18:27:Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
2:19:1:In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt, they arrived in the Sinai Desert.
2:19:2:They had traveled from Rephidim and set up camp in the desert. There, Israel camped in front of Mount Sinai.
2:19:3:Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, "Tell the Israelites this:
2:19:4:'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
2:19:5:Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,
2:19:6:you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
2:19:7:So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people, telling them everything the Lord had commanded him.
2:19:8:The people responded together, "We will do everything the Lord has said." Then Moses reported their words to the Lord.
2:19:9:The Lord told Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud so that the people will hear me speaking with you and always put their trust in you." After hearing this, Moses relayed the message to the people.
2:19:10:The Lord also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
2:19:11:and be ready by the third day, because on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
2:19:12:Set boundaries for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful not to approach the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain will surely die.
2:19:13:No hand is to touch that person; they must be stoned or shot with arrows. Whether human or animal, they will not be allowed to live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they may go up on the mountain."
2:19:14:Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
2:19:15:He said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Do not come near your wives."
2:19:16:On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
2:19:17:Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
2:19:18:Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.
2:19:19:As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of God answered him.
2:19:20:The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the summit. So Moses went up
2:19:21:and the Lord said to him, "Go down and warn the people not to force their way through to see the Lord, or many of them will perish.
2:19:22:Even the priests who approach the Lord must consecrate themselves, or the Lord will break out against them."
2:19:23:Moses replied, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, 'Set boundaries around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
2:19:24:The Lord said, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the Lord, or he will break out against them."
2:19:25:So Moses went down to the people and told them.
2:20:1:Then God spoke all these words, saying,
2:20:2:"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
2:20:3:"You shall have no other gods before me.
2:20:4:"Do not make any idols or images of anything in heaven above, on earth below, or in the waters beneath the earth.
2:20:5:"Don't bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of their parents, up to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me,
2:20:6:but showing mercy to thousands of generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
2:20:7:"Never misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
2:20:8:"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
2:20:9:Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
2:20:10:but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On this day, you must not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, your male or female servant, your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.
2:20:11:For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
2:20:12:"Honor your father and mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
2:20:13:"Do not commit murder.
2:20:14:"Never commit adultery.
2:20:15:"You must not steal.
2:20:16:"Refrain from giving false testimony against your neighbor.
2:20:17:"Do not covet your neighbor's house; don't desire your neighbor's wife, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
2:20:18:When the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain covered in smoke, they trembled with fear and stood at a distance.
2:20:19:They said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die."
2:20:20:Moses replied, "Don't be afraid. God has come to test you so that the fear of him may be with you, preventing you from sinning."
2:20:21:The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
2:20:22:Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven.
2:20:23:You shall not make gods of silver or gold to worship alongside me; do not make such gods for yourselves.
2:20:24:Make an altar of earth for me, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
2:20:25:If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
2:20:26:And do not go up to my altar on steps, so that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.'
2:21:1:These are the rules you must give to Israel:
2:21:2:If you buy a Hebrew servant, he will serve for six years. In the seventh year, he will be set free without having to pay anything.
2:21:3:If he came in single, he will leave single. If he was married when he arrived, his wife will leave with him.
2:21:4:If his master gives him a wife and they have children, the wife and children will belong to the master, and the man will leave alone.
2:21:5:But if the servant declares, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I do not want to go free,'
2:21:6:his master will bring him before God. He will take him to a door or doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl, and he will serve his master for life.
2:21:7:When a man sells his daughter as a servant, she won't be set free like male servants are.
2:21:8:If her master is not pleased with her and doesn't marry her, he must let her be bought back. He has no right to sell her to foreigners since he broke his promise to her.
2:21:9:If he marries her to his son, he must treat her as his own daughter.
2:21:10:If he takes another wife, he must not deprive the first one of food, clothing, and marital rights.
2:21:11:If he does not provide these three things, she may leave without paying anything.
2:21:12:Anyone who strikes and kills someone must be put to death.
2:21:13:But if it was unintentional and not premeditated, they can flee to a place I will designate.
2:21:14:If someone kills another person out of malice, even if they hide and wait, you must take them from my altar and put them to death.
2:21:15:Anyone who attacks their father or mother must be put to death.
2:21:16:Whoever kidnaps someone and either sells them or keeps them as a slave must be put to death.
2:21:17:Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.
2:21:18:If two men are fighting and one injures the other but does not kill him, he must pay for the injured man's lost time and cover his medical expenses.
2:21:19:If a man hits his male or female servant with a rod and they die on the spot, he must be punished.
2:21:20:But if the servant survives for a day or two, the master will not be punished because the servant is his property.
2:21:21:If two men are fighting and accidentally hit a pregnant woman, causing her to give birth prematurely, the man responsible must pay compensation determined by the woman's husband and approved by the judges.
2:21:22:But if there is serious injury to the woman or her child, the punishment must match the injury: life for life,
2:21:23:eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
2:21:24:burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
2:21:25:If a man strikes his male or female servant in the eye and blinds them, he must let the servant go free as compensation.
2:21:26:Similarly, if he knocks out a servant's tooth, he must let the servant go free.
2:21:27:If an ox gores a man or woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat must not be eaten. The owner of the ox will not be held responsible.
2:21:28:But if the ox had a habit of goring people and the owner knew about it but did not keep it under control, he and his ox must both be put to death.
2:21:29:However, the dead person's relatives can accept payment from the ox's owner instead of having him executed.
2:21:30:If the ox gores a male or female servant, the owner must pay their master thirty silver coins, and the ox must be stoned.
2:21:31:If someone leaves an open pit uncovered and an ox or donkey falls in,
2:21:32:the owner of the pit must compensate the animal's owner for the loss, and the dead animal will become his property.
2:21:33:If one man's ox injures another's so that it dies, they must sell the live ox and divide the money. They must also divide the dead ox.
2:21:34:But if it was known that the ox had a habit of goring, and its owner did not keep it under control, he must compensate with an ox for an ox, but the dead animal will become his property.
2:22:1:If someone steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters or sells it, they must repay five oxen for the stolen ox and four sheep for the stolen sheep.
2:22:2:When a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguilt on account of the defender.
2:22:3:However, if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution; if unable to do so, they shall be sold to pay for the theft.
2:22:4:If the stolen animal is found alive in the thief's possession—whether ox, donkey, or sheep—the thief must pay back double.
2:22:5:When someone allows their livestock to graze in a field or vineyard and lets them stray into another person's field, they must compensate with the best of their own field or vineyard.
2:22:6:If a fire breaks out and spreads to thornbushes, consuming stacked grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make full restitution.
2:22:7:When someone entrusts money or goods to a neighbor for safekeeping, and they are stolen from the neighbor's house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double.
2:22:8:If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether they have taken their neighbor's property.
2:22:9:In all cases of illegal possession involving an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any lost item about which somebody says, 'This is mine,' both parties are to bring their case before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to the other.
2:22:10:When someone gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal to their neighbor for safekeeping and it dies, is injured, or is taken away while no one is looking,
2:22:11:an oath before the Lord shall decide between the two parties whether the neighbor has laid hands on the owner's property. The owner must accept the oath, and the neighbor does not have to make restitution.
2:22:12:But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, they must compensate the owner for the loss.
2:22:13:If the animal was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the neighbor shall bring in the remains as evidence and will not be required to pay for the torn animal.
2:22:14:When someone borrows an animal from their neighbor and it gets injured or dies while the owner is not present, they must make full restitution.
2:22:15:If the owner is with the animal, the borrower does not have to pay. If the animal was hired, the fee covers the loss.
2:23:1:Don't spread false rumors. Don't join hands with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
2:23:2:Don't follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you testify in a lawsuit, don't side with the majority to pervert justice.
2:23:3:And don't favor a poor person in their lawsuit.
2:23:4:If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it.
2:23:5:If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying down under its load, don't leave it there; be sure to help them with it.
2:23:6:Don't deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
2:23:7:Stay away from false charges and don't put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.
2:23:8:Don't accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.
2:23:9:Don't oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners because you were foreigners in Egypt.
2:23:10:For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops,
2:23:11:but during the seventh year, let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
2:23:12:Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed.
2:23:13:Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.
2:23:14:Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me.
2:23:15:Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
2:23:16:Also, celebrate the Harvest Festival when you bring in the firstfruits of your labor from what you sow in the field. And celebrate the Ingathering Festival at the end of the year when you gather in your crops from the field.
2:23:17:Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord.
2:23:18:Don't offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.
2:23:19:Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Don't cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
2:23:20:See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
2:23:21:Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion since my Name is in him.
2:23:22:If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
2:23:23:My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
2:23:24:Don't bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.
2:23:25:Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,
2:23:26:and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.
2:23:27:I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.
2:23:28:I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites out of your way.
2:23:29:But I will not drive them out in a single year because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
2:23:30:Little by little I will drive them out before you until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
2:23:31:I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.
2:23:32:Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
2:23:33:Do not let them live in your land or they will cause you to sin against me because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.
2:24:1:God told Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and stay there. I will give you stone tablets with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction."
2:24:2:Moses gathered Joshua, his assistant, and said to the elders of Israel, "Wait here for us until we return. Aaron and Hur are with you; if anyone has a dispute, consult them."
2:24:3:The people of Israel agreed to all the words and rules God had given. Moses wrote down everything the Lord had said.
2:24:4:Early the next morning, Moses built an altar at the foot of the mountain, along with twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
2:24:5:Young men from Israel offered burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as peace offerings to the Lord.
2:24:6:Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, while the other half he splashed on the altar.
2:24:7:He read the Book of the Covenant aloud to the people, who responded, "We will do everything the Lord has said; we will obey."
2:24:8:Moses then took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you according to these words."
2:24:9:Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of Israel's elders went up the mountain,
2:24:10:and they saw the God of Israel. Under His feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.
2:24:11:God did not harm these leaders of Israel. They saw Him, and afterward, they ate and drank together.
2:24:12:The Lord instructed Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and stay here. I will give you the stone tablets with the law and commandments that I have written for their instruction."
2:24:13:Moses left with Joshua, his assistant, and they climbed up the mountain of God.
2:24:14:To the elders, he said, "Wait here for us until we return. Aaron and Hur are with you; if anyone has a dispute, consult them."
2:24:15:As Moses went up the mountain, the cloud covered it.
2:24:16:The glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud enveloped it for six days. On the seventh day, God called to Moses from within the cloud.
2:24:17:To the Israelites at the foot of the mountain, the appearance of the Lord's glory was like a consuming fire.
2:24:18:Moses entered the cloud and went up the mountain. He remained there for forty days and forty nights.
2:25:1:The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
2:25:2:"Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to accept the offering from everyone whose heart prompts them to give.
2:25:3:These are the offerings you shall accept from them: gold, silver, and bronze;
2:25:4:blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen; goat hair;
2:25:5:ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood;
2:25:6:oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
2:25:7:onyx stones and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and breastpiece.
2:25:8:Have them make a sanctuary for me, so that I may dwell among them.
2:25:9:Construct this tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according to the pattern I will show you.
2:25:10:Create an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high.
2:25:11:Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.
2:25:12:Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
2:25:13:Make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
2:25:14:Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
2:25:15:The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed.
2:25:16:Then put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law, which I will give you.
2:25:17:Make an atonement cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
2:25:18:Craft two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
2:25:19:Make one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; make the cherubim of one piece with the cover, at the two ends.
2:25:20:The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover.
2:25:21:Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you.
2:25:22:There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.
2:25:23:Construct a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.
2:25:24:Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
2:25:25:Also make a rim a handbreadth wide around it and put a gold molding on the rim.
2:25:26:Cast four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners, where the four legs are.
2:25:27:The rings are to be close to the rim to hold the poles used to carry the table.
2:25:28:Make the poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, and carry the table with them.
2:25:29:And make its plates and dishes of pure gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls for the pouring out of offerings.
2:25:30:Put the bread of the Presence on this table to be before me at all times.
2:25:31:Craft a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flowerlike cups, buds, and blossoms of one piece with them.
2:25:32:Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
2:25:33:Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
2:25:34:On the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
2:25:35:One bud shall be under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.
2:25:36:The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
2:25:37:Then make its seven lamps and set them up on it so that they light the space in front of it.
2:25:38:Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold.
2:25:39:A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories.
2:25:40:See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
2:26:1:Construct the tabernacle with ten curtains made of finely twisted linen, along with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. Skilfully weave cherubim into the design.
2:26:2:The length of each curtain should be twenty-eight cubits, and the width four cubits; all the curtains must have the same dimensions.
2:26:3:Join five curtains together, and then join the other five curtains together as well.
2:26:4:Make loops of blue yarn on the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same on the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
2:26:5:Fifty loops should be made on one curtain and fifty loops on the other curtain, with the loops opposite each other.
2:26:6:Create fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle becomes a single unit.
2:26:7:Next, make curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains in total are required.
2:26:8:Each curtain should measure thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, with all eleven curtains having the same dimensions.
2:26:9:Join together five curtains as one set and six curtains as another set, then fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.
2:26:10:Make fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in one set and fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
2:26:11:Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them into the loops to join the tent together as one piece.
2:26:12:The additional length of the tent's curtains will hang down over the back of the tabernacle.
2:26:13:Extend the half curtain that remains to cover the back of the tabernacle.
2:26:14:Make a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red and an outer covering of fine leather.
2:26:15:Construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
2:26:16:Each frame should be ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
2:26:17:Two projections, or tenons, should be attached to each frame, and these tenons must be parallel to each other. Do this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
2:26:18:Create twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,
2:26:19:and make forty silver bases to go under the twenty frames, with two bases for each frame, one for each tenon.
2:26:20:For the north side of the tabernacle, also construct twenty frames
2:26:21:and forty silver bases, with two bases under each frame.
2:26:22:On the west end of the tabernacle, build six frames
2:26:23:and two additional frames for the corners at the rear of the tabernacle.
2:26:24:These corner frames should be double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring. Both of them should be like this.
2:26:25:There will be eight frames in total, along with their silver bases—sixteen bases in all, with two bases under each frame.
2:26:26:Make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2:26:27:five for the frames on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the rear of the tabernacle.
2:26:28:The central crossbar should extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.
2:26:29:Overlay the frames with gold, and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.
2:26:30:Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown to you on the mountain.
2:26:31:Make a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, along with finely twisted linen. Skilfully weave cherubim into the design.
2:26:32:Hang this curtain with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.
2:26:33:Place the curtain under the clasps and bring the ark of the covenant law behind it. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.
2:26:34:Put the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law in the Most Holy Place.
2:26:35:Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and the lampstand opposite it on the south side.
2:27:1:You shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar should be square, and its height should be three cubits.
2:27:2:At the four corners, create horns that extend upward from the altar; these horns should be made of the same piece of wood as the altar itself.
2:27:3:Cover the entire altar with bronze, including the horns.
2:27:4:For the altar, make pots for removing ashes, shovels, basins, forks, and firepans; all of these utensils should be made of bronze.
2:27:5:Create a grate made of bronze mesh for the altar, and attach four bronze rings at the four corners of the grate.
2:27:6:Construct poles made of acacia wood and cover them with bronze.
2:27:7:Insert the poles into the rings on both sides of the altar to carry it.
2:27:8:Make the altar hollow, using planks; it should be built just as you were shown on the mountain.
2:28:1:You must bring your brother Aaron and his sons to you from among the Israelites, so they can serve me as priests—Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
2:28:2:Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron, to show honor and dignity.
2:28:3:Speak to all the skilled craftsmen, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, so he may serve me as a priest.
2:28:4:These are the garments they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a skillfully woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They shall make holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so they may serve me as priests.
2:28:5:They shall use gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
2:28:6:The ephod shall be made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, crafted by a skilled workman.
2:28:7:It shall have two shoulder pieces joined at its two edges, so it can be fastened together.
2:28:8:The artistically woven waistband on the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same workmanship and materials: gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:28:9:Take two onyx stones and engrave the names of the sons of Israel on them,
2:28:10:six of their names on one stone and the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth.
2:28:11:With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel. Mount them in gold filigree settings.
2:28:12:Attach the stones to the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron will bear their names on his two shoulders as a memorial before the Lord.
2:28:13:Make gold filigree settings,
2:28:14:and two chains of pure gold; make them of twisted cord work, and fasten the corded chains to the filigree settings.
2:28:15:Create a breastpiece for making decisions, skillfully worked like the ephod. Use gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:28:16:It shall be square and folded double, nine inches long and nine inches wide.
2:28:17:Set in it four rows of stones: the first row shall be a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl;
2:28:18:the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald;
2:28:19:the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
2:28:20:and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. Mount them in gold filigree settings.
2:28:21:The twelve stones represent the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
2:28:22:Make chains of pure gold for the breastpiece, twisted like cords.
2:28:23:Create two gold rings for the breastpiece and attach them to its two corners.
2:28:24:Attach the two gold cords to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
2:28:25:and fasten the other ends of the cords to the filigree settings, thus attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
2:28:26:Make two gold rings and put them on the two lower inside edges of the breastpiece, on its side facing the ephod.
2:28:27:Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the ephod's shoulder pieces, near the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
2:28:28:Bind the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it is attached just above the waistband of the ephod. This will keep the breastpiece from swinging out from the ephod.
2:28:29:Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of decision over his heart when he enters the Holy Place, as a continual memorial before the Lord.
2:28:30:Put the Urim and Thummim into the breastpiece of decision, so they will be over Aaron's heart when he goes before the Lord. In this way, Aaron will always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the Lord.
2:28:31:Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth,
2:28:32:with an opening for the head in its center. The opening shall have a reinforced edge like that of a leather garment, so it does not tear.
2:28:33:On the hem of the robe, make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, all around the hem, with gold bells between them.
2:28:34:Alternate a gold bell and a pomegranate around the hem of the robe.
2:28:35:Aaron must wear it when he ministers, and the sound of the bells will be heard when he enters the Holy Place before the Lord and when he comes out, so that he will not die.
2:28:36:Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a signet: "Holy to the Lord."
2:28:37:Tie it to the turban with a blue cord, positioning it on the front of the turban.
2:28:38:It will be on Aaron's forehead, so he may bear any guilt connected with the holy offerings the Israelites consecrate, whatever their gifts may be. It will always be on his forehead, so they may find favor with the Lord.
2:28:39:Weave the tunic of fine linen, make the turban of fine linen, and fashion the sash with embroidery.
2:28:40:For Aaron's sons, make tunics, sashes, and headbands to show dignity and honor.
2:28:41:Clothe your brother Aaron and his sons with these garments. Anoint them, ordain them, and consecrate them, so they may serve me as priests.
2:28:42:Make linen undergarments for them to cover their nakedness, extending from the waist to the thighs.
2:28:43:Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. This is a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.
2:29:1:Now this is what you must do to consecrate Aaron and his sons, so they can serve as priests to me: Take a young bull and two unblemished rams.
2:29:2:You'll also need unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil. Make these from fine wheat flour.
2:29:3:Put them into one basket and present them in the basket along with the bull and the two rams.
2:29:4:Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water.
2:29:5:Take the garments and dress Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastplate. Fasten the ephod on him using the skillfully woven waistband.
2:29:6:Place the turban on his head and attach the sacred emblem, the gold plate, to the front of the turban.
2:29:7:Then take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head.
2:29:8:Bring his sons forward and dress them in tunics.
2:29:9:Tie sashes around Aaron and his sons, and put headbands on them. The priesthood will be theirs by a lasting ordinance. This is how you will ordain Aaron and his sons.
2:29:10:Lead the bull to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:11:Slaughter the bull before the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
2:29:12:Take some of the bull's blood and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, then pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2:29:13:Take all the fat that covers the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.
2:29:14:But the bull's flesh, hide, and dung must be burned outside the camp as a sin offering.
2:29:15:Next, take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:16:Slaughter the ram, collect its blood, and splash it against the sides of the altar.
2:29:17:Cut the ram into pieces, wash the internal organs and legs, and place them with the head and other pieces.
2:29:18:Burn the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
2:29:19:Now take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2:29:20:Slaughter the ram, take some of its blood, and put it on the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then splash the blood against the sides of the altar.
2:29:21:Sprinkle some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. In this way, he and his garments will be consecrated, along with his sons and their garments.
2:29:22:From the ram, take the fat, the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh (this is the ram for ordination).
2:29:23:Also take one loaf of bread, one cake made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the Lord.
2:29:24:Place all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them wave them before the Lord as a wave offering.
2:29:25:Take them back from their hands and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before the Lord. This is an offering made by fire to the Lord.
2:29:26:Take the breast of the ordination ram from Aaron and wave it before the Lord as a wave offering, and it will be your share.
2:29:27:Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.
2:29:28:This is always to be the regular share from the Israelites for Aaron and his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the Lord from their fellowship offerings.
2:29:29:Aaron's sacred garments will belong to his descendants so that they can be anointed and ordained in them.
2:29:30:The son who succeeds him as priest and comes to the Tent of Meeting to serve in the Holy Place shall wear these garments for seven days.
2:29:31:Take the ordination ram and cook its meat in a holy place.
2:29:32:At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket.
2:29:33:They must eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. No one else may eat them because they are sacred.
2:29:34:If any of the meat from the ordination ram or any of the bread remains until morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten because it is sacred.
2:29:35:Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them.
2:29:36:Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it.
2:29:37:For seven days, make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will become holy.
2:29:38:Now this is what you are to offer on the altar regularly: two lambs, each a year old.
2:29:39:Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight.
2:29:40:With the first lamb, offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
2:29:41:Sacrifice the second lamb at twilight, along with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning. This will be a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
2:29:42:For the generations to come, this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before the Lord. There I will meet you and speak to you.
2:29:43:There also I will meet with the Israelites, and the place will be consecrated by my glory.
2:29:44:I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests.
2:29:45:I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
2:29:46:They will know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the Lord their God.
2:30:1:Construct an altar for burning incense; make it of acacia wood.
2:30:2:It should be square, measuring one cubit long and one cubit wide, with a height of two cubits. Its horns must be of one piece with it.
2:30:3:Overlay the top, sides, and horns with pure gold, and create a gold molding around it.
2:30:4:Make two gold rings beneath the molding on opposite sides to hold the carrying poles.
2:30:5:Fashion the carrying poles from acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
2:30:6:Place the altar in front of the veil that hangs near the Ark of the Covenant, where I will meet with you.
2:30:7:On this altar, Aaron must burn fragrant incense each morning when he tends the lamps.
2:30:8:Also, when Aaron lights the lamps at twilight, he must burn incense again, maintaining a regular offering before the Lord throughout your generations.
2:30:9:Do not offer any unauthorized incense on this altar, nor burnt offerings or grain offerings; it is designated solely for incense.
2:30:10:Once a year, Aaron shall make atonement on the horns of the altar with the blood of the sin offering. This annual ritual of atonement must continue throughout your generations; it is most holy to the Lord.
2:30:11:Then the Lord spoke to Moses:
2:30:12:When you take a census of the Israelites to determine their numbers, each person must pay a ransom for his life to the Lord, so that no plague will come upon them during the census.
2:30:13:Everyone who is counted must give half a shekel according to the sanctuary shekel (twenty gerahs equal one shekel). This half-shekel offering is a contribution to the Lord.
2:30:14:All who are twenty years old or older must give this offering to the Lord.
2:30:15:The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel when presenting the offering to the Lord to atone for your lives.
2:30:16:Use the money collected from the Israelites for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a reminder of their ransom before the Lord, ensuring the atonement of their lives.
2:30:17:Then the Lord instructed Moses:
2:30:18:Make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and fill it with water.
2:30:19:Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet there.
2:30:20:When they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister and present offerings by fire to the Lord, they must wash with water to avoid death.
2:30:21:This act of washing their hands and feet must be observed by Aaron and his descendants forever throughout their generations.
2:30:22:Moreover, the Lord said to Moses:
2:30:23:Gather the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half that amount (250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane,
2:30:24:500 shekels of cassia (measured by the sanctuary shekel), and a hin of olive oil.
2:30:25:Using these ingredients, prepare sacred anointing oil, blended as by a skilled perfumer; it will be holy anointing oil.
2:30:26:Anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant,
2:30:27:the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,
2:30:28:the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
2:30:29:Consecrate them so they will be most holy; whatever touches them will become holy.
2:30:30:Anoint Aaron and his sons, consecrating them to serve as priests to me.
2:30:31:Tell the Israelites that this anointing oil is to be regarded as holy throughout your generations.
2:30:32:It must not be poured on anyone else's body, nor should you make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred.
2:30:33:Whoever makes perfume like it or puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.
2:30:34:The Lord also said to Moses:
2:30:35:Take equal parts of gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense; these ingredients must be finely ground.
2:30:36:Blend the spices together skillfully to create a pure and holy incense.
2:30:37:Grind some of it into a fine powder and place it in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
2:30:38:Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the Lord.
2:30:39:Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.
2:31:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
2:31:2:"I have chosen Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.
2:31:3:I filled him with my Spirit, giving him wisdom, understanding, and expertise in all kinds of craftsmanship.
2:31:4:He is skilled in designing and working with gold, silver, and bronze,
2:31:5:as well as cutting and setting gemstones, carving wood, and creating all types of artistic work.
2:31:6:Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to help him. I have also given ability to all the skilled workers so they can create everything I've commanded you:
2:31:7:The Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant, the mercy seat that goes on top of it, and all the other furnishings for the tent;
2:31:8:The table and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories, the altar of incense,
2:31:9:The altar for burnt offerings along with its utensils, the basin and its stand,
2:31:10:The finely woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and his sons to wear when they serve as priests,
2:31:11:The anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They will create everything just as I have commanded you."
2:31:12:Then the Lord said to Moses,
2:31:13:"Tell the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, so you may know that I am the Lord who makes you holy.
2:31:14:Keep the Sabbath day, because it is holy for you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day will be cut off from their people.
2:31:15:You are to work for six days, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.
2:31:16:The Israelites shall observe the Sabbath, celebrating it throughout their generations as a lasting covenant.
2:31:17:It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'"
2:31:18:When God finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, inscribed by the finger of God.
2:32:1:While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the people gathered around Aaron and said to him, "Come on, make us gods who will lead us. We don't know what has happened to Moses, who brought us out of Egypt."
2:32:2:Aaron replied, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."
2:32:3:So all the people took off their gold earrings and handed them over to Aaron.
2:32:4:He collected the gold, melted it down, and shaped it into a calf. The people exclaimed, "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you out of Egypt!"
2:32:5:Seeing this, Aaron built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow we'll have a festival to honor the Lord."
2:32:6:The next day, the people got up early, offered sacrifices, and sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to engage in wild celebrations.
2:32:7:Meanwhile, the Lord said to Moses, "Go back down at once! Your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have become corrupt."
2:32:8:They've quickly turned away from what I commanded them, making for themselves a calf of molten gold. They've bowed down to it, sacrificed to it, and declared, 'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you out of Egypt.'"
2:32:9:The Lord continued, "I've seen these people, and they're stubborn.
2:32:10:Now leave me alone so my anger can burn against them, and I'll destroy them. Then I'll make you into a great nation."
2:32:11:Moses tried to calm the Lord down, saying, "Why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
2:32:12:Why should the Egyptians say, 'He led them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn away from your fierce anger; reconsider this plan to destroy your people.
2:32:13:Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self, saying, 'I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky, and I will give them all this land I promised. They'll inherit it forever.'"
2:32:14:So the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
2:32:15:Moses went back down the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the covenant in his hands. The tablets were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
2:32:16:The tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing, engraved on the tablets.
2:32:17:When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There's a sound of war in the camp."
2:32:18:Moses replied, "It's not the sound of victory or defeat; it's the sound of singing that I hear."
2:32:19:As he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became furious. He threw the tablets down, shattering them at the base of the mountain.
2:32:20:He took the calf they had made, burned it, ground it into powder, mixed it with water, and made the Israelites drink it.
2:32:21:Moses confronted Aaron, "What did these people do to you that you led them into such great sin?"
2:32:22:Aaron replied, "Don't be angry, my lord. You know how prone these people are to evil.
2:32:23:They said to me, 'Make us gods who will lead us. We don't know what has happened to Moses, who brought us out of Egypt.'
2:32:24:So I told them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off.' They gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"
2:32:25:Moses saw that the people were out of control because Aaron had let them get out of control, making them an object of ridicule among their enemies.
2:32:26:He stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, "Whoever is for the Lord, come to me!" All the Levites rallied to him.
2:32:27:He told them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Each of you must put on your sword and go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other. Kill your brothers, friends, and neighbors.'"
2:32:28:The Levites did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand people died that day.
2:32:29:Moses then said, "You have been set apart for the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."
2:32:30:The next day, Moses told the people, "You've committed a great sin. But now I'll go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
2:32:31:Moses went back to the Lord and said, "Oh, these people have committed a terrible sin! They made gods of gold for themselves.
2:32:32:But now, please forgive their sin. If not, erase my name from the book you've written."
2:32:33:The Lord replied to Moses, "I will erase from my book whoever has sinned against me.
2:32:34:Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."
2:32:35:And the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
2:33:1:Now the LORD spoke to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought out of Egypt, and go to the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'
2:33:2:And I will send an angel ahead of you, driving out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2:33:3:Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I won't go with you in person, because you are a stubborn people, and I might destroy you on the way."
2:33:4:When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn, and no one put on any ornaments.
2:33:5:For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stubborn people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, and I will decide what to do with you.'"
2:33:6:So the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
2:33:7:Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Meeting. Anyone who wanted to consult the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp.
2:33:8:Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.
2:33:9:As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses.
2:33:10:When the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would all bow down at the entrance of their tents.
2:33:11:The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua, son of Nun, would not leave the tent.
2:33:12:Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. You've said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.'
2:33:13:If I have indeed found favor in your eyes, please show me your ways, so that I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."
2:33:14:The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
2:33:15:Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, don't send us up from here.
2:33:16:How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?"
2:33:17:And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."
2:33:18:Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory."
2:33:19:And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
2:33:20:But," he added, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."
2:33:21:Then the LORD said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
2:33:22:When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
2:33:23:Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."
2:34:1:God said to Moses, "Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets which you broke.
2:34:2:Set a time for tomorrow morning, and then come up Mount Sinai alone. No one should be seen anywhere on the mountain, not even animals grazing nearby.
2:34:3:Don't let anyone come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; don't even let flocks or herds graze near the base of the mountain."
2:34:4:Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and early the next day he climbed Mount Sinai as God had commanded him, taking the two stone tablets with him.
2:34:5:Then the Lord descended in a cloud and stood there with him, proclaiming his name, the Lord.
2:34:6:The Lord passed in front of Moses, saying, "I am the Lord, the Lord, a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
2:34:7:maintaining love to thousands, forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin. However, I will not leave the guilty unpunished; I'll bring consequences upon the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents."
2:34:8:Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
2:34:9:He said, "Lord, if I have found favor in your eyes, please go with us. Although these people are stubborn, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."
2:34:10:God responded, "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people, I will perform wonders never before seen in any nation in the world. The people you live among will see the work of the Lord, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
2:34:11:Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2:34:12:Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.
2:34:13:Instead, you must break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and cut down their Asherah poles.
2:34:14:Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
2:34:15:Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land, because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices.
2:34:16:And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons, those daughters will lead your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods.
2:34:17:Do not make cast idols for yourselves.
2:34:18:Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
2:34:19:The firstborn of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
2:34:20:Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
2:34:21:Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
2:34:22:Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
2:34:23:Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord, the God of Israel.
2:34:24:I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the Lord your God.
2:34:25:Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
2:34:26:Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
2:34:27:Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
2:34:28:Moses stayed on the mountain with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.
2:34:29:When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was unaware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.
2:34:30:Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, and his face was shining brightly, so they were afraid to come near him.
2:34:31:But Moses called out to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.
2:34:32:Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.
2:34:33:When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
2:34:34:Whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
2:34:35:the Israelites would see that the face of Moses was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord again.
2:35:1:Moses gathered the whole Israelite community together and said to them, "These are the things that the Lord has commanded you to do:
2:35:2:You will have six days for work, but on the seventh day, it shall be a holy day of complete rest to honor the Lord. Whoever does any work on this day must be put to death.
2:35:3:Do not light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day."
2:35:4:Moses continued, saying, "This is what the Lord has ordered: Collect materials from among you to build the sanctuary. Let everyone who wants to contribute bring an offering to the Lord: gold, silver, bronze,
2:35:5:blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine linen, goat hair,
2:35:6:ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,
2:35:7:oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and fragrant incense,
2:35:8:onyx stones, and other gemstones for mounting on the ephod and breastpiece.
2:35:9:All skilled workers among you should come forward and make everything the Lord has commanded:
2:35:10:The tabernacle with its tent, coverings, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
2:35:11:The ark with its poles, the atonement cover, and the curtain shielding the ark;
2:35:12:The table with its poles, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
2:35:13:The lampstand for light with its accessories, lamps, and oil for the lamps;
2:35:14:The altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance to the tabernacle;
2:35:15:The altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
2:35:16:The curtains of the courtyard with their posts and bases, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
2:35:17:The tent pegs for the tabernacle and the courtyard, along with their ropes;
2:35:18:The woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests."
2:35:19:The entire Israelite community left Moses' presence.
2:35:20:Everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the Lord for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.
2:35:21:Both men and women came, everyone who had a willing heart, and they brought brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments—all kinds of gold jewelry. They presented these offerings to the Lord.
2:35:22:In addition, everyone who possessed blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or fine leather brought them.
2:35:23:Those who could contribute silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord, and those who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
2:35:24:All the skilled women spun yarn with their hands, and they brought what they had spun in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.
2:35:25:All the women who were skilled in weaving wove the goat hair.
2:35:26:The leaders brought onyx stones and other gemstones for mounting on the ephod and breastpiece.
2:35:27:They also brought spices and olive oil for the light, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense.
2:35:28:The Israelites, both men and women, who were willing to contribute to the work the Lord had commanded through Moses, brought their freewill offerings.
2:35:29:Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the Lord has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.
2:35:30:He has filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and skill in all kinds of craftsmanship,
2:35:31:to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
2:35:32:to cut and set stones, to work with wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.
2:35:33:Moreover, He has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
2:35:34:He has filled them with skill to perform every kind of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them master craftsmen and designers.
2:35:35:So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person to whom the Lord has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the Lord has commanded."
2:36:1:Bezalel and Oholiab, along with every skilled craftsman to whom the Lord has given wisdom and understanding to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary, are to do the work according to everything the Lord has commanded.
2:36:2:Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person in whose heart the Lord had put skill—everyone whose heart was moved to come and do the work.
2:36:3:They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought for the work on the sanctuary, and they continued to bring him freewill offerings each morning.
2:36:4:All the skilled workers who were doing the work on the sanctuary came, one after another, from the work they were doing
2:36:5:and told Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough materials to complete the work the Lord has commanded us to do."
2:36:6:So Moses gave an order, and they sent this word throughout the camp: "No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so, the people were restrained from bringing more.
2:36:7:The materials they had were sufficient to complete all the work, and there was even some left over.
2:36:8:All the skilled craftsmen among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They used finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands.
2:36:9:Each curtain was forty-two feet long and six feet wide—all the curtains were the same size.
2:36:10:They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.
2:36:11:Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done for the end curtain in the other set.
2:36:12:Fifty loops were made on one curtain, and fifty loops were made on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
2:36:13:They also made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a single unit.
2:36:14:They made eleven curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle.
2:36:15:Each curtain was forty-five feet long and six feet wide—all eleven curtains were the same size.
2:36:16:They joined five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set.
2:36:17:Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
2:36:18:They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
2:36:19:Additionally, they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of durable leather.
2:36:20:For the framework of the tabernacle, they constructed upright frames of acacia wood.
2:36:21:Each frame was fifteen feet high and twenty-seven inches wide,
2:36:22:with two projections per frame parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
2:36:23:They built twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
2:36:24:and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
2:36:25:For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames
2:36:26:and forty silver bases—two under each frame.
2:36:27:They constructed six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
2:36:28:and two frames were made for the corners at the far end.
2:36:29:At these two corners, the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.
2:36:30:So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
2:36:31:They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2:36:32:five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
2:36:33:The center crossbar was extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.
2:36:34:They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars, which were also covered with gold.
2:36:35:They made the curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker.
2:36:36:For the curtain, they made four posts of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. They also made gold hooks for them and cast four silver bases.
2:36:37:For the entrance to the tent, they made a screen of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer;
2:36:38:along with its five posts and hooks. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
2:37:1:Bezalel crafted the Ark of acacia wood, which was 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
2:37:2:He covered it with pure gold, both inside and out, and added a gold molding around it.
2:37:3:He cast four gold rings for the Ark and attached them to its four feet, with two rings on each side.
2:37:4:He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
2:37:5:Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark, so it could be carried.
2:37:6:He also made a mercy seat of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide.
2:37:7:For the mercy seat, he crafted two cherubim of gold, hammering them out at the two ends.
2:37:8:One cherub was placed at one end, and the other cherub at the other end, with their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat.
2:37:9:The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the mercy seat.
2:37:10:Next, Bezalel constructed the table of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
2:37:11:He covered the table with pure gold and added a gold molding around it.
2:37:12:He also made a border one handbreadth wide around the edge and added a gold molding to the border.
2:37:13:He cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them at the four corners near its legs.
2:37:14:The rings were placed close to the border to hold the poles for carrying the table.
2:37:15:He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold to carry the table.
2:37:16:Furthermore, he crafted the utensils for the table: dishes, pans, bowls, and pitchers made of pure gold.
2:37:17:Bezalel then created the lampstand of pure gold, hammering it out from a single piece, including its base and shaft. Its decorative flowers, buds, and petals were also part of the same piece.
2:37:18:There were six branches extending from the sides of the lampstand, three on one side and three on the other.
2:37:19:Each branch had three decorative cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.
2:37:20:On the central shaft, there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with their own buds and petals.
2:37:21:At the point where each pair of branches connected to the central shaft, there was a bud.
2:37:22:The buds and branches were all made from the same piece of hammered gold.
2:37:23:He also made seven lamps, along with their wick trimmers and trays, out of pure gold.
2:37:24:In total, he used 75 pounds of pure gold to make the lampstand and its accessories.
2:37:25:Lastly, Bezalel constructed the altar of incense using acacia wood, making it 18 inches square and 36 inches high, with horns at each corner.
2:37:26:He overlaid the top, sides, and horns of the altar with pure gold and added a gold molding around it.
2:37:27:He also attached two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides, to hold the carrying poles.
2:37:28:He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold.
2:37:29:Finally, he made the sacred anointing oil and the fragrant incense, using the skills of a master perfumer.
2:38:1:Bezalel made the altar for burnt offerings from acacia wood. It was square, measuring 7.5 feet on each side and 4.5 feet high.
2:38:2:He fashioned horns for it on its four corners, which were of one piece with the altar, and covered it with bronze.
2:38:3:For the altar, he made all its utensils from bronze: pots for removing ashes, shovels, basins, meat forks, and fire pans.
2:38:4:He created a bronze grating for it, a network that went under the ledge halfway up the altar.
2:38:5:He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating to hold the poles used to carry it.
2:38:6:He made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with bronze.
2:38:7:These poles were inserted into the rings on the sides of the altar, allowing it to be carried. He constructed the altar with hollow boards.
2:38:8:Next, he made the basin for washing and its stand from bronze, using mirrors donated by the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
2:38:9:Then Bezalel set up the courtyard. On the south side, the hangings for the courtyard were made from finely woven linen, stretching 150 feet.
2:38:10:They had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
2:38:11:On the north side, the hangings also measured 150 feet, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver.
2:38:12:The west side of the courtyard had hangings measuring 75 feet, with ten posts and ten bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver.
2:38:13:The east side, toward the sunrise, also had hangings measuring 75 feet.
2:38:14:On one side of the entrance, there were 22.5 feet of hangings, with three posts and three bronze bases.
2:38:15:On the other side of the entrance, there were another 22.5 feet of hangings, with three posts and three bronze bases.
2:38:16:All the hangings around the courtyard were made from finely woven linen.
2:38:17:The bases for the posts were made of bronze, while the hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver. The tops of the posts were overlaid with silver, and all the posts in the courtyard had silver bands.
2:38:18:The screen for the entrance of the courtyard was made from finely woven linen, embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. It measured 30 feet long and 7.5 feet high, like the hangings of the courtyard.
2:38:19:It had four posts and four bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands. The tops of the posts were overlaid with silver.
2:38:20:All the tent pegs for the Tabernacle and the courtyard were made of bronze.
2:38:21:This is the inventory of materials used in constructing the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Covenant, which was prepared at Moses' command. The Levites, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest, were responsible for keeping records.
2:38:22:Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah, crafted everything that the Lord had commanded Moses.
2:38:23:He was assisted by Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, who was skilled in engraving, designing, and embroidering with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn on fine linen.
2:38:24:The total amount of gold used for the work of the sanctuary, according to the gold offerings, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel as the standard.
2:38:25:The silver from those counted in the community came to 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel.
2:38:26:Each person provided half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, for everyone twenty years old or older who was included in the registration, totaling 603,550 men.
2:38:27:One hundred talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and the curtain, with one talent allocated for each base.
2:38:28:From the remaining 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and made bands for them.
2:38:29:The bronze offered to the sanctuary was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
2:38:30:With this bronze, Bezalel made the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar with its grating and all its utensils,
2:38:31:the bases for the surrounding courtyard, those for the entrance to the courtyard, all the tent pegs for the Tabernacle, and all the tent pegs for the surrounding courtyard.
2:39:1:They made the woven garments of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn for ministering in the sanctuary, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:2:For Aaron, they crafted the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:39:3:They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into threads to be woven into the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen.
2:39:4:They made shoulder straps for the ephod, which were attached to its two edges so it could be joined together.
2:39:5:The skillfully woven waistband on the ephod was made of the same materials: gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:6:They prepared the onyx stones, enclosed in gold filigree settings, and engraved with the names of the sons of Israel, like the engravings on a signet ring.
2:39:7:These stones were placed on the shoulder straps of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:8:The breastpiece was also made with artistic craftsmanship, using the same materials as the ephod: gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:39:9:It was square and folded double, measuring nine inches long and nine inches wide.
2:39:10:On the breastpiece, they set four rows of gemstones. The first row contained a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl;
2:39:11:the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald;
2:39:12:the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
2:39:13:and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold filigree settings.
2:39:14:The twelve stones represented the twelve sons of Israel, with their names engraved like a signet ring, each representing one of the twelve tribes.
2:39:15:On the breastpiece, they made braided chains of pure gold, like cords.
2:39:16:They also crafted two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, which they attached to the top corners of the breastpiece.
2:39:17:Then they fastened the two gold cords to the two gold rings at the top corners of the breastpiece.
2:39:18:The other ends of the cords were attached to the two gold settings, which were fastened to the shoulder straps of the ephod at the front.
2:39:19:They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower inside edges of the breastpiece, near the seam above the ephod's waistband.
2:39:20:Two additional gold rings were made and fastened to the bottom of the ephod's shoulder straps, close to where the ephod was joined, above its skillfully woven waistband.
2:39:21:They tied the breastpiece to the ephod by its rings to the ephod's rings with a blue cord, so it would rest above the ephod's waistband and not come loose, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:22:For the robe worn under the ephod, they used woven blue fabric.
2:39:23:An opening for the head was made in the center of the robe, with a woven collar around it to prevent tearing.
2:39:24:On the hem of the robe, they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.
2:39:25:They also crafted pure gold bells and attached them between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe.
2:39:26:Thus, there were alternating gold bells and pomegranates encircling the hem of the robe, which was to be worn for ministering, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:27:For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen, skillfully woven.
2:39:28:A turban of fine linen, linen headbands, and undergarments of finely twisted linen were also made.
2:39:29:The sash was made of fine linen, and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:39:30:Finally, they made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like the en graving on a signet ring, "Holy to the Lord."
2:39:31:They fastened it to the turban with a blue cord, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
2:40:1:In the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was set up.
2:40:2:Moses put the Tabernacle together, placing its bases, setting up its frames, attaching its crossbars, and setting up its posts.
2:40:3:He spread the tent over the Tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent on top, as the Lord had commanded him.
2:40:4:Next, Moses brought in the Ark of the Covenant, putting the poles through the rings, and placed the mercy seat on top.
2:40:5:He hung the curtain and shielded the Ark of the Covenant within the Most Holy Place, just as the Lord had instructed.
2:40:6:Moses positioned the table outside the curtain and arranged the bread on it, following the Lord's command.
2:40:7:He also placed the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the Tabernacle and lit the lamps before the Lord, as he was told.
2:40:8:Moses then set up the golden altar for incense in front of the curtain and burned fragrant incense on it, according to the Lord's instructions.
2:40:9:He also positioned the entrance screen at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
2:40:10:The altar for burnt offerings was placed near the entrance of the Tabernacle, and Moses offered burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, as the Lord had directed.
2:40:11:He situated the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, filling it with water for washing.
2:40:12:Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet there,
2:40:13:using the water whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
2:40:14:Moses set up the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar, and hung the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard. So, Moses finished the work.
2:40:15:Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle.
2:40:16:Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle.
2:40:17:Whenever the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on their journey;
2:40:18:but if the cloud did not lift, they would not move until the day it did.
2:40:19:The cloud of the Lord was over the Tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, visible to all the Israelites during their travels.
