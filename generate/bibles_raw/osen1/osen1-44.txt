44:1:1:In my first book, I wrote about everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning,
44:1:2:up until the day he was taken up to heaven. Before he left, he gave instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
44:1:3:After his suffering, Jesus presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs. He appeared to them over a period of forty days, discussing matters concerning the kingdom of God.
44:1:4:While they were together, he told them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the gift the Father promised, which he had mentioned earlier.
44:1:5:He said, "John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
44:1:6:So when they came together, they asked him, "Lord, are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?"
44:1:7:Jesus replied, "It's not for you to know the times or dates that the Father has set by his own authority.
44:1:8:But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44:1:9:After he said this, they watched as he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
44:1:10:As they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
44:1:11:They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."
44:1:12:Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is about a Sabbath day's journey away.
44:1:13:When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Present were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
44:1:14:They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
44:1:15:During this time, Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)
44:1:16:and said, "Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus.
44:1:17:He was one of our number and shared in our ministry."
44:1:18:(With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
44:1:19:Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44:1:20:"For," said Peter, "it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, 'May another take his place of leadership.'
44:1:21:Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
44:1:22:beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. One of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
44:1:23:So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
44:1:24:Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
44:1:25:to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."
44:1:26:They cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
44:2:1:On the day of Pentecost, they were all together in one place.
44:2:2:Suddenly, a sound like a mighty rushing wind came from heaven, filling the entire house where they were sitting.
44:2:3:Tongues that seemed like fire appeared to them, separating and resting on each person there.
44:2:4:All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.
44:2:5:Devout Jews from every nation under heaven were staying in Jerusalem at that time.
44:2:6:When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered, bewildered because each one heard their own language being spoken.
44:2:7:Amazed and astonished, they asked, "Aren't all these people speaking Galileans?
44:2:8:How is it that we hear our native languages from them?
44:2:9:We are Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
44:2:10:Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts,
44:2:11:Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own languages!"
44:2:12:They were all amazed and perplexed, asking one another, "What does this mean?"
44:2:13:But others sneered and said, "They're just drunk."
44:2:14:Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
44:2:15:These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!
44:2:16:No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
44:2:17:'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.
44:2:18:Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
44:2:19:I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
44:2:20:The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
44:2:21:And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
44:2:22:Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
44:2:23:This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
44:2:24:But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
44:2:25:David said about him: 'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
44:2:26:Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope,
44:2:27:because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay.
44:2:28:You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'
44:2:29:Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
44:2:30:But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
44:2:31:Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
44:2:32:God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
44:2:33:Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
44:2:34:For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
44:2:35:until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
44:2:36:Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah."
44:2:37:When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
44:2:38:Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44:2:39:The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call."
44:2:40:With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."
44:2:41:Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
44:2:42:They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
44:2:43:A sense of awe came over everyone, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.
44:2:44:All the believers were together and had everything in common.
44:2:45:They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
44:2:46:Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
44:2:47:praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
44:3:1:One day, Peter and John went to the temple at the time of prayer, which was three in the afternoon.
44:3:2:There, they encountered a man who had been lame from birth. He was carried daily to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he begged for money from those entering the temple.
44:3:3:When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for some money.
44:3:4:Peter looked straight at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us!"
44:3:5:The man fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
44:3:6:But Peter said, "I don't have silver or gold, but what I do have, I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk!"
44:3:7:Then, taking the man by the right hand, Peter helped him up. Instantly, the man's feet and ankles became strong.
44:3:8:He jumped to his feet, began walking, and entered the temple with them—walking, leaping, and praising God.
44:3:9:All the people saw him walking and praising God,
44:3:10:and they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44:3:11:As the man clung to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.
44:3:12:When Peter saw this, he addressed the people: "Fellow Israelites, why are you surprised by this? Why do you stare at us as if we made this man walk by our own power or godliness?
44:3:13:The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, even though he had decided to release him.
44:3:14:You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be released to you.
44:3:15:You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
44:3:16:Through faith in the name of Jesus, this man was healed—and you all know him. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.
44:3:17:Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
44:3:18:But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer.
44:3:19:So repent and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out and times of refreshing may come from the Lord,
44:3:20:and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.
44:3:21:Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
44:3:22:Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
44:3:23:Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.'
44:3:24:Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days.
44:3:25:And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your ancestors. He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring, all peoples on earth will be blessed.'
44:3:26:When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."
44:4:1:Peter and John were speaking to the people when the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees approached them.
44:4:2:These leaders were annoyed because Peter and John were teaching the people and proclaiming that Jesus had risen from the dead.
44:4:3:They arrested Peter and John and put them in jail since it was already evening.
44:4:4:The next day, many of those who had heard their message believed, and the number of believers grew to about five thousand men.
44:4:5:On the following day, the rulers, elders, and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem.
44:4:6:Annas the high priest was there, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others from the high priest's family.
44:4:7:They made Peter and John stand before them and asked, "By what power or in whose name have you done this?"
44:4:8:Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of our people,
44:4:9:if we are being questioned today because we helped a crippled man and how he was healed,
44:4:10:you should know that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
44:4:11:Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'
44:4:12:There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."
44:4:13:When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
44:4:14:Since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
44:4:15:So they ordered Peter and John to leave the council room while they discussed the matter among themselves.
44:4:16:They said, "What should we do with these men? Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it.
44:4:17:But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, let's warn them not to speak to anyone in Jesus' name again."
44:4:18:Then they called Peter and John back in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44:4:19:But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God.
44:4:20:As for us, we cannot help but speak about what we have seen and heard."
44:4:21:After further threats, they let them go. They could not find a reason to punish them because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
44:4:22:The man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
44:4:23:When Peter and John were released, they went back to their own people and reported everything the chief priests and elders had said to them.
44:4:24:Upon hearing this, their friends raised their voices together in prayer to God, saying, "Sovereign Lord, you made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.
44:4:25:You spoke through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of your servant David, who said, 'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
44:4:26:The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.'
44:4:27:Indeed, Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
44:4:28:They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
44:4:29:Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
44:4:30:Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44:4:31:After they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
44:4:32:All the believers were united in heart and mind. They shared everything they had,
44:4:33:and the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, while abundant grace was upon them all.
44:4:34:There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell their property, bring the proceeds,
44:4:35:and lay them at the apostles' feet. The money was then distributed to anyone as they had need.
44:4:36:Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement"),
44:4:37:sold a field he owned and brought the money, laying it at the apostles' feet.
44:5:1:Around that time, Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property.
44:5:2:Ananias secretly kept some of the money for himself, with his wife's knowledge, and brought only part of it to the apostles.
44:5:3:Peter confronted him, saying, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart, leading you to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds from the land sale?
44:5:4:While you still owned the property, wasn't it yours to control? And even after selling it, you could have used the money as you wished. Why did you decide to do such a thing? You haven't lied to people but to God."
44:5:5:Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. Everyone who heard about this was gripped by fear.
44:5:6:Young men came forward, wrapped up his body, carried it out, and buried him.
44:5:7:About three hours later, Sapphira, unaware of what had happened to her husband, entered the room.
44:5:8:Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?" She replied, "Yes, that's the price."
44:5:9:Peter responded, "How could you both conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out too."
44:5:10:Immediately, she collapsed at his feet and died. The young men entered, found her dead, and carried her out to bury her beside her husband.
44:5:11:Great fear swept through the whole church and all who heard about these events.
44:5:12:Through the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people. Believers would gather in Solomon's Colonnade.
44:5:13:Though others respected them, no one dared to join them; yet more and more people believed in the Lord and joined their ranks.
44:5:14:Many men and women came to faith, and the number of believers increased rapidly.
44:5:15:As a result, they even brought the sick into the streets on beds and mats so that when Peter passed by, his shadow might fall on some of them and heal them.
44:5:16:Crowds from the surrounding towns also came to Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
44:5:17:Then the high priest and his associates, who were members of the Sadducee party, became jealous.
44:5:18:They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
44:5:19:But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led them out, saying,
44:5:20:"Go, stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people the full message of this new life."
44:5:21:At daybreak, they entered the temple courts and began teaching. The high priest and his associates arrived, convened the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of Israel's elders—and sent for the apostles to be brought before them.
44:5:22:When the officers arrived at the jail, they found it securely locked, with the guards posted outside. But when they opened the doors, they discovered the cell empty.
44:5:23:Upon hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were perplexed, wondering what could have happened.
44:5:24:Then someone arrived with news, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people!"
44:5:25:At once, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles back, but without using force, for they feared that the people might stone them.
44:5:26:They brought the apostles before the Sanhedrin, where the high priest questioned them,
44:5:27:saying, "We strictly ordered you not to teach in this name. Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us responsible for this man's blood."
44:5:28:Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than human authority.
44:5:29:The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross.
44:5:30:God exalted him to his right hand as Leader and Savior, so that he might grant repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.
44:5:31:We are witnesses of these events, as is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
44:5:32:When the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and wanted to put the apostles to death.
44:5:33:But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the law, stood up in the council and ordered that the men be taken outside for a short time.
44:5:34:Then he addressed the Sanhedrin, saying, "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you plan to do with these men.
44:5:35:Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody important, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
44:5:36:After him, Judas the Galilean appeared during the time of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
44:5:37:So in the present case, I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
44:5:38:But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them; you may even find yourselves fighting against God."
44:5:39:The council members were persuaded by his argument. They called the apostles back in, had them flogged, and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they released them.
44:5:40:The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the Name.
44:5:41:Every day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
44:6:1:In those days, when the number of disciples was growing, the Greek-speaking believers complained against the Hebrew-speaking believers because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.
44:6:2:So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It's not right for us to neglect the word of God to wait on tables.
44:6:3:Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will entrust this responsibility to them,
44:6:4:while we focus on prayer and the ministry of the word."
44:6:5:The proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
44:6:6:These men were presented to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44:6:7:As a result, the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
44:6:8:Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
44:6:9:But some members of the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Jews from Cyrene and Alexandria, as well as those from Cilicia and Asia, started arguing with Stephen.
44:6:10:However, they couldn't stand up against the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
44:6:11:So they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We've heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44:6:12:This stirred up the people, the elders, and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
44:6:13:They produced false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.
44:6:14:We've heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us."
44:6:15:As all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44:7:1:Stephen said, "Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran.
44:7:2:God told him, 'Leave your country and your relatives, and come to the land that I will show you.'
44:7:3:So, Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God moved him to this land where you now live.
44:7:4:God didn't give him any inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But He promised to give the land as a possession to him and his descendants, even though he had no child at that time.
44:7:5:God said that his descendants would be foreigners in a strange land, and they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
44:7:6:But, God declared, 'I will judge the nation they serve, and after that, they will leave and worship Me in this place.'
44:7:7:Then, God made a covenant with Abraham, saying, 'Your descendants will be given this land.'
44:7:8:Abraham became the father of Isaac, who was circumcised on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
44:7:9:The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him,
44:7:10:and rescued him from all his troubles. God gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and his entire household.
44:7:11:A famine came upon Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering. Our ancestors could not find food.
44:7:12:When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there the first time.
44:7:13:On their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family.
44:7:14:Joseph then invited his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five people in total, to come to Egypt.
44:7:15:Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died.
44:7:16:Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor for a sum of money.
44:7:17:As the time drew near for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt increased greatly.
44:7:18:Then a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
44:7:19:He dealt deceitfully with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to abandon their infants, so they would not survive.
44:7:20:At this time, Moses was born. He was a beautiful child in God's eyes. For three months, he was cared for in his father's house.
44:7:21:When he was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter took him in and raised him as her own son.
44:7:22:Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became powerful in speech and action.
44:7:23:When he was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
44:7:24:Seeing one of them being mistreated, he defended him and avenged the oppressed man by killing the Egyptian.
44:7:25:Moses thought his fellow Israelites would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't.
44:7:26:The next day, he came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?'
44:7:27:But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us?
44:7:28:Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
44:7:29:Hearing this, Moses fled to Midian, where he lived as a foreigner and had two sons.
44:7:30:After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
44:7:31:Moses was amazed by the sight and went closer to look. God's voice said to him, 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
44:7:32:Then God said, 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44:7:33:I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning. I have come down to rescue them. Now, go, for I am sending you back to Egypt.'
44:7:34:This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent by God to be their ruler and deliverer, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44:7:35:Moses led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
44:7:36:This is the Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will raise up a prophet like me from among your own people.'
44:7:37:He was present when the assembly gathered in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors. He received living words to pass on to us.
44:7:38:But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and wanted to return to Egypt.
44:7:39:They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him!'
44:7:40:So, they made an idol in the shape of a calf and offered sacrifices to it. They celebrated what their hands had made.
44:7:41:God turned away from them and let them worship the heavenly bodies, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
44:7:42:You took along the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'
44:7:43:Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.
44:7:44:Years later, when Joshua led our ancestors in battle against the nations that God drove out before them, the tabernacle was taken to the land they inherited.
44:7:45:It remained there until the time of David, who found favor in God's eyes and asked to build a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44:7:46:But it was Solomon who built the house for Him.
44:7:47:However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:
44:7:48:'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? Where will my resting place be?
44:7:49:Did not my hand make all these things?'
44:7:50:You stubborn people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: you always resist the Holy Spirit!
44:7:51:Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—
44:7:52:you who received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it."
44:7:53:When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at Stephen.
44:7:54:But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44:7:55:He said, "Look! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
44:7:56:At this, they covered their ears, yelling at the top of their voices. They all rushed at him,
44:7:57:dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44:7:58:While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44:7:59:Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he died.
44:8:1:Now, around that time, Saul was wreaking havoc on the church. He entered house after house, dragging off men and women and putting them in prison.
44:8:2:Meanwhile, those who had been scattered because of the persecution went everywhere preaching the Good News.
44:8:3:Philip traveled to a city in Samaria and began proclaiming the Messiah to the people there.
44:8:4:The crowds listened attentively to what Philip said, as they saw the miraculous signs he performed.
44:8:5:Many who were demon-possessed were set free, and many others who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
44:8:6:Great joy filled the city because of these miracles.
44:8:7:Simon, a sorcerer who had amazed the people of Samaria with his magic, also believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely, astonished by the great signs and miracles he witnessed.
44:8:8:When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
44:8:9:Upon their arrival, Peter and John prayed for the new believers, asking that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
44:8:10:Up until that point, the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of Jesus.
44:8:11:As Peter and John laid their hands on the believers, they received the Holy Spirit.
44:8:12:Seeing this, Simon offered money to the apostles, saying, "Give me this power too, so that anyone I lay my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit."
44:8:13:Peter replied, "May your money perish with you, for thinking you can buy God's gift with money!
44:8:14:You have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right with God.
44:8:15:Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord, in the hope that He may forgive you for having such a thought.
44:8:16:For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."
44:8:17:Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said will happen to me."
44:8:18:After testifying and proclaiming the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages along the way.
44:8:19:An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Go south to the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza, the desert route."
44:8:20:So Philip set out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
44:8:21:and was now returning home. Seated in his chariot, he was reading aloud from the book of the prophet Isaiah.
44:8:22:The Spirit told Philip, "Go over to that chariot and stay near it."
44:8:23:As Philip approached the chariot, he heard the man reading from Isaiah and asked, "Do you understand what you're reading?"
44:8:24:The eunuch replied, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to climb in and sit with him.
44:8:25:The passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading was this: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He did not open His mouth.
44:8:26:In His humiliation, justice was denied Him. Who can speak of His descendants? For His life was taken from the earth."
44:8:27:The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
44:8:28:Philip began with that very passage and told him the Good News about Jesus.
44:8:29:As they traveled along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Look, here's water! What's stopping me from being baptized?"
44:8:30:He ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, where Philip baptized him.
44:8:31:When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him again but continued on his way rejoicing.
44:8:32:Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled around, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
44:9:1:One day, Saul was still breathing out threats and murder against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest
44:9:2:and asked for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
44:9:3:As he traveled along, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
44:9:4:He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
44:9:5:He replied, "Who are you, Lord?" The voice said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44:9:6:Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44:9:7:The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless, hearing the sound but not seeing anyone.
44:9:8:Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anything. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
44:9:9:For three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything.
44:9:10:In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, "Ananias!" He answered, "Here I am, Lord."
44:9:11:The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
44:9:12:In a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."
44:9:13:But Ananias replied, "Lord, I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
44:9:14:And now he's here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."
44:9:15:But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
44:9:16:I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."
44:9:17:So Ananias went and entered the house. He placed his hands on Saul and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44:9:18:Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,
44:9:19:and after taking some food, he regained his strength.
44:9:20:Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. At once, he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
44:9:21:All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't this the man who caused havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"
44:9:22:But Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
44:9:23:After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,
44:9:24:but Saul learned of their plot. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
44:9:25:But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
44:9:26:When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was really a disciple.
44:9:27:Then Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
44:9:28:So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44:9:29:He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
44:9:30:When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44:9:31:Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
44:9:32:As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord's people who lived in Lydda.
44:9:33:There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years because he was paralyzed.
44:9:34:Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat." Immediately, Aeneas got up.
44:9:35:All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44:9:36:In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.
44:9:37:About that time, she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
44:9:38:Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, "Please come at once!"
44:9:39:Peter went with them, and when he arrived, he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
44:9:40:Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.
44:9:41:He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.
44:9:42:This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
44:9:43:Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
44:10:1:In Caesarea, there lived a man named Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Regiment.
44:10:2:He was a devout man who respected God, along with his entire household. He generously gave to those in need and constantly prayed to God.
44:10:3:One afternoon around three o'clock, Cornelius had a vision in which he saw an angel of God coming to him and calling his name.
44:10:4:Cornelius stared at the angel, feeling terrified, and asked, "What is it, Lord?" The angel replied, "Your prayers and acts of charity have been noticed by God.
44:10:5:Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon, also known as Peter.
44:10:6:He is staying with another Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea."
44:10:7:When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among his own attendants.
44:10:8:After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
44:10:9:The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the rooftop to pray, around noon.
44:10:10:He became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44:10:11:He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
44:10:12:Inside the sheet were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds.
44:10:13:Then a voice said to him, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat."
44:10:14:But Peter replied, "No, Lord! I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
44:10:15:The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
44:10:16:This happened three times, and then the sheet was taken back up into heaven.
44:10:17:While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Look, three men are searching for you.
44:10:18:Go downstairs without hesitating, and go with them, for I have sent them."
44:10:19:Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"
44:10:20:They answered, "Cornelius, a centurion who is righteous and God-fearing, was told by a holy angel to invite you to his house so he can hear what you have to say."
44:10:21:So Peter invited them in and offered them lodging. The next day, Peter left with them, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.
44:10:22:When they arrived in Caesarea the following day, Cornelius was waiting for them, having gathered his relatives and close friends.
44:10:23:As Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
44:10:24:But Peter helped him up, saying, "Stand up; I am only a man myself."
44:10:25:As they talked, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
44:10:26:He said to them, "You know it's against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.
44:10:27:That's why I came without objection when I was sent for. Now, please tell me why you sent for me."
44:10:28:Cornelius replied, "Four days ago, I was praying in my house at this same hour, three in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man in shining clothes stood before me
44:10:29:and said, 'Cornelius, your prayers have been heard, and your acts of charity are remembered by God.
44:10:30:Now send to Joppa for Simon, who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, by the sea.'
44:10:31:So I sent for you immediately, and you were kind enough to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."
44:10:32:Peter began to speak: "I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism,
44:10:33:but accepts those from every nation who fear Him and do what is right.
44:10:34:You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
44:10:35:That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached.
44:10:36:God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and he went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil because God was with him.
44:10:37:We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
44:10:38:but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
44:10:39:He was not seen by everyone, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44:10:40:He commanded us to preach to the people and testify that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead.
44:10:41:All the prophets testify about him, that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
44:10:42:While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came upon all who were listening to his message.
44:10:43:The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
44:10:44:For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
44:10:45:"Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
44:10:46:So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
44:11:1:Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted God's message.
44:11:2:When Peter returned to Jerusalem, the Jewish believers criticized him,
44:11:3:saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!"
44:11:4:But Peter explained everything to them in detail:
44:11:5:"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. A container descended like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners from heaven, and it came down to me.
44:11:6:When I looked inside, I saw four-footed animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.
44:11:7:Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'
44:11:8:But I replied, 'No, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44:11:9:The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'
44:11:10:This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up again into heaven.
44:11:11:Right at that moment, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying.
44:11:12:The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
44:11:13:He informed us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon called Peter;
44:11:14:he will bring you a message through which you and your whole household will be saved.'
44:11:15:As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as He had on us at the beginning.
44:11:16:Then I remembered the Lord's words: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44:11:17:So if God gave them the same gift as He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to oppose God?"
44:11:18:When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "God has granted even the Gentiles repentance leading to life."
44:11:19:Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.
44:11:20:However, some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks as well, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
44:11:21:The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
44:11:22:News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44:11:23:When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
44:11:24:Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and many people were brought to the Lord.
44:11:25:Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44:11:26:and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.
44:11:27:During this time, some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44:11:28:One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)
44:11:29:The disciples, each according to their ability, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea.
44:11:30:They did this by sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul.
44:12:1:Around that time, King Herod started persecuting some members of the church.
44:12:2:He had James, the brother of John, executed with a sword.
44:12:3:Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he decided to arrest Peter as well. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
44:12:4:After arresting him, Herod put Peter in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him. He intended to bring Peter before the people for trial after the Passover.
44:12:5:So Peter was kept in prison, but the church fervently prayed to God for him.
44:12:6:The night before Herod was to bring Peter to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards stood watch at the entrance of the prison.
44:12:7:Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. The angel tapped Peter on the side, waking him up, and said, "Quickly, get up!" The chains fell off Peter's wrists.
44:12:8:The angel instructed him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." Peter did so. Then the angel said, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
44:12:9:Peter followed the angel out of the prison, not realizing that what was happening was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44:12:10:They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened by itself. They went out and walked along a street when suddenly the angel left him.
44:12:11:Then Peter realized what had happened and said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's grasp and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."
44:12:12:After considering his situation, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many believers had gathered and were praying.
44:12:13:Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door.
44:12:14:When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the door but ran back inside and announced, "Peter is at the door!"
44:12:15:The people inside told her, "You're out of your mind!" But she insisted that it was true. They said, "It must be his angel."
44:12:16:Meanwhile, Peter continued knocking. When they finally opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
44:12:17:Peter motioned for them to be quiet and explained how the Lord had brought him out of prison. He said, "Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this." Then he left for another place.
44:12:18:In the morning, there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter.
44:12:19:Herod conducted a thorough search for him but couldn't find him. So he ordered the guards' execution. Then he left Judea and went to Caesarea, where he stayed for a while.
44:12:20:Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they came to him in unity, having won over Blastus, the king's personal attendant. They asked for peace because their region depended on the king's country for food.
44:12:21:On an appointed day, Herod, dressed in royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.
44:12:22:The people shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not a man!"
44:12:23:Immediately, because Herod didn't give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44:12:24:But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
44:12:25:Barnabas and Saul completed their mission in Jerusalem. They returned, taking John Mark with them.
44:13:1:In the church at Antioch, there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
44:13:2:As they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44:13:3:So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
44:13:4:Sent by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
44:13:5:Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their assistant.
44:13:6:Traveling through the whole island until they reached Paphos, they encountered a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
44:13:7:who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
44:13:8:Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44:13:9:But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,
44:13:10:"You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
44:13:11:Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44:13:12:When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
44:13:13:Paul and his companions then set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
44:13:14:Continuing on from Perga, they reached Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath, they entered the synagogue and sat down.
44:13:15:After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak."
44:13:16:Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: "Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
44:13:17:The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt, and with mighty power he led them out of that country.
44:13:18:For about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness;
44:13:19:and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance.
44:13:20:All this took about 450 years. After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
44:13:21:Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
44:13:22:After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'
44:13:23:"From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.
44:13:24:Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
44:13:25:As John was completing his work, he said: 'Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'
44:13:26:Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
44:13:27:The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
44:13:28:Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have
44:13:29:him executed.
44:13:30:When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
44:13:31:But God raised him from the dead,
44:13:32:and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
44:13:33:We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors
44:13:34:he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: 'You are my son; today I have become your father.'
44:13:35:God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'
44:13:36:So it is also stated elsewhere: 'You will not let your holy one see decay.'
44:13:37:Now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.
44:13:38:But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
44:13:39:"Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
44:13:40:Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
44:13:41:Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:
44:13:42:'Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'"
44:13:43:As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
44:13:44:When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44:13:45:On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44:13:46:When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.
44:13:47:Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
44:13:48:For this is what the Lord has commanded us: 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44:13:49:When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
44:13:50:The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.
44:13:51:But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.
44:13:52:So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.
44:13:53:And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44:14:1:In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas arrived at the local synagogue, where they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed.
44:14:2:However, some of the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44:14:3:Despite this, Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of His grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders.
44:14:4:The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
44:14:5:When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their leaders, to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas, they became aware of it
44:14:6:and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe, as well as the surrounding region,
44:14:7:where they continued to preach the good news.
44:14:8:In Lystra, a man sat who had been crippled in his feet from birth and had never walked.
44:14:9:He listened to Paul's words, and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
44:14:10:said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" The man leaped up and began to walk.
44:14:11:When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their local language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"
44:14:12:Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
44:14:13:The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates, wanting to offer sacrifices along with the crowds.
44:14:14:But when Paul and Barnabas heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,
44:14:15:"People, why are you doing this? We are only human like you! We're here to bring you good news, urging you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them."
44:14:16:In the past, He allowed all nations to go their own way.
44:14:17:Yet He has not left Himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; He provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."
44:14:18:Even with these words, they barely restrained the people from offering sacrifices to them.
44:14:19:Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
44:14:20:However, after the disciples had gathered around him, Paul got up and went back into the city. The next day, he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
44:14:21:They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
44:14:22:strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God."
44:14:23:Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church, praying and fasting as they committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
44:14:24:After passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
44:14:25:When they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44:14:26:From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
44:14:27:On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
44:14:28:And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
44:15:1:During that time, some individuals arrived from Judea and started teaching the believers that they couldn't be saved unless they were circumcised according to Moses' law.
44:15:2:This created a heated debate and division between Paul, Barnabas, and these teachers. The church decided to send Paul, Barnabas, and some others to Jerusalem to discuss this issue with the apostles and elders.
44:15:3:After being sent on their way by the church, they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, sharing the news of how Gentiles were turning to God. This brought great joy to all the believers.
44:15:4:When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders. They reported everything God had done through them.
44:15:5:However, some Pharisees who believed in Jesus insisted that Gentiles must be circumcised and required to follow Moses' law.
44:15:6:The apostles and elders gathered together to consider this matter.
44:15:7:After much discussion, Peter stood up and addressed them, "Brothers, you know that in the early days, God chose me to bring the message of salvation to the Gentiles so they could hear and believe.
44:15:8:God, who knows everyone's heart, showed his approval by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
44:15:9:He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts through faith.
44:15:10:So why are you now challenging God by placing a burden on the Gentile believers that neither our ancestors nor we could bear?
44:15:11:Instead, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."
44:15:12:The whole assembly fell silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul describe the miraculous signs and wonders God had performed among the Gentiles through them.
44:15:13:When they finished speaking, James responded, "Brothers, listen to me.
44:15:14:Simon has described how God first showed his concern for the Gentiles by taking a people for himself from among them.
44:15:15:The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
44:15:16:'After this, I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,
44:15:17:that the remnant of humanity may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things.'
44:15:18:These things have been known from long ago.
44:15:19:So, my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
44:15:20:Instead, we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
44:15:21:For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."
44:15:22:Then the apostles and elders, along with the whole church, decided to select some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, both leaders among the believers.
44:15:23:They wrote the following letter: "The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.
44:15:24:We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44:15:25:So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,
44:15:26:who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44:15:27:Therefore, we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44:15:28:It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential requirements:
44:15:29:You must abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell."
44:15:30:The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
44:15:31:The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
44:15:32:Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, shared many encouraging words with the believers, strengthening them.
44:15:33:After spending some time there, they were sent back to Jerusalem with the blessing of peace by the brothers.
44:15:34:But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.
44:15:35:Some time later, Paul suggested to Barnabas that they revisit the towns where they had previously preached the word of the Lord, to see how the new believers were doing.
44:15:36:Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,
44:15:37:but Paul didn't think it was wise to take him, since he had deserted them in Pamphylia and hadn't continued with them in their work.
44:15:38:Their disagreement was so sharp that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
44:15:39:while Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.
44:15:40:He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44:16:1:Paul visited Derbe and Lystra, where he found a disciple named Timothy. His mother was Jewish and a believer, but his father was Greek.
44:16:2:The believers in Lystra and Iconium spoke highly of Timothy.
44:16:3:Paul wanted to take Timothy along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was Greek.
44:16:4:As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
44:16:5:So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew daily in numbers.
44:16:6:They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in the province of Asia.
44:16:7:When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
44:16:8:So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
44:16:9:During the night, Paul had a vision of a man from Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44:16:10:After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44:16:11:From Troas, we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis.
44:16:12:From there, we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
44:16:13:On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
44:16:14:One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.
44:16:15:When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.
44:16:16:Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit that enabled her to predict the future. She earned a lot of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
44:16:17:This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."
44:16:18:She kept doing this for many days. Finally, Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!" At that moment, the spirit left her.
44:16:19:When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
44:16:20:They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and they are throwing our city into an uproar."
44:16:21:They advocate customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.
44:16:22:The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
44:16:23:After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
44:16:24:Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44:16:25:About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
44:16:26:Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake that shook the foundations of the prison. At once, all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose.
44:16:27:The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44:16:28:But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"
44:16:29:The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
44:16:30:He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44:16:31:They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household."
44:16:32:Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
44:16:33:At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
44:16:34:The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
44:16:35:When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men."
44:16:36:The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace."
44:16:37:But Paul said to the officers: "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."
44:16:38:The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
44:16:39:They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
44:16:40:After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.
44:17:1:After traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived in Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44:17:2:As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and for three Sabbaths, he discussed the Scriptures with them.
44:17:3:He explained and demonstrated that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, saying, "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."
44:17:4:Some of the Jews were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, as did numerous God-fearing Greeks and many prominent women.
44:17:5:But the unbelieving Jews became jealous and gathered some wicked men from the marketplace to form a mob. They caused an uproar in the city and attacked the house of Jason, intending to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.
44:17:6:When they couldn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have now come here,
44:17:7:and Jason has welcomed them into his home. They all defy Caesar's decrees, claiming that there is another king, Jesus."
44:17:8:Hearing this, the crowd and the city officials were greatly disturbed.
44:17:9:But after receiving a bond from Jason and the others, they let them go.
44:17:10:The believers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. Upon arriving, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
44:17:11:The Berean Jews were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they eagerly examined the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul said was true.
44:17:12:Many of them believed, along with numerous prominent Greek women and men.
44:17:13:When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, they came there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.
44:17:14:The believers quickly sent Paul to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.
44:17:15:Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens, then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
44:17:16:While waiting for them in Athens, Paul was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
44:17:17:So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
44:17:18:A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods," because he was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44:17:19:They took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44:17:20:You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean."
44:17:21:(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
44:17:22:Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
44:17:23:For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown, I am going to proclaim to you.
44:17:24:The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.
44:17:25:And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all people life and breath and everything else.
44:17:26:From one man, he made every nation of humanity to inhabit the entire earth, determining their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands.
44:17:27:God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.
44:17:28:'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'
44:17:29:Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.
44:17:30:In the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
44:17:31:For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead."
44:17:32:When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject."
44:17:33:At that, Paul left the Areopagus.
44:17:34:A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
44:18:1:After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44:18:2:In Corinth, he met a Jew named Aquila, originally from Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited them,
44:18:3:and because they shared the same trade as tentmakers, he stayed and worked with them.
44:18:4:Every Sabbath, he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade both Jews and Greeks.
44:18:5:When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
44:18:6:However, when they opposed him and insulted him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles."
44:18:7:So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
44:18:8:Crispus, the synagogue leader, believed in the Lord along with his entire household, and many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.
44:18:9:One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.
44:18:10:For I am with you, and no one will attack or harm you, because I have many people in this city."
44:18:11:So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
44:18:12:While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united against Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
44:18:13:saying, "This man is persuading people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."
44:18:14:Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If this were a matter of wrongdoing or serious crime, I would have reason to accept your complaint.
44:18:15:But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law, settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things."
44:18:16:So he drove them off from the tribunal.
44:18:17:Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the tribunal; but Gallio showed no concern for any of this.
44:18:18:Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time, then said goodbye to the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.
44:18:19:They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
44:18:20:When they asked him to stay longer, he declined.
44:18:21:But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44:18:22:When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
44:18:23:After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a journey, traveling from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44:18:24:Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker, well-versed in the Scriptures.
44:18:25:He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and spoke with great fervor about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44:18:26:He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
44:18:27:When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
44:18:28:For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
44:19:1:During the time when Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and finally arrived in Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
44:19:2:He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They replied, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44:19:3:Paul then inquired, "So what baptism did you experience?" They answered, "John's baptism."
44:19:4:Paul explained, "John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling people to believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
44:19:5:Hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44:19:6:When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
44:19:7:There were about twelve men in total.
44:19:8:Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, discussing and persuading people about the kingdom of God.
44:19:9:But when some became stubborn and refused to believe, publicly slandering the Way, Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and held daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44:19:10:This continued for two years, so that everyone living in Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.
44:19:11:God performed extraordinary miracles through Paul,
44:19:12:so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and evil spirits left them.
44:19:13:Some Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to cast out evil spirits, saying, "I command you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches."
44:19:14:Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, were doing this.
44:19:15:The evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?"
44:19:16:Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, overpowered them all, and beat them so severely that they ran out of the house naked and wounded.
44:19:17:This became known to all Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and they were all filled with fear. The name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
44:19:18:Many believers openly confessed their sins and revealed their secret practices.
44:19:19:A large number of those who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When the value of the scrolls was calculated, it came to fifty thousand silver coins.
44:19:20:In this way, the word of the Lord continued to spread and gain influence.
44:19:21:After these events, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. He said, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44:19:22:He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia while he stayed for a while longer in Asia.
44:19:23:Around that time, there was a major disturbance about the Way.
44:19:24:A silversmith named Demetrius made silver shrines of Artemis, providing a lot of business for the craftsmen.
44:19:25:He called a meeting of the craftsmen and related tradesmen and said, "You know that our prosperity comes from this business.
44:19:26:But you also see and hear that not only in Ephesus but throughout almost all of Asia, this man Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.
44:19:27:There is a danger that our trade will lose its good reputation, and the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited. The goddess whom all Asia and the world worship will be dethroned from her divine majesty."
44:19:28:When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44:19:29:The whole city was thrown into confusion. They rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.
44:19:30:Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him.
44:19:31:Even some officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater.
44:19:32:The assembly was in chaos. Some were shouting one thing, others another. Most of the people didn't even know why they were there.
44:19:33:The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward, and some of the crowd explained that he was a Jew. Alexander motioned for silence so he could make his defense before the people.
44:19:34:But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44:19:35:Finally, the city clerk quieted the crowd and said, "People of Ephesus, who doesn't know that our city is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and her image that fell from heaven?
44:19:36:Since these things are undeniable, you should calm down and not do anything rash.
44:19:37:You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
44:19:38:If Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
44:19:39:If there's anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.
44:19:40:As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there's no reason we can give to justify this commotion."
44:19:41:After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
44:20:1:After the uproar ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, encouraged them, and then said his goodbyes before departing for Macedonia.
44:20:2:He traveled through those regions, speaking words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece.
44:20:3:Paul stayed there for three months, but when he was about to sail for Syria, he learned of a plot against him by the Jews, so he decided to return through Macedonia.
44:20:4:Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus from Asia accompanied him.
44:20:5:These men went ahead and waited for us in Troas.
44:20:6:We sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed for a week.
44:20:7:On the first day of the week, when we gathered to break bread, Paul spoke to the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he continued talking until midnight.
44:20:8:There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
44:20:9:A young man named Eutychus, sitting on a windowsill, became very drowsy as Paul talked on and on. Overcome by sleep, he fell from the third story and was pronounced dead.
44:20:10:Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, and embraced him. "Don't worry," he said, "he's alive."
44:20:11:Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. He continued conversing with them until dawn, and then he left.
44:20:12:The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
44:20:13:We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we would pick up Paul. He had arranged this because he wanted to go there on foot.
44:20:14:When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
44:20:15:The next day, we sailed from there and arrived off Chios. The following day, we crossed over to Samos, and a day later, we came to Miletus.
44:20:16:Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
44:20:17:From Miletus, he sent a message to the elders of the church in Ephesus, asking them to come to him.
44:20:18:When they arrived, he said to them, "You know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day I set foot in Asia.
44:20:19:I served the Lord with humility, tears, and trials that came upon me through the plots of the Jews.
44:20:20:I never shrank back from telling you what was helpful or from teaching you publicly and in your homes.
44:20:21:I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
44:20:22:And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
44:20:23:I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships await me.
44:20:24:But I don't consider my life worth anything to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace.
44:20:25:Now, I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again.
44:20:26:Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.
44:20:27:For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
44:20:28:Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.
44:20:29:I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
44:20:30:Even from your own number, men will arise and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them.
44:20:31:So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
44:20:32:Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44:20:33:I have not coveted anyone's silver, gold, or clothing.
44:20:34:You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
44:20:35:In everything, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus himself, who said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44:20:36:When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
44:20:37:They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him goodbye.
44:20:38:What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
44:21:1:After we had said our goodbyes, we left and set sail for the coast of Tyre, where the ship was supposed to unload its cargo.
44:21:2:We found some disciples in Tyre and stayed with them for a week. Through the Spirit, they warned Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
44:21:3:When our time there came to an end, we left and continued on our journey. The whole family, including the women and children, accompanied us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach and prayed together.
44:21:4:We said goodbye to each other, then returned to the ship and sailed to Ptolemais, while they went back home.
44:21:5:In Ptolemais, we greeted the brothers and sisters and spent a day with them.
44:21:6:The next day, we departed and arrived at Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
44:21:7:He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
44:21:8:During our stay, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44:21:9:He approached Paul, took his belt, and bound his own hands and feet, saying, "The Holy Spirit says this: 'In this way, the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.'"
44:21:10:When we heard this, both we and the local believers begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
44:21:11:But Paul replied, "Why are you crying and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44:21:12:When he could not be persuaded, we stopped urging him and said, "The Lord's will be done."
44:21:13:After spending some time there, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
44:21:14:Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us, bringing Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.
44:21:15:When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly.
44:21:16:The next day, Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were present.
44:21:17:Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44:21:18:When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.
44:21:19:They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.
44:21:20:What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44:21:21:So do this: We have four men who have taken a vow.
44:21:22:Join these men, go through the purification rites with them, and pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself live in obedience to the law.
44:21:23:As for the Gentile believers, we have already written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality."
44:21:24:Paul agreed to their request. The next day, he took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
44:21:25:When the seven days were almost over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
44:21:26:shouting, "Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. Besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place."
44:21:27:They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
44:21:28:The whole city was aroused, and people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.
44:21:29:While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44:21:30:He immediately took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44:21:31:The commander came up and arrested Paul, ordering him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
44:21:32:Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another. Since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.
44:21:33:When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.
44:21:34:They followed, shouting, "Get rid of him!"
44:21:35:As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" The commander replied, "Do you speak Greek?
44:21:36:Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?"
44:21:37:Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please, let me speak to the people."
44:21:38:With the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he spoke to them in Aramaic.
44:22:1:Paul stood before the crowd and said, "Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense before you now."
44:22:2:When they heard him speaking in their own language, they became even more quiet.
44:22:3:He continued, "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was zealous for God, just as you all are today.
44:22:4:I persecuted the followers of the Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,
44:22:5:as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
44:22:6:About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
44:22:7:I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?'
44:22:8:I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
44:22:9:My companions saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
44:22:10:I asked, 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord replied, 'Get up and go into Damascus. There you will be told everything that has been assigned for you to do.'
44:22:11:Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus.
44:22:12:A man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there,
44:22:13:came to me, stood beside me, and said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And at that very moment, I was able to see him.
44:22:14:Then he said, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
44:22:15:You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.
44:22:16:And now, why are you waiting? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'
44:22:17:Later, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance
44:22:18:and saw the Lord speaking to me. 'Hurry,' he said, 'leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
44:22:19:I replied, 'Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
44:22:20:And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.'
44:22:21:Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44:22:22:The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!"
44:22:23:As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
44:22:24:the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.
44:22:25:As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?"
44:22:26:When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen."
44:22:27:The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.
44:22:28:Then the commander said, "I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money." Paul replied, "But I was born a citizen."
44:22:29:Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
44:22:30:The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Council to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
44:23:1:One day, Paul was looking intently at the council and said, "My fellow citizens, I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God up to this day."
44:23:2:The high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
44:23:3:Paul responded, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there judging me according to the law, yet you violate the law by ordering me to be struck!"
44:23:4:Those nearby said, "How dare you insult God's high priest?"
44:23:5:Paul replied, "I didn't know, my friends, that he was the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
44:23:6:Recognizing that some were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead!"
44:23:7:As he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44:23:8:The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits; but the Pharisees believe in all these things.
44:23:9:A great uproar ensued, and some of the scribes from the Pharisees' party stood up and argued vehemently, "We find nothing wrong with this man! What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44:23:10:The conflict became so intense that the commander, fearing that Paul would be torn apart by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and rescue him from their midst, bringing him back to the barracks.
44:23:11:The following night, the Lord stood by Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."
44:23:12:In the morning, some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
44:23:13:More than forty men were involved in this plot.
44:23:14:They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath not to taste any food until we have killed Paul.
44:23:15:Now then, you and the council must inform the commander that you want to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though you intend to inquire more thoroughly about him. We will be ready to kill him before he arrives."
44:23:16:However, Paul's nephew heard of their ambush, and he went to the barracks and told Paul.
44:23:17:Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to report to him."
44:23:18:So the centurion took him to the commander and said, "The prisoner Paul called me over and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."
44:23:19:The commander took him by the hand, stepped aside, and asked privately, "What is it that you have to report to me?"
44:23:20:He replied, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, pretending they want to examine his case more closely.
44:23:21:But don't give in to them, for more than forty men are lying in wait for him. They have sworn an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent."
44:23:22:The commander dismissed the young man, instructing him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."
44:23:23:Then he called two centurions and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
44:23:24:Also, provide mounts for Paul to ride and take him safely to Governor Felix."
44:23:25:He wrote a letter with the following content:
44:23:26:"Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency Governor Felix: Greetings.
44:23:27:This man was seized by the Jews, and they were about to kill him when I intervened with my troops and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44:23:28:I wanted to know the charges they were accusing him of, so I brought him before their council.
44:23:29:I discovered that he was accused of matters related to their law, but there was no charge deserving death or imprisonment.
44:23:30:When I was informed of a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, and I also instructed his accusers to present their case against him before you."
44:23:31:So the soldiers, as they were ordered, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
44:23:32:The next day, the soldiers returned to the barracks, leaving the horsemen to go on with him.
44:23:33:When they arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and presented Paul to him.
44:23:34:After reading the letter, the governor asked Paul which province he was from. When he learned that Paul was from Cilicia,
44:23:35:he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers arrive." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.
44:24:1:Five days later, the high priest Ananias arrived with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They presented their case against Paul to the governor.
44:24:2:When Paul was called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "We enjoy much peace because of you, Governor Felix, and many improvements are made for this nation due to your wise leadership.
44:24:3:We acknowledge this with gratitude, and we don't want to bother you with too many details.
44:24:4:But I beg you to listen patiently to our brief statement of facts against this man.
44:24:5:We have found him to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect called the Nazarenes.
44:24:6:He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we arrested him.
44:24:7:(omitted in modern translations)
44:24:8:By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we bring against him."
44:24:9:The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were true.
44:24:10:When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he responded, "I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, so I gladly make my defense.
44:24:11:You can verify that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
44:24:12:During this time, they did not find me arguing with anyone or causing a disturbance among the people, either in the temple, the synagogues, or throughout the city.
44:24:13:Neither can they prove the accusations they now bring against me.
44:24:14:However, I do admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and what is written in the Prophets.
44:24:15:I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
44:24:16:Because of this, I always strive to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people.
44:24:17:After several years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation and to offer sacrifices.
44:24:18:While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, purified and without any crowd or disturbance.
44:24:19:But there were some Jews from Asia who should be here before you to bring charges if they have anything against me.
44:24:20:Or let these men here state what crime they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
44:24:21:unless it concerns this one statement I shouted while standing among them: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"
44:24:22:Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the proceedings, saying, "When Lysias the commander arrives, I will decide your case."
44:24:23:He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
44:24:24:Several days later, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
44:24:25:As Paul discussed righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."
44:24:26:At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
44:24:27:After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wanting to grant a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul in prison.
44:25:1:Now, when Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
44:25:2:The chief priests and Jewish leaders informed him about Paul, presenting their case against him.
44:25:3:They requested a favor from Festus, asking him to have Paul brought to Jerusalem—secretly planning to ambush and kill him on the way.
44:25:4:Festus, however, replied that Paul was being held at Caesarea and that he himself would be going there soon.
44:25:5:"Let your leaders come with me," he said. "If there's anything wrong with the man, they can press charges against him there."
44:25:6:After spending no more than eight or ten days among them, Festus returned to Caesarea. The next day, he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought in.
44:25:7:When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, leveling serious accusations against him which they couldn't prove.
44:25:8:In response, Paul defended himself, saying, "I've committed no offense against the Jewish law, the temple, or Caesar."
44:25:9:Wanting to do the Jews a favor, Festus asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me on these charges?"
44:25:10:But Paul replied, "I'm standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I should be tried. I haven't wronged the Jews, as you well know.
44:25:11:If I'm guilty of any crime deserving death, I don't refuse to die. But if there's nothing to their accusations, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
44:25:12:Festus, after conferring with his council, declared, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."
44:25:13:A few days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
44:25:14:During their stay, which lasted several days, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, saying, "There's a prisoner here, left behind by Felix.
44:25:15:When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and Jewish elders brought charges against him, demanding his condemnation.
44:25:16:I told them it's not Roman practice to hand over anyone without giving them a chance to face their accusers and defend themselves against the charges.
44:25:17:So when they came here, I wasted no time and convened the court the very next day. I ordered the man to be brought in.
44:25:18:But when the accusers stood up, they didn't charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.
44:25:19:Instead, they had some disagreements with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died but whom Paul claimed was alive.
44:25:20:Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate such matters, I asked if he'd be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these issues.
44:25:21:But Paul appealed for his case to be held over for the Emperor's decision, so I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar."
44:25:22:Agrippa said to Festus, "I'd like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," Festus replied, "you will hear him."
44:25:23:The next day, Agrippa and Bernice entered the audience hall with great pomp, accompanied by high-ranking military officers and prominent men of the city. At Festus' command, Paul was brought in.
44:25:24:Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him, both here and in Jerusalem, insisting he shouldn't be allowed to live any longer.
44:25:25:I found that he had done nothing deserving death, but since he appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
44:25:26:However, I have nothing specific to write to our sovereign about him. That's why I've brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after examining him, I might have something to write.
44:25:27:It seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him."
44:26:1:Agrippa told Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:
44:26:2:"King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
44:26:3:especially since you are well-acquainted with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44:26:4:My life from the beginning was spent among my own people and in Jerusalem; everyone who knows me can testify to this.
44:26:5:They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering to the strictest sect of our religion.
44:26:6:And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise God made to our ancestors—
44:26:7:a promise our twelve tribes hope to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. It is because of this hope, King Agrippa, that I am accused by the Jews.
44:26:8:Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
44:26:9:I too was once convinced that I ought to do everything possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44:26:10:That's exactly what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests, I put many of the Lord's followers in prison, and when they were condemned to death, I cast my vote against them.
44:26:11:In all the synagogues, I frequently punished them and tried to force them to blaspheme. My rage against them was so intense that I even pursued them to foreign cities.
44:26:12:While on my way to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
44:26:13:at midday, King Agrippa, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me.
44:26:14:We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44:26:15:I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord replied, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44:26:16:But get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you as a servant and witness of what you have seen and will see of me.
44:26:17:I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
44:26:18:to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
44:26:19:So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
44:26:20:Instead, I first told those in Damascus and Jerusalem, then throughout all Judea, and also the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with their repentance.
44:26:21:For these reasons, the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
44:26:22:But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen:
44:26:23:that the Messiah would suffer, and as the first to rise from the dead, he would bring light to both our people and the Gentiles."
44:26:24:As Paul was making this defense, Festus exclaimed, "You're out of your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!"
44:26:25:But Paul replied, "I am not insane, most excellent Festus. I am speaking the sober truth.
44:26:26:Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.
44:26:27:King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do."
44:26:28:Agrippa said to Paul, "In such a short time, are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian?"
44:26:29:Paul replied, "Whether it takes a short or a long time, I pray to God that not only you but also everyone here today might become what I am, except for these chains."
44:26:30:The king stood up, along with the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
44:26:31:After they had left the room, they talked with one another and said, "This man is not doing anything deserving of death or imprisonment."
44:26:32:Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44:27:1:When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.
44:27:2:We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia, and set out. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
44:27:3:The next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly, allowing him to go see his friends and receive their care.
44:27:4:From there we put out to sea again and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44:27:5:After crossing the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived in Myra, a city in Lycia.
44:27:6:There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and transferred us to it.
44:27:7:For many days we made slow progress and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. As the wind didn't allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
44:27:8:With difficulty, we sailed along the coast and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
44:27:9:Much time had been lost, and sailing had become dangerous because it was now after the Day of Atonement. So Paul warned them,
44:27:10:"Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives as well."
44:27:11:But the centurion, instead of listening to Paul, followed the advice of the pilot and the owner of the ship.
44:27:12:Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
44:27:13:When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained their purpose; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
44:27:14:But before very long, a fierce wind called the "northeaster" rushed down from the island.
44:27:15:The ship was caught by the storm and couldn't head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.
44:27:16:As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's lifeboat.
44:27:17:Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
44:27:18:We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.
44:27:19:On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
44:27:20:When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.
44:27:21:After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
44:27:22:But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
44:27:23:Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me
44:27:24:and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'
44:27:25:So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
44:27:26:Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island."
44:27:27:On the fourteenth night, we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
44:27:28:Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
44:27:29:In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
44:27:30:But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."
44:27:31:So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
44:27:32:Just before dawn, Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven't eaten anything.
44:27:33:Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head."
44:27:34:After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
44:27:35:They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
44:27:36:In all, there were 276 of us on board.
44:27:37:When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
44:27:38:When daylight came, they did not recognize the land but saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
44:27:39:Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
44:27:40:But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
44:27:41:The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
44:27:42:But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
44:27:43:The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way, everyone reached land safely.
44:28:1:Once they were safely ashore, they learned that the island was called Malta.
44:28:2:The locals showed them extraordinary kindness, welcoming them warmly and kindling a fire due to the rain and cold.
44:28:3:As Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper emerged because of the heat and fastened itself onto his hand.
44:28:4:When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; though he escaped the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
44:28:5:However, Paul shook off the snake into the fire and suffered no harm.
44:28:6:They expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
44:28:7:Near the place where they landed, there was an estate owned by Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us into his home and treated us with great hospitality for three days.
44:28:8:Publius' father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went to see him and, after praying, placed his hands on him and healed him.
44:28:9:After this happened, the rest of the sick on the island came to Paul, and they too were healed.
44:28:10:In gratitude, the islanders honored us with many gifts, and when we were ready to sail, they supplied us with everything we needed.
44:28:11:Three months later, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island. The ship had the figurehead of the twin gods, Castor and Pollux.
44:28:12:We arrived at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.
44:28:13:From there, we sailed along the coast until we reached Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day, we came to Puteoli.
44:28:14:There, we found some believers who invited us to stay with them for a week. And so, we were encouraged.
44:28:15:When the believers in Rome heard that we were coming, they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was greatly encouraged.
44:28:16:When we finally arrived in Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier guarding him.
44:28:17:Three days later, Paul called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44:28:18:The Romans examined me and wanted to release me because I had committed no crime deserving death.
44:28:19:But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, even though I had no charge to bring against my own people.
44:28:20:For this reason, I have asked to see you and speak with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."
44:28:21:They replied, "We have not received any letters about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews who have come from there reported or said anything bad about you.
44:28:22:But we would like to hear what you believe, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect."
44:28:23:So they arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and many people came to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening, he explained and testified about the kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
44:28:24:Some were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe.
44:28:25:Disagreeing among themselves, they began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet:
44:28:26:'Go to this people and say, you will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
44:28:27:For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.'
44:28:28:Therefore, I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!"
44:28:29:After he said this, the Jews left, arguing vigorously among themselves.
44:28:30:For two whole years, Paul stayed in his rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
44:28:31:He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
