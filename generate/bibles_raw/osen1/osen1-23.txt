23:1:1:This is the vision that Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23:1:2:Hear me, heavens, and listen, earth, for the Lord has spoken: "I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
23:1:3:The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel does not know; my people do not understand."
23:1:4:Oh sinful nation, people weighed down by guilt, offspring of evildoers, corrupt children! They have abandoned the Lord, despised the Holy One of Israel, and turned their backs on him.
23:1:5:Why do you keep on rebelling? Your whole head is sick, and your whole heart faint.
23:1:6:From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, there's no soundness—only wounds, bruises, and festering sores, which haven't been treated, bandaged, or soothed with oil.
23:1:7:Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners devour your land in your presence, leaving it ruined and overthrown.
23:1:8:The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
23:1:9:If the Lord of Hosts hadn't left us a few survivors, we would be like Sodom; we would resemble Gomorrah.
23:1:10:Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom! Listen to the instruction of our God, people of Gomorrah!
23:1:11:"What use are your many sacrifices to me?" says the Lord. "I've had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed animals. I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.
23:1:12:When you come to appear before me, who has required this from your hands—trampling my courts?
23:1:13:Stop bringing worthless offerings; your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—I cannot endure iniquity along with solemn assemblies.
23:1:14:My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They've become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
23:1:15:When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you. Even if you offer many prayers, I won't listen. Your hands are full of blood.
23:1:16:Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; remove your evil deeds from my sight. Stop doing evil;
23:1:17:learn to do good, seek justice, correct oppression, defend the fatherless, and plead for the widow."
23:1:18:"Come now, let's reason together," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
23:1:19:If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land;
23:1:20:but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
23:1:21:How the faithful city has become a prostitute! Once full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
23:1:22:Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
23:1:23:Your rulers are rebels, friends of thieves. They all love bribes and chase after gifts. They don't defend the fatherless, and the widow's cause never comes before them.
23:1:24:Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries and avenge myself on my enemies.
23:1:25:I will turn my hand against you and refine your dross as with lye, removing all your impurities.
23:1:26:I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward, you will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."
23:1:27:Zion will be redeemed with justice, and her repentant ones with righteousness.
23:1:28:But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the Lord will be consumed.
23:1:29:You will be ashamed of the sacred oaks you desired, and you will be embarrassed by the gardens you've chosen.
23:1:30:For you will be like an oak whose leaves are withering, and like a garden without water.
23:1:31:The strong man will become tinder, and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the flames.
23:2:1:This is the message that Isaiah, son of Amoz, received about Judah and Jerusalem:
23:2:2:In the last days, the mountain where the Lord's temple stands will be established as the highest of all mountains, exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
23:2:3:Many peoples will come and say, "Let's go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so we may walk in his paths." For the law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
23:2:4:He will judge between the nations and settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
23:2:5:Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord!
23:2:6:For you have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs.
23:2:7:Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
23:2:8:Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
23:2:9:So humanity will be brought low, and everyone humbled—do not forgive them!
23:2:10:Go into the rocks and hide in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty!
23:2:11:The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled, and human pride brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
23:2:12:For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low;
23:2:13:against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
23:2:14:against all the high mountains, and against all the uplifted hills;
23:2:15:against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
23:2:16:against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
23:2:17:The arrogance of humanity will be brought low and human pride humbled; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day,
23:2:18:and the idols will utterly vanish.
23:2:19:People will flee to caves in the rocks and holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.
23:2:20:In that day, people will throw away their idols of silver and gold—the idols they made to worship—to the moles and bats,
23:2:21:as they go into the caverns of the rocks and the crevices of the cliffs, away from the terror of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.
23:2:22:Stop trusting in mere humans, who have but a breath in their nostrils. Why hold them in esteem?
23:3:1:Look now, the Lord, the Almighty, is about to remove support and provision from Jerusalem and Judah: every supply of bread and water,
23:3:2:the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the diviner and elder,
23:3:3:the captain of fifty and the honorable man, the counselor and skilled craftsman, and the expert in charms.
23:3:4:I will make young people their leaders; children will rule over them.
23:3:5:People will oppress one another, each against his neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, and the dishonorable against the honorable.
23:3:6:When someone grabs hold of his brother in his father's house, saying, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"
23:3:7:In that day he will protest, "I am not a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak. Don't make me the leader of the people."
23:3:8:For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen because their words and deeds are against the Lord, defying His glorious presence.
23:3:9:The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they don't even try to hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.
23:3:10:Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
23:3:11:Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.
23:3:12:My people, your oppressors are children, and women rule over you. My people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.
23:3:13:The Lord takes His stand to judge, and stands to judge the people.
23:3:14:The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people: "It is you who have devoured the vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
23:3:15:What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the Almighty.
23:3:16:The Lord says, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet,
23:3:17:therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion, and the Lord will make their scalps bald."
23:3:18:In that day the Lord will remove the finery of the anklets, headbands, crescent necklaces,
23:3:19:the earrings, bracelets, veils,
23:3:20:the headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume bottles, amulets,
23:3:21:the signet rings and nose rings,
23:3:22:the fine robes, capes, cloaks, purses,
23:3:23:mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
23:3:24:Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
23:3:25:Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.
23:3:26:The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
23:4:1:In that day, seven women will take hold of one man, saying, "We'll provide our own food and clothing; just let us be called by your name to take away our disgrace."
23:4:2:On that day, the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and honor of the survivors in Israel.
23:4:3:Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy—all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
23:4:4:The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
23:4:5:Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything, the glory will be a canopy.
23:4:6:A shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
23:5:1:Let me sing a song about my beloved, a love song about his vineyard. My dear friend had a vineyard on a fertile hill.
23:5:2:He dug it up and cleared the stones, then planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in the middle and carved out a winepress. He expected it to produce good grapes, but it only yielded wild grapes.
23:5:3:Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
23:5:4:What more could I have done for my vineyard that I haven't already done? When I expected good grapes, why did it produce wild ones?
23:5:5:Listen, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
23:5:6:I will make it a wasteland; it won't be pruned or hoed, and thorns and briers will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.
23:5:7:The vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are the garden of his delight. He expected justice, but saw bloodshed; righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
23:5:8:Woe to those who join house to house and field to field until there's no room left and they live alone in the land!
23:5:9:The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing: Surely many houses will become desolate, large and beautiful ones, without occupants.
23:5:10:A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, and a homer of seed will yield just an ephah of grain.
23:5:11:Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after strong drink, who stay up late at night until they are inflamed with wine!
23:5:12:They have harps and lyres, tambourines and flutes, and wine at their feasts; but they do not regard the deeds of the Lord or consider the work of his hands.
23:5:13:Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their dignitaries are starving, and their masses parched with thirst.
23:5:14:So the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; the nobles and the masses descend, along with their noise and revelry.
23:5:15:Humanity is humbled, and each person brought low; the eyes of the arrogant are lowered.
23:5:16:But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy through righteousness.
23:5:17:Lambs will graze as if in their own pasture, and strangers will eat among the ruins of the rich.
23:5:18:Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit and wickedness as with cart ropes!
23:5:19:To those who say, "Let God hurry and hasten his work so we may see it; let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come to pass, that we may know it!"
23:5:20:Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
23:5:21:Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight!
23:5:22:Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks!
23:5:23:Who acquit the guilty for a bribe and deny justice to the innocent!
23:5:24:Therefore, as fire consumes the stubble and dry grass collapses in flames, so their roots will decay and their blossoms blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23:5:25:So the Lord's anger burns against his people; he has raised his hand against them and struck them. The mountains shake, and their dead bodies lie like refuse in the streets. Yet his anger is not turned away, and his hand is still raised.
23:5:26:He will raise a banner for distant nations and whistle for them from the ends of the earth. They will come swiftly and speedily.
23:5:27:None among them will be weary or stumble, none will slumber or sleep; no belt will be loosened, nor sandal strap broken.
23:5:28:Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are strung; their horses' hooves seem like flint, and their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
23:5:29:They roar like lions and growl like young lions; they seize their prey and carry it off, with no one to rescue.
23:5:30:In that day, they will roar over their prey like the roaring of the sea. If someone looks at the land, they will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.
23:6:1:In the year that King Uzziah passed away, I saw the Lord seated on a high and exalted throne, with His robe filling the temple.
23:6:2:Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.
23:6:3:They called out to one another, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts! The whole earth is full of His glory!"
23:6:4:The sound of their voices shook the foundations of the doorposts, and the temple was filled with smoke.
23:6:5:Then I said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined! I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
23:6:6:One of the seraphim flew to me, holding a glowing coal taken from the altar with tongs.
23:6:7:He touched my mouth with it and said, "Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt is removed, and your sin is atoned for."
23:6:8:Afterward, I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" So I answered, "Here I am. Send me!"
23:6:9:And He said, "Go and tell this people: 'Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looking, but do not perceive.'
23:6:10:Make the hearts of these people calloused; make their ears dull and their eyes dim, so they cannot see with their eyes, hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
23:6:11:Then I asked, "How long, Lord?" And He replied: "Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants, houses are left deserted, and the land is utterly desolate.
23:6:12:The Lord will drive people far away, leaving the land forsaken.
23:6:13:Though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. Like an oak or a terebinth tree whose stump remains when cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."
23:7:1:In the days when Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, ruled Judah, Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah and king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not overpower it.
23:7:2:When the house of David was told, "Aram has joined forces with Ephraim," Ahaz and his people trembled with fear like trees in a storm.
23:7:3:Then the Lord said to Isaiah, "Go out with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct from the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field.
23:7:4:Tell him, 'Stay calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—Rezin of Aram and the son of Remaliah.
23:7:5:For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, have plotted your ruin, saying,
23:7:6:"Let us invade Judah, tear it apart, and divide it among ourselves, making the son of Tabeel king over it."
23:7:7:But this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "It will not happen; it will not take place.
23:7:8:For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered as a nation.
23:7:9:The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"
23:7:10:Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, saying,
23:7:11:"Ask for a sign from the Lord your God, whether it is in the deepest depths or the highest heights."
23:7:12:But Ahaz replied, "I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test."
23:7:13:Isaiah said, "Listen, house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you also try the patience of my God?
23:7:14:Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
23:7:15:He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
23:7:16:Before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
23:7:17:The Lord will bring on you, your people, and the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—the king of Assyria."
23:7:18:In that day, the Lord will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
23:7:19:They will all come and settle in the steep ravines, in the crevices of the rocks, on all the thornbushes, and at all the water holes.
23:7:20:On that day, the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your head, your body hair, and even the hair on your legs, leaving you completely naked and ashamed.
23:7:21:At that time, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
23:7:22:From the abundance of milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
23:7:23:In that day, every place where there were once a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels will become a wasteland of thorns and briers.
23:7:24:People will go there with bows and arrows because the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.
23:7:25:As for all the hills once cultivated with a hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of thorns and briers; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.
23:8:1:Then the Lord told me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
23:8:2:I called upon faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.
23:8:3:After that, I slept with my wife, the prophetess. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The Lord instructed me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
23:8:4:For before the child knows how to say 'Daddy' or 'Mommy,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
23:8:5:The Lord spoke to me again:
23:8:6:"Because these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,
23:8:7:therefore, the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria with all his power. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks,
23:8:8:and sweep into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, Immanuel!"
23:8:9:Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
23:8:10:Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
23:8:11:This is what the Lord says to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people:
23:8:12:"Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
23:8:13:The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread.
23:8:14:He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare.
23:8:15:Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."
23:8:16:Preserve the teaching of God; entrust his instructions to those who follow me.
23:8:17:I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.
23:8:18:Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23:8:19:When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
23:8:20:Consult God's instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
23:8:21:Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.
23:8:22:Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.
23:9:1:In earlier times, the Lord humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future, He will bring honor to the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, and Galilee of the nations.
23:9:2:The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
23:9:3:You have multiplied the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as with the joy at harvest, as people exult when dividing the spoils.
23:9:4:For You have shattered the yoke of their burden, the bar across their shoulders, and the rod of their oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
23:9:5:Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, fuel for the fire.
23:9:6:For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulders. And He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
23:9:7:Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
23:9:8:The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel.
23:9:9:All the people will know it—Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria—who say with pride and arrogance of heart:
23:9:10:"The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars."
23:9:11:But the Lord has strengthened Rezin's foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
23:9:12:Aram from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
23:9:13:But the people have not returned to Him who struck them, nor have they sought the Lord Almighty.
23:9:14:So the Lord will cut off from Israel both head and tail, palm branch and reed in a single day;
23:9:15:the elders and dignitaries are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
23:9:16:Those who guide these people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray.
23:9:17:Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in their young men, nor will He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks folly. Yet for all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
23:9:18:For wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
23:9:19:By the wrath of the Lord Almighty, the land is scorched, and the people are fuel for the fire; they spare no one another.
23:9:20:On the right they devour, but still are hungry; on the left they eat, but are not satisfied. Each one eats the flesh of their own arm:
23:9:21:Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh. Together they turn against Judah. Yet for all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
23:10:1:Woe to those who make unjust laws, and to those who write oppressive decrees,
23:10:2:to deprive the needy of their rights, and to withhold justice from the poor of my people; making widows their prey, and robbing the fatherless.
23:10:3:What will you do on the day of reckoning, when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?
23:10:4:Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives or fall among the slain. Despite all this, his anger is not turned away; his hand is still raised.
23:10:5:Ah, Assyria! The rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my fury!
23:10:6:I will send him against a godless nation, and against the people of my wrath I will give him charge, to seize the spoils, to carry off plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
23:10:7:But this is not what he intends, nor does he have such a plan in mind; his purpose is to destroy, to put an end to many nations.
23:10:8:For he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?
23:10:9:Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
23:10:10:As my hand has reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
23:10:11:shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her idols as I dealt with Samaria and her images?"
23:10:12:When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, "I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes."
23:10:13:For he says, "By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one, I subdued their kings.
23:10:14:As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as people gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp."
23:10:15:Does the ax raise itself above the person who swings it, or the saw boast against the one who uses it? As if a rod were to wield the person who lifts it up, or a club brandish the one who is not wood!
23:10:16:Therefore, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp, a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame.
23:10:17:The Light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers.
23:10:18:The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick person wastes away.
23:10:19:And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down.
23:10:20:In that day, the remnant of Israel, the survivors of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
23:10:21:A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
23:10:22:Though your people, Israel, be like the sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous.
23:10:23:The Lord, the LORD Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
23:10:24:Therefore, this is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: "My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.
23:10:25:Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction."
23:10:26:The LORD Almighty will lash them with a whip, as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt.
23:10:27:In that day, their burden will be lifted from your shoulders, their yoke from your neck; the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat.
23:10:28:They enter Aiath; they pass through Migron; they store supplies at Michmash.
23:10:29:They go over the pass, and say, "We will camp overnight at Geba." Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
23:10:30:Cry out, Daughter Gallim! Listen, Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
23:10:31:Madmenah is in flight; the people of Gebim take cover.
23:10:32:This day they will halt at Nob; they will shake their fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
23:10:33:See, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will lop off the boughs with great power. The lofty trees will be felled, the tall ones will be brought low.
23:10:34:He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax; Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
23:11:1:A shoot will sprout from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
23:11:2:The Spirit of the Lord will rest upon him—wisdom and understanding, counsel and might, knowledge and reverence for the Lord.
23:11:3:He will delight in obeying the Lord, and he won't judge by what he sees or decide by what he hears.
23:11:4:With fairness, he'll judge the poor and make just decisions for the meek of the earth. He'll strike the land with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips, he'll slay the wicked.
23:11:5:Righteousness will be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the sash around his hips.
23:11:6:Wolves and lambs will live together peacefully; leopards will lie down with young goats, calves and lions together, and a little child will lead them.
23:11:7:Cows and bears will graze side by side, while their young ones rest together. Lions will eat straw like oxen.
23:11:8:Infants will play near the cobra's den, and young children will put their hands into the viper's nest.
23:11:9:No one will harm or destroy anything on my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
23:11:10:In that day, the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for all people. Nations will seek him out, and his resting place will be glorious.
23:11:11:On that day, the Lord will reach out again to reclaim the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea.
23:11:12:He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
23:11:13:Ephraim's jealousy will vanish, and Judah's adversaries will be destroyed. Ephraim won't be jealous of Judah, and Judah won't harass Ephraim.
23:11:14:They'll swoop down on the Philistine hills to the west, plundering the people to the east. They'll lay their hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will obey them.
23:11:15:The Lord will dry up the Gulf of Suez and split the Euphrates into seven streams so that people can cross it in sandals.
23:11:16:There will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from Assyria, just as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt.
23:12:1:On that day, you will say, "I thank you, LORD! Though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away, and now you comfort me.
23:12:2:Look, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD himself, is my strength and my song; he has become my savior."
23:12:3:With joy, you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
23:12:4:In that day, you will say, "Praise the LORD, call upon his name; declare his deeds among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted.
23:12:5:Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; let this be known throughout the earth.
23:12:6:Cry out and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst."
23:13:1:This is a message about Babylon, which Isaiah son of Amoz received in a vision:
23:13:2:Raise a signal on a bare hilltop; call out to them. Wave your hand so they can enter the gates of the nobles.
23:13:3:I have commanded my chosen ones; I have summoned my warriors to execute my wrath—those who rejoice in my triumph.
23:13:4:Hear the noise on the mountains! It's like a large crowd! Hear the uproar among the kingdoms—the nations assembling! The Lord of Hosts is mustering an army for battle.
23:13:5:They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens—the Lord and the weapons of his wrath—to destroy the whole country.
23:13:6:Wail, for the day of the Lord is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
23:13:7:Therefore, all hands will go limp, and every human heart will melt with fear.
23:13:8:Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they'll be in agony like a woman giving birth. They'll look at each other in shock, their faces aflame.
23:13:9:See, the day of the Lord is coming—a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger—to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
23:13:10:The stars of heaven and their constellations won't show their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon won't give its light.
23:13:11:I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud and humble the haughtiness of the ruthless.
23:13:12:I will make people scarcer than pure gold, and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir.
23:13:13:Therefore, I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the Lord of Hosts on the day of his fierce anger.
23:13:14:Like a hunted gazelle or a flock without a shepherd, everyone will return to their own people, flee to their native land.
23:13:15:Whoever is captured will be pierced through; those who are caught will fall by the sword.
23:13:16:Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted, and their wives violated.
23:13:17:See, I will stir up the Medes against them, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.
23:13:18:Their bows will strike down the young men; they'll have no mercy on infants nor compassion for children.
23:13:19:Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the pride and glory of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
23:13:20:It will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no nomad will pitch their tent there, no shepherd will rest their flocks there.
23:13:21:But desert creatures will lie down there, and their houses will be full of howling creatures; owls will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.
23:13:22:Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Babylon's time is near, and her days won't be prolonged.
23:14:1: The Lord will show mercy to Jacob and choose Israel again, settling them in their own land. Foreigners will join them, uniting with the people of Jacob.
23:14:2: Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. The people of Israel will possess these nations as servants and maids in the land of the Lord. They will capture those who once held them captive and rule over their oppressors.
23:14:3: When the Lord gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard labor you were forced into,
23:14:4: you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon: "How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!
23:14:5: The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of rulers,
23:14:6: which struck the peoples in anger with unceasing blows, ruling the nations in fury with relentless persecution.
23:14:7: The whole earth is at rest and quiet; they break forth into singing.
23:14:8: Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, 'Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us.'
23:14:9: The realm of the dead below is stirred up to meet you when you arrive; it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—all those who were leaders in the world; it makes them rise from their thrones—all those who were kings over the nations.
23:14:10: They will all respond, saying to you, 'You too have become weak as we are; you have become like us.'
23:14:11: Your pomp and the music of your harps have been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your feasts; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.
23:14:12: How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!
23:14:13: You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.
23:14:14: I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'
23:14:15: But you will be brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.
23:14:16: Those who see you will stare at you, pondering over you: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble,
23:14:17: who turned the world into a desert, and destroyed its cities, who never let his captives go home?'
23:14:18: All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
23:14:19: But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch, covered by those slain with the sword, and dumped into a rocky pit.
23:14:20: You will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will never be mentioned again.
23:14:21: Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the sins of their ancestors; they must not rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.
23:14:22: "I will rise up against them," declares the Lord Almighty. "I will wipe out Babylon's name and survivors, her offspring and descendants," declares the Lord.
23:14:23: I will turn her into a place for owls and a swamp; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction," declares the Lord Almighty.
23:14:24: The Lord Almighty has sworn, "Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand.
23:14:25: I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains, I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders."
23:14:26: This is the plan determined for the whole earth; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
23:14:27: For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?
23:14:28: In the year that King Ahaz died, this message came:
23:14:29: Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, and its offspring will be a darting, venomous serpent.
23:14:30: The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But I will put an end to your root by famine, and I will slay your survivors.
23:14:31: Wail, you city gate! Cry out, you city! Melt away, all you Philistines! For a cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
23:14:32: What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? "The Lord has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge."
23:15:1:This is a message about Moab: In one night, the city of Ar has been destroyed; Moab is left in ruins.
23:15:2:The people of Moab go to the high places to weep. They mourn for the cities of Nebo and Medeba; their heads are shaved, and their beards are cut off.
23:15:3:In the streets, they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and public squares, everyone cries and falls down in grief.
23:15:4:Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices can be heard as far as Jahaz. The soldiers of Moab tremble with fear; their hearts are filled with anguish.
23:15:5:My heart aches for Moab; its people flee to Zoar, which was once like a beautiful young heifer. They struggle uphill to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim, they cry out in despair.
23:15:6:The waters of Nimrim have dried up, leaving the grass withered, the plants dead, and no greenery remaining.
23:15:7:So the people gather what they have left and carry it across the Brook of Willows.
23:15:8:Cries of despair echo throughout Moab's border as far as Eglaim and Beer-elim.
23:15:9:The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring even more upon Dimon—a lion will come upon those who escape from Moab and upon the survivors in the land.
23:16:1:Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Sela, across the desert, to the mountain of Daughter Zion.
23:16:2:Like fluttering birds forced from their nests, so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon River.
23:16:3:Give us advice; make a decision. Cast your shadow like the night in the midst of noonday; hide the refugees; don't betray the one who escapes.
23:16:4:Let the exiles from Moab find shelter among you; be a hiding place for them from the destroyer. For the oppressor will come to an end, and destruction will cease; the aggressor will vanish from the land.
23:16:5:In love, a throne will be established, and one will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging and seeking justice, and swift to do what is right.
23:16:6:We have heard of Moab's pride—how very proud they are—of their arrogance, their pride, and their insolence; but their boasts are empty.
23:16:7:Therefore the people of Moab will wail; they will mourn for Moab. Everyone will grieve for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
23:16:8:The fields of Heshbon wither, and the vines of Sibmah as well; the rulers of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and passed over the sea.
23:16:9:So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. I drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouts of joy over your summer fruits and harvest have been silenced.
23:16:10:Gladness and joy are taken away from the orchards; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the joyful shouting.
23:16:11:Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp, and my soul mourns for Kir Hareseth.
23:16:12:When Moab appears on the high place and wearies himself, he will enter his sanctuary to pray, but it will not avail.
23:16:13:This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab in the past.
23:16:14:But now the Lord says, "Within three years, as a hired worker counts the years, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of its great multitude; and those who remain will be very few and feeble."
23:17:1:This is a message about Damascus: "Look, Damascus will no longer be a city; it will become a heap of ruins.
23:17:2:The cities of Aroer will be deserted; they will be places for flocks to lie down, with no one to disturb them.
23:17:3:Ephraim's stronghold will disappear, and the kingdom of Damascus will cease to exist. The survivors of Aram will share the same fate as Israel," declares the Lord Almighty.
23:17:4:"In that day, the splendor of Jacob will fade, and the fatness of his flesh will grow thin.
23:17:5:It will be as when a farmer gathers the standing grain and harvests the ears with his arm; as when one gleans the ears of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
23:17:6:Only a few will be left, like an olive tree beaten for its fruit: two or three olives at the very top, four or five on the fruitful branches," declares the Lord, the God of Israel.
23:17:7:In that day, people will turn to their Maker and lift their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
23:17:8:They will not look to the altars they made with their own hands, nor will they regard the Asherah poles and incense altars their fingers have crafted.
23:17:9:On that day, their strong cities will be like the abandoned settlements of the Hivites and Amorites, which were deserted when the Israelites approached; they will become desolate.
23:17:10:For you have forgotten the God who saves you and have not remembered the Rock, your fortress. You plant lovely plants and import foreign vines;
23:17:11:on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, they take root. But the harvest vanishes in a day of grief and desperate pain.
23:17:12:Ah, the uproar of many peoples! They roar like the roaring seas; the tumult of nations rises like the mighty waves.
23:17:13:Nations will surge like the surging waters, but God will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, driven like chaff on the mountains before the wind, like tumbleweed before a storm.
23:17:14:In the evening, there is sudden terror; before morning, they are gone. This is the fate of those who plunder us, the destiny of those who rob us.
23:18:1:Listen up, land of whirring wings that lies beyond the rivers of Cush!
23:18:2:You who send ambassadors by sea, in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, a powerful and oppressive nation whose land the rivers divide.
23:18:3:All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet sounds, listen!
23:18:4:For this is what the LORD has told me: "I will quietly watch from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
23:18:5:Before the harvest, when the blossoms are gone and the flowers become ripening grapes, He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and remove and discard the branches.
23:18:6:They will be left for the birds of prey on the mountain tops, and for the wild animals in the land. The birds will feed on them all summer, and the wild animals all winter.
23:18:7:At that time, gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a nation feared far and wide, a powerful and oppressive nation whose land the rivers divide—gifts to the place where the Name of the LORD Almighty dwells on Mount Zion.
23:19:1:Look, the Lord rides a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
23:19:2:I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian—brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
23:19:3:The spirit of the Egyptians will be drained within them, and I will destroy their counsel. They will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.
23:19:4:I will hand the Egyptians over to a harsh master, and a powerful king will rule over them," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
23:19:5:The waters of the Nile will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and empty.
23:19:6:The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither,
23:19:7:and the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river, will wither away, blown away by the wind and no longer found there.
23:19:8:The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who spread nets on the water will suffer loss.
23:19:9:Those who work with combed flax will be dismayed, and the weavers of fine linen will be disheartened.
23:19:10:The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.
23:19:11:The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings"?
23:19:12:Where are your wise men now? Let them show you and make known what the LORD Almighty has planned against Egypt.
23:19:13:The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray.
23:19:14:The LORD has poured into them a spirit of confusion. They have misled Egypt in all that it does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
23:19:15:There is nothing Egypt can do—head or tail, palm branch or reed.
23:19:16:In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear before the hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them.
23:19:17:The land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone who mentions it will be terrified, because of the plan the LORD Almighty has determined against them.
23:19:18:In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.
23:19:19:In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border.
23:19:20:It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, who will rescue them.
23:19:21:The LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them.
23:19:22:The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
23:19:23:In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
23:19:24:In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.
23:19:25:The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance."
23:20:1:In the year when King Sargon of Assyria sent his general to capture the Philistine city of Ashdod,
23:20:2:the LORD spoke through Isaiah, son of Amoz, saying, "Go, remove your sackcloth and take off your sandals." And Isaiah did as he was told, walking around naked and barefoot.
23:20:3:Then the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a symbol against Egypt and Cush,
23:20:4:so will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks exposed, bringing shame upon them.
23:20:5:Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and ashamed.
23:20:6:In that day, the people who live along this coast will say, 'Look at what has happened to our source of hope, to those we fled for help and protection from the king of Assyria! How can we escape now?'"
23:21:1: A message about the desert by the sea: As whirlwinds sweep through the Negev, it comes from the desert, from a terrifying land.
23:21:2: A distressing vision is revealed to me: The traitor betrays, and the plunderer plunders. Go up, Elam! Lay siege, Media! I will put an end to all her groaning.
23:21:3: Therefore, my heart is filled with anguish; pain grips me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am too disturbed to hear, too frightened to see.
23:21:4: My mind reels, fear overwhelms me; the twilight I longed for has turned into trembling for me.
23:21:5: They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Rise up, you princes, and oil the shield!
23:21:6: For this is what the Lord said to me: "Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
23:21:7: When he sees riders, pairs of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, let him pay close attention, very close attention."
23:21:8: Then the lookout shouted, "Lord, I stand on the watchtower all day, and I stay at my post throughout the night.
23:21:9: Look, here come riders, horsemen in pairs." And one answered, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!"
23:21:10: O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I bring you good news from the LORD Almighty.
23:21:11: A message about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?"
23:21:12: The watchman replies, "Morning has come, but also the night. If you would inquire, inquire; come back again."
23:21:13: A message about Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia, you caravans of Dedanites will find shelter.
23:21:14: Bring water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of Tema, meet the fugitives with food.
23:21:15: For they have fled from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and the heat of battle.
23:21:16: For this is what the Lord said to me: "Within a year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
23:21:17: The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
23:22:1:This is the message concerning the Valley of Vision: What troubles you now, that you've all gone up to the rooftops?
23:22:2:You who were once full of noise, a bustling city, now lie fallen; your slain are not slain by the sword, nor dead in battle.
23:22:3:All your rulers have fled together, without the bow they were captured; all who were found were taken prisoner, though they had fled far away.
23:22:4:Therefore I said, "Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly; don't try to console me over the destruction of my people."
23:22:5:For it is a day of trouble, defeat, and confusion from the Lord God of Hosts in the Valley of Vision, a day when walls are broken down and cries for help echo to the mountains.
23:22:6:Elam carries the quiver, with chariots and horsemen; Kir uncovers the shield.
23:22:7:Your choicest valleys are filled with chariots, and the horsemen take their positions at the gates.
23:22:8:Judah's defenses are stripped away, and you look to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
23:22:9:You see the breaches in the walls of the City of David, and you gather the waters of the lower pool.
23:22:10:You count the houses of Jerusalem and tear some down to fortify the wall.
23:22:11:You also make a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool, but you do not look to the One who made it or consider the One who planned it long ago.
23:22:12:On that day, the Lord God of Hosts called for weeping and mourning, for shaved heads and wearing sackcloth.
23:22:13:But instead, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine, as people say, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"
23:22:14:The Lord of Hosts has revealed this in my hearing: "Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for until you die," says the Lord God of Hosts.
23:22:15:This is what the Lord God of Hosts says: "Go to the steward, Shebna, who is in charge of the palace, and say to him:
23:22:16:'What are you doing here, and who gave you permission to carve out a tomb for yourself, cutting a resting place in the rock?'
23:22:17:Behold, the Lord will throw you out, O mighty man, and seize you firmly.
23:22:18:He will roll you up tightly like a ball and hurl you into a wide, open land; there you will die, and there your splendid chariots will remain, a disgrace to your master's house.
23:22:19:I will remove you from your office, and you will be ousted from your position.
23:22:20:On that day, I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah,
23:22:21:and I will clothe him with your robe, fasten your sash around him, and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
23:22:22:I will place the key of David's house on his shoulder; when he opens, no one can shut, and when he shuts, no one can open.
23:22:23:I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of honor for his father's house.
23:22:24:They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the posterity, every small vessel, from the cups to all the pitchers.
23:22:25:On that day," declares the Lord of Hosts, "the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be cut down and fall, and the load hanging on it will be destroyed." For the Lord has spoken.
23:23:1:This is a message about Tyre: Wail, you ships of Tarshish! Your harbor is destroyed and there's no house or safe place to enter from the land of Kittim.
23:23:2:Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, who crossed the sea in great ships.
23:23:3:The vast waters brought grain from Egypt; the harvest of the Nile was her income, and she became the marketplace of nations.
23:23:4:Be ashamed, Sidon, because the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, "I have not been in labor or given birth, nor have I raised young men or brought up young women."
23:23:5:When the report reaches Egypt, they will be in anguish at the news about Tyre.
23:23:6:Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you inhabitants of the coastland.
23:23:7:Is this your joyous city, whose origin is from ancient times, whose feet carried her far away to settle in distant lands?
23:23:8:Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes and whose traders are renowned on earth?
23:23:9:The Lord of Hosts has planned it, to defile the pride of all beauty, to bring low the honored of the earth.
23:23:10:Overflow your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint anymore.
23:23:11:He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms; the Lord has given a command concerning Canaan to destroy its strongholds.
23:23:12:He said, "You shall rejoice no more, oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Kittim; even there you will find no rest."
23:23:13:Look at the land of the Chaldeans, a people who no longer exist. Assyria destined it for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, stripped its palaces, and turned it into a ruin.
23:23:14:Wail, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is destroyed!
23:23:15:In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. After seventy years, the song of the prostitute will be about Tyre:
23:23:16:"Take a harp, go around the city, forgotten prostitute! Play skillfully, sing many songs, so you may be remembered."
23:23:17:After the seventy years, the Lord will visit Tyre, and she will return to her lucrative prostitution and will trade with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23:23:18:Her profits and wages will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord, providing abundant food and fine clothing.
23:24:1:Look, the Lord is going to devastate the earth and leave it in ruins; He will scatter its inhabitants.
23:24:2:It will be the same for people and priests, for slaves and masters, for maids and mistresses, for buyers and sellers, for borrowers and lenders, for debtors and creditors.
23:24:3:The earth will be utterly laid waste and completely plundered, for the Lord has spoken this word.
23:24:4:The earth mourns and withers; the world fades and grows weak. The exalted of the earth languish.
23:24:5:The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.
23:24:6:Therefore, a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. That's why the earth's inhabitants dwindle, and very few are left.
23:24:7:The new wine dries up, the vine withers; all who used to be merry-hearted now groan.
23:24:8:The joyful tambourines cease, the noise of revelers ends, the joyful harp falls silent.
23:24:9:They no longer sing and drink wine; strong drink tastes bitter to those who consume it.
23:24:10:Broken cities lie in ruins; every house is shut up so that none can enter.
23:24:11:People cry out for wine in the streets; all joy turns to gloom, and happiness is banished from the earth.
23:24:12:The city lies desolate, and its gate is battered to pieces.
23:24:13:This is how it will be on earth among the nations, like the harvesting of olives or the gleaning of grapes after the grape harvest.
23:24:14:They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west, they acclaim the Lord's majesty.
23:24:15:Therefore, in the east give glory to the Lord; exalt the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.
23:24:16:From the ends of the earth, we hear songs of praise, "Glory to the Righteous One." But I said, "I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery, the treacherous betray!"
23:24:17:Terror, pit, and snare await you, people of the earth.
23:24:18:Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.
23:24:19:The earth is utterly broken apart, the earth is split open, the earth is violently shaken.
23:24:20:The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; its transgression weighs it down, and it falls, never to rise again.
23:24:21:In that day, the Lord will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.
23:24:22:They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and punished after many days.
23:24:23:The moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed, for the Lord Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, He will display His glory.
23:25:1:O Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
23:25:2:You have turned cities into ruins, strongholds into rubble; the city of chaos is silenced, never to be rebuilt.
23:25:3:Therefore, strong nations will honor you; ruthless nations will revere you.
23:25:4:You have been a refuge for the poor, a shelter in the storm, a shade from the heat; for the breath of the ruthless is like a rainstorm against a wall.
23:25:5:Like the scorching heat in a dry land, you subdue the noise of foreigners; as heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced.
23:25:6:On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine, the best meats and the finest wines.
23:25:7:He will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet covering all nations;
23:25:8:He will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from every face, and remove his people's disgrace from the whole earth, for the Lord has spoken.
23:25:9:In that day, they will say, "Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the Lord, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation."
23:25:10:The hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.
23:25:11:Moab will stretch out their hands in the midst of them, as a swimmer stretches out his hands to swim; but the Lord will lay low their pride, together with the spoils of their hands.
23:25:12:He will bring down your high fortified walls, and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the dust.
23:26:1:In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; God has set up salvation as its walls and defenses.
23:26:2:Open the gates so that the righteous nation, which remains faithful, may enter.
23:26:3:You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you.
23:26:4:Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal.
23:26:5:He humbles those who dwell on high, bringing down the lofty city; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.
23:26:6:The feet of the oppressed and the footsteps of the poor will trample it down.
23:26:7:The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth.
23:26:8:Yes, Lord, walking in your ways, we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.
23:26:9:My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.
23:26:10:Though grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness, they continue to do evil, and they do not regard the majesty of the Lord.
23:26:11:Lord, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.
23:26:12:Lord, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished, you have done for us.
23:26:13:O Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.
23:26:14:They are now dead, they live no more; their spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.
23:26:15:You have enlarged the nation, O Lord; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land.
23:26:16:Lord, in distress they sought you; they poured out a whispered prayer when your discipline was upon them.
23:26:17:As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, Lord.
23:26:18:We were with child, we writhed in labor, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the people of the world have not come to life.
23:26:19:But your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise—let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy—your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.
23:26:20:Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.
23:26:21:See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed on it; the earth will conceal its slain no longer.
23:27:1:In that day, the Lord will punish Leviathan, the fleeing serpent, with His fierce and mighty sword. He will slay the dragon that lives in the sea.
23:27:2:At that time, a delightful vineyard will be sung about. This is the song:
23:27:3:"I, the Lord, watch over my vineyard; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one can harm it.
23:27:4:I am not angry. If there were thorns and briers confronting me, I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.
23:27:5:Or let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."
23:27:6:In days to come, Jacob will take root; Israel will bud and blossom and fill the world with fruit.
23:27:7:Has the Lord struck Israel as He struck those who struck them? Or has Israel been killed like their killers?
23:27:8:By driving her away and punishing her, You contended with her. He removed her with His fierce wind in the day of the east wind.
23:27:9:So in this way, Jacob's guilt will be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of removing his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like crushed chalk stones, so that Asherah poles and incense altars will not stand.
23:27:10:The fortified city will be desolate, an abandoned pasture, a forsaken wilderness where calves will graze and lie down, and they will consume its branches.
23:27:11:When its limbs are dry, they will be broken off; women will come and use them for firewood. For this is a people without understanding; therefore, their Maker will not have compassion on them, and their Creator will not show them favor.
23:27:12:In that day, the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.
23:27:13:On that day, a great trumpet will sound, and those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
23:28:1:Woe to the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim! Their glorious beauty is fading like a flower that withers on the head of those who are overcome by wine.
23:28:2:Look, the Lord has one strong and mighty; like a hailstorm, a destructive tempest, like a flood of mighty waters overflowing. He will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
23:28:3:The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled underfoot.
23:28:4:The fading flower, their glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, will become like an early fig before summer; whoever sees it will swallow it up as soon as it is in hand.
23:28:5:In that day, the Lord of Hosts will become a beautiful crown and a glorious wreath for the remnant of his people,
23:28:6:A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, and strength for those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
23:28:7:But even these stagger from wine and reel from strong drink; priests and prophets are confused by alcohol, they're swallowed up by strong drink. They stagger from intoxication, their visions are blurred, and they stumble when rendering judgment.
23:28:8:All tables are covered with vomit and filth, no place is clean.
23:28:9:Who does he think he's teaching? Who can understand his message? Are we just weaned infants, recently taken from the breast?
23:28:10:He gives orders, precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little.
23:28:11:Indeed, with stammering lips and a foreign tongue, he will speak to this people,
23:28:12:To whom he has said, "This is the place of rest; give rest to the weary, this is the place of repose." But they would not listen.
23:28:13:So the word of the Lord will be to them, precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little, so that when they walk, they may stumble and fall backward, and be broken, snared, and captured.
23:28:14:Hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem!
23:28:15:You've said, "We've made a covenant with death and an agreement with the grave. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, it won't come to us, for we have made lies our refuge and falsehood our hiding place."
23:28:16:Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "I am laying a tested stone in Zion, a precious cornerstone, a firm foundation. Whoever believes will not be in haste.
23:28:17:I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and water will overflow your hiding place.
23:28:18:Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it.
23:28:19:As often as it comes, it will seize you; morning after morning, day and night, it will pass through." This is the understanding given to those who hear.
23:28:20:The bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow to wrap around oneself.
23:28:21:For the Lord will rise up as at Mount Perazim, and he will be angry as in the Valley of Gibeon, to do his work, his unusual work, and to perform his task, his extraordinary task.
23:28:22:Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier. The Lord, the God of Hosts, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
23:28:23:Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.
23:28:24:Does a farmer plow all day to sow seed? Does he continually break up and work the soil?
23:28:25:When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, sow cumin, and plant wheat in rows, barley in its plot, and spelt at its border?
23:28:26:His God instructs him in the right way and teaches him.
23:28:27:Dill is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cumin. But dill is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
23:28:28:Bread grain is crushed, but not endlessly
23:28:29:The farmer knows when to stop threshing, for he does not keep driving his horses over the grain. He separates it out with care.
23:28:30:This also comes from the Lord of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
23:29:1:Woe to Ariel, the city where David camped! Year after year, let your festivals continue.
23:29:2:But I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and sorrow; it will become like an altar hearth before me.
23:29:3:I will encircle you, O Ariel, and lay siege against you with towers and raise siege works against you.
23:29:4:You will be brought low, speaking from the ground, and your words will come as a whisper from the dust; your voice will be like that of a ghost, and your speech will whisper out of the earth.
23:29:5:Yet the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust, and the horde of the ruthless like chaff blown away; suddenly, in an instant,
23:29:6:the Lord Almighty will come with thunder, earthquake, great noise, whirlwind, tempest, and flames of devouring fire.
23:29:7:Then all the nations fighting against Ariel, waging war against her and her fortress, will vanish like a dream, like a vision in the night.
23:29:8:As when a hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up still hungry, or a thirsty person dreams of drinking but wakes up faint and parched, so will it be for the multitude of nations that fight against Mount Zion.
23:29:9:Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not from strong drink.
23:29:10:For the Lord has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes, the prophets; he has covered your heads, the seers.
23:29:11:And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a sealed book, which when given to one who can read, they say, "Read this," but he replies, "I cannot, for it is sealed."
23:29:12:And if the book is given to someone who cannot read, saying, "Read this," he replies, "I cannot read."
23:29:13:The Lord says, "These people come near to me with their mouths and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
23:29:14:Therefore, I will again do something astonishing and amazing among this people—something extraordinary and wonderful.
23:29:15:Woe to those who go to great lengths to hide their plans from the Lord, who do their deeds in darkness and think, 'Who sees us? Who knows us?'
23:29:16:You have turned things upside down! Can the potter be considered like clay? Can the created thing say about its creator, 'He didn't make me'? Or can the pottery say about the potter, 'He has no understanding'?
23:29:17:In a very short time, Lebanon will turn into a fertile field, and the fertile field will seem like a forest.
23:29:18:On that day, the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of the gloom and darkness, the eyes of the blind will see.
23:29:19:The humble will increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among humanity will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23:29:20:For the ruthless will come to an end, and the mockers will be finished; all who are intent on doing evil will be cut down,
23:29:21:those who accuse others falsely and lay traps for the defender at the city gate, and without reason deny justice to the innocent.
23:29:22:Therefore, this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the descendants of Jacob: "No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale.
23:29:23:For when they see their children, the work of my hands, in their midst, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23:29:24:Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction."
23:30:1:Oh rebellious children, says the Lord, you make plans without consulting me, and form alliances not led by my Spirit, only adding sin upon sin.
23:30:2:You go down to Egypt for help without asking for my advice, seeking shelter under Pharaoh's protection and relying on Egypt's strength.
23:30:3:But Egypt's protection will bring you disappointment, and trusting in their strength will lead to your downfall.
23:30:4:For though their officials are at Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
23:30:5:they will all prove useless to you, unable to provide any help or benefit, only causing shame and disgrace.
23:30:6:A message concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, with dangerous wild animals and deadly snakes, they carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys and their treasures on camels' humps, to a nation that cannot save them.
23:30:7:Egypt's help is utterly worthless; therefore, I call her "Rahab Who Sits Still."
23:30:8:Now go, write it down on a tablet before them, and inscribe it in a book, so that it may serve as a witness for future generations.
23:30:9:For these people are rebellious, deceitful children who refuse to listen to the Lord's instruction.
23:30:10:They tell the prophets, "Do not prophesy to us what is right; speak to us pleasant words, prophesy illusions.
23:30:11:Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
23:30:12:Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: "Because you have rejected this message and relied on oppression and deceit to guide you,
23:30:13:this sin will be like a high, bulging wall that suddenly collapses, breaking into pieces in an instant.
23:30:14:It will shatter like a clay pot, so completely broken that not even a shard will be found for taking coals from the hearth or scooping water from a cistern."
23:30:15:This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says: "In repentance and rest is your salvation; in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it.
23:30:16:You said, 'No, we will flee on horses!' So you will flee. And, 'We will ride off on swift horses!' But those who pursue you will be swifter.
23:30:17:A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five, you will all flee away, until you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill."
23:30:18:Yet the Lord longs to show you mercy; He rises to show you compassion. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for Him!
23:30:19:People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious He will be when you cry for help! As soon as He hears, He will answer you.
23:30:20:Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes, you will see them.
23:30:21:Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."
23:30:22:Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Away with you!"
23:30:23:He will also provide rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your cattle will graze in broad meadows.
23:30:24:The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with a shovel and fork.
23:30:25:On every lofty mountain and every high hill, there will be streams and watercourses in the day of great slaughter when the towers fall.
23:30:26:Moreover, the light of the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day the Lord binds up the brokenness of His people and heals the wounds He inflicted.
23:30:27:See, the Name of the Lord comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; His lips are full of wrath, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.
23:30:28:His breath is like an overflowing torrent, rising up to the neck. He sifts the nations with the sieve of destruction; He places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray.
23:30:29:And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people playing pipes go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.
23:30:30:The Lord will cause people to hear His majestic voice and will make them see His arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.
23:30:31:The voice of the Lord will shatter Assyria; with His scepter, He will strike them down.
23:30:32:Every stroke the Lord lays on them with His punishing club will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as He fights them in battle with the blows of His arm.
23:30:33:Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
23:31:1:Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, relying on horses and trusting in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are strong; but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the Lord!
23:31:2:Yet He is wise and will bring disaster upon them; He will not revoke His words. He will rise against the house of evildoers and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.
23:31:3:Egyptians are human, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the Lord stretches out His hand, the helper will stumble, and the one being helped will fall, and they all will perish together.
23:31:4:For this is what the Lord has said to me: "As a lion or young lion growls over its prey, and when a band of shepherds is called out against it, it is not frightened by their shouting or disturbed by their noise; so will the Lord of Hosts come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
23:31:5:Like birds hovering overhead, the Lord of Hosts will protect Jerusalem; He will shield and deliver it, He will pass over and rescue it."
23:31:6:Turn back to Him from whom you have deeply revolted, O people of Israel.
23:31:7:For in that day, everyone shall reject their idols of silver and gold, which your hands have made as sinful objects.
23:31:8:Then Assyria will fall by a sword not wielded by humans, and a sword not made by humans will consume them. They will flee from the sword, and their young men will be put to forced labor.
23:31:9:Their stronghold will crumble in terror, and their commanders will be terrified at the sight of the battle standard," declares the Lord, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23:32:1:Look, a king will reign in righteousness, and leaders will rule with justice.
23:32:2:Each one will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
23:32:3:The eyes of those who see won't be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen carefully.
23:32:4:The impulsive heart will gain understanding, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.
23:32:5:Fools will no longer be called noble, nor will scoundrels be considered honorable.
23:32:6:For fools speak foolishness, and their hearts plot evil: to practice ungodliness, spread false information about the Lord, leave the hungry unsatisfied, and withhold drinks from the thirsty.
23:32:7:Scoundrels use wicked methods, they devise evil plans to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.
23:32:8:But noble people have noble intentions, and they stand firm in their honorable goals.
23:32:9:Rise up, you women who are at ease; hear my voice, you complacent daughters; listen to what I say.
23:32:10:In little more than a year, you who feel secure will tremble; for the grape harvest will fail, and there will be no fruit.
23:32:11:Shudder, you women who are at ease; tremble, you complacent ones; strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth on your waist.
23:32:12:Mourn for the fields, the delightful fields, and the fruitful vineyards.
23:32:13:Thorns and briars will grow on the land of my people—yes, on all the happy homes in the joyous city.
23:32:14:The palace will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, a delight for wild donkeys, and a pasture for flocks.
23:32:15:But once more, God's Spirit will be poured out upon us from on high, and the wilderness will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will be considered a forest.
23:32:16:Justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
23:32:17:The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.
23:32:18:My people will live in peaceful settlements, in secure homes, and in undisturbed places of rest.
23:32:19:Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,
23:32:20:How blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys roam free.
23:33:1:Oh no! You who plunder, you will be plundered! And you who deal in treachery, they will betray you! When you finish plundering, you'll be plundered yourself; when you're done betraying, you'll be betrayed.
23:33:2:Lord, be gracious to us! We have waited for you. Be our strength every morning, and our salvation in times of trouble.
23:33:3:The sound of your voice makes the nations flee; when you rise, the peoples scatter.
23:33:4:Your spoils will be gathered like locusts; like a swarm of grasshoppers, people rush upon them.
23:33:5:The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high; he fills Zion with justice and righteousness.
23:33:6:He will be the stability of your times, a wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is the key to this treasure.
23:33:7:Listen! Their brave men cry out in the streets; the messengers of peace weep bitterly.
23:33:8:The highways are deserted, travelers have stopped. Treaties are broken, witnesses are despised, and no one is respected.
23:33:9:The land mourns and wastes away; Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel lose their leaves.
23:33:10:Now I will rise, says the Lord, now I will be exalted, now I will lift myself up.
23:33:11:You conceive chaff, you give birth to stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you.
23:33:12:And the people will be burned as if to lime, like thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.
23:33:13:Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge my might.
23:33:14:The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the ungodly: "Who among us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?"
23:33:15:He who walks righteously and speaks honestly; he who rejects gain from extortion and keeps his hand from accepting bribes; he who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—
23:33:16:This person will live on high; their refuge will be a fortress of rocks; they'll be given food and have access to water.
23:33:17:Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches far away.
23:33:18:Your heart will ponder the terror: "Where is the one who counted? Where is the one who weighed? Where is the one who counted the towers?"
23:33:19:You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of obscure speech which you cannot comprehend, stammering in a language you do not understand.
23:33:20:Look upon Zion, the city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem as a peaceful abode, a tent that won't be moved; its stakes will never be pulled up, nor any of its ropes broken.
23:33:21:There the Lord will be our Mighty One. It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams, where no galley with oars will go, nor majestic ships pass by.
23:33:22:For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; it is he who will save us.
23:33:23:Your ropes hang loose; they cannot hold the mast firm in its place or keep the sail spread out. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder.
23:33:24:No one living in Zion will say, "I am sick"; the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
23:34:1:Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth and everything in it hear, as well as the world and all its inhabitants.
23:34:2:For the LORD is angry with all nations and furious with all their armies. He will utterly destroy them and give them over to slaughter.
23:34:3:Their slain will be left unburied, and the stench of their corpses will fill the land; the mountains will flow with their blood.
23:34:4:All the stars in the sky will dissolve, and the heavens will roll up like a scroll. All the celestial bodies will fall like withered leaves from a vine, or shriveled figs from a fig tree.
23:34:5:When my sword has finished its work in the heavens, it will descend upon Edom, the people I have marked for destruction.
23:34:6:The sword of the LORD is drenched in blood, covered with fat—the blood of lambs and goats, the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD is preparing a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23:34:7:Wild oxen will fall with them, young bulls with powerful ones. Their land will be soaked with blood, and their soil saturated with fat.
23:34:8:This is the day of the LORD's vengeance, the year of retribution for Zion's cause.
23:34:9:Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into burning sulfur; its land will become blazing pitch!
23:34:10:It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation, it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.
23:34:11:Owls and crows will possess the land, and the LORD will stretch out over it the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.
23:34:12:Nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom, and all its rulers will vanish.
23:34:13:Thorns will overrun its palaces, nettles and brambles its strongholds. It will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.
23:34:14:Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; night creatures will also rest there and find themselves places of repose.
23:34:15:The owl will nest there and lay eggs, hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there too the falcons will gather, each with its mate.
23:34:16:Search in the book of the LORD and read: Not one of these creatures will be missing, none will lack its mate. For the LORD has commanded it, and His Spirit will gather them together.
23:34:17:He allots their portions; His hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.
23:35:1:Look, the wilderness and the dry land will rejoice; the desert will bloom and be glad.
23:35:2:Yes, it will burst into bloom, and sing with joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, along with the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will witness the majesty of the Lord, and the excellence of our God.
23:35:3:Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees.
23:35:4:Tell those who are anxious, "Be strong, don't fear! Your God is coming, bringing vengeance and divine retribution. He will save you."
23:35:5:Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
23:35:6:The lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy. For in the wilderness, water will break forth, and streams in the desert.
23:35:7:The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground will turn into springs. In the haunt of jackals, where they lay, there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus.
23:35:8:A highway will be there, a road called the Way of Holiness. The unclean won't travel on it, but it will be for those who walk in that way. Even fools won't go astray.
23:35:9:No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast will go up on it. They won't be found there, but the redeemed will walk there.
23:35:10:Those whom the Lord has saved will return and enter Zion with singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Gladness and joy will overtake them, while sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23:36:1:In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23:36:2:From Lachish, the king of Assyria sent his chief officer to Jerusalem with a large army. They arrived at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field.
23:36:3:Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet him.
23:36:4:The chief officer said to them, "Tell Hezekiah that the great king, the king of Assyria, asks: 'What gives you confidence in your defenses?'
23:36:5:I've heard you say you have a strategy and military strength, but these are just empty words. Who do you think will help you rebel against me?
23:36:6:You're relying on Egypt, but it's like a splintered staff that pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. That's what Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is like for all who trust in him.
23:36:7:Maybe you'll say, 'We trust in the LORD our God.' But isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, telling Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship only at this altar'?
23:36:8:Now, make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I'll give you two thousand horses if you can find enough riders for them.
23:36:9:How could you possibly defeat even one of my master's officers? You're counting on Egypt for chariots and horsemen!
23:36:10:Furthermore, do you think I've attacked your land without the LORD's guidance? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it."
23:36:11:Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief officer, "Please speak to us in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak Hebrew, because the people on the wall can hear you."
23:36:12:But the officer replied, "Has my master sent me to speak only to you and your master, and not to the people on the wall who are doomed to suffer the same fate as you?"
23:36:13:Then, speaking in Hebrew, he called out loudly, "Hear the message from the great king, the king of Assyria!
23:36:14:He says, 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you. He won't be able to save you from my power.
23:36:15:Don't let him convince you to trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city won't fall into the hands of the king of Assyria."'
23:36:16:Don't listen to Hezekiah! The king of Assyria commands you to make peace with him and surrender. Then each of you can eat from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own well.
23:36:17:He also promises to take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23:36:18:Don't let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, 'The LORD will rescue us.' Have any of the gods of other nations saved their lands from the power of the king of Assyria?
23:36:19:Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did they save Samaria from my hand?
23:36:20:Who among all the gods of these lands has rescued their people from me? How can the LORD save Jerusalem from my power?"
23:36:21:But the people remained silent and didn't say a word in response, for Hezekiah had commanded them, "Don't answer him."
23:36:22:Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they reported to him what the chief officer had said.
23:37:1:When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth. He went to the temple of the Lord.
23:37:2:He sent Eliakim, the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23:37:3:They told him, "Hezekiah says, 'This is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for our children are about to be born, but there's no strength to deliver them.'"
23:37:4:"Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and will rebuke him for the words that the Lord your God has heard. Lift up a prayer for the surviving people who are left.'"
23:37:5:So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
23:37:6:Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master this: 'The Lord says, "Don't be afraid because of the words you've heard, with which the attendants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
23:37:7:"I will put a spirit in him, so that he'll hear a rumor and return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'
23:37:8:The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
23:37:9:Now Sennacherib received a report concerning Tirhakah, the king of Cush, saying, "He has come out to fight against you." So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:
23:37:10:"Tell King Hezekiah of Judah, 'Don't let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'"
23:37:11:"You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them completely. Will you be delivered?"
23:37:12:"Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed rescue them? Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"
23:37:13:"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena and Ivvah?"
23:37:14:Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.
23:37:15:Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:
23:37:16:"Lord Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
23:37:17:"Pay attention, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see. Listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God."
23:37:18:"It's true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste to all these peoples and their lands."
23:37:19:"They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands."
23:37:20:"Now, Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord, are God."
23:37:21:Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,'"
23:37:22:"this is the word that the Lord has spoken against him: 'The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.'"
23:37:23:"Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!"
23:37:24:"Through your servants, you have taunted the Lord and said, 'With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its farthest heights, the finest of its forests.'"
23:37:25:"I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters;
23:37:26:"I have dried up with the soles of my feet all the streams of Egypt.'"
23:37:27:"But haven't you heard? I determined this long ago. From ancient times I planned it, and now I have brought it to pass. You were created to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble."
23:37:28:"Their inhabitants, powerless, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up."
23:37:29:"I know your every move, when you sit down and when you rise; I am aware of your comings and goings, and your raging against me."
23:37:30:"Because you have raged against me and your arrogance has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came."
23:37:31:"This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
23:37:32:"Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above."
23:37:33:"For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this."
23:37:34:"Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: 'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.'"
23:37:35:"By the way that he came, he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the Lord."
23:37:36:"I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."
23:37:37:Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!
23:37:38:So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
23:37:39:One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
23:38:1:In those days, Hezekiah became deathly ill. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came to him and said, "The Lord says you must get your affairs in order, for you will die soon; you will not recover."
23:38:2:Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
23:38:3:saying, "Please remember, O Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23:38:4:Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,
23:38:5:"Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: 'I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.
23:38:6:I will deliver you and this city from the hands of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.'"
23:38:7:Isaiah replied, "Take a lump of figs." So they took it and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
23:38:8:Hezekiah asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?"
23:38:9:Isaiah answered, "This will be the sign from the Lord that he will do what he has promised: Do you want the shadow to go forward ten steps or back ten steps?"
23:38:10:Hezekiah responded, "It's easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Instead, let it go back ten steps."
23:38:11:So Isaiah the prophet called on the Lord, and he made the shadow go back ten steps, as it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
23:38:12:When Hezekiah was recovering from his illness, he wrote this song of praise:
23:38:13:"I thought that in the prime of my life I would go to the gates of the grave, and be deprived of the remainder of my years.
23:38:14:I said, 'I will not see the Lord, the Lord in the land of the living; I will look on humanity no more among the inhabitants of the world.
23:38:15:My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; I have rolled up my life like a weaver. He cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23:38:16:I cried out until morning, like a lion he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.
23:38:17:Like a swallow or a crane, I chirp; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weary with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security."
23:38:18:But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I will walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
23:38:19:O Lord, by these things people live, and in all these is the life of my spirit; restore me to health and make me live!
23:38:20:Indeed, it was for my own welfare that I had great bitterness; but in love you have delivered my life from the pit of destruction, for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
23:38:21:For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot celebrate you; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
23:38:22:The living, the living, he thanks you, as I do this day; fathers make known to their children your faithfulness.
23:38:23:The Lord will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord."
23:39:1:At that time, Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered.
23:39:2:Hezekiah was pleased with the envoy and showed them his entire treasure house – the silver, gold, spices, and precious oil, as well as his armory and everything in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
23:39:3:Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant land, from Babylon."
23:39:4:Isaiah asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them all my treasures."
23:39:5:Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord Almighty:
23:39:6:'The days are coming when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says the Lord.
23:39:7:'And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away and made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
23:39:8:Hezekiah responded to Isaiah, "The word of the Lord you have spoken is good." For he thought, "At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime."
23:40:1:Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
23:40:2:Speak kindly to Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her time of hard service is over, her sins are forgiven, for she has received double punishment from the Lord's hand for all her iniquities.
23:40:3:A voice cries out, "Prepare the way for the Lord in the wilderness; make a straight path in the desert for our God."
23:40:4:Every valley will be lifted up, every mountain and hill made low; uneven ground will become level, and rough places a plain.
23:40:5:The glory of the Lord will be revealed, and everyone will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
23:40:6:A voice says, "Cry out!" And I said, "What should I cry?" All people are like grass, and their faithfulness like flowers of the field.
23:40:7:The grass withers, the flowers fade when the breath of the Lord blows on them; indeed, the people are like grass.
23:40:8:The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever.
23:40:9:Climb a high mountain, messenger of good news to Zion; raise your voice loudly, herald of good news to Jerusalem. Don't be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
23:40:10:Look, the Sovereign Lord comes with power, and his arm rules for him. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.
23:40:11:He tends his flock like a shepherd; he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
23:40:12:Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains on scales and the hills in a balance?
23:40:13:Who can fathom the Spirit of the Lord or instruct the Lord as his counselor?
23:40:14:Whom did he consult to gain understanding? Who taught him the path of justice, gave him knowledge, or showed him the way of wisdom?
23:40:15:Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are considered as dust on the scales. He lifts up the islands as though they were fine dust.
23:40:16:Lebanon is not enough for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
23:40:17:Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing.
23:40:18:To whom, then, will you compare God? What likeness will you use for him?
23:40:19:An idol? A craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
23:40:20:A person too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker to set up an idol that will not topple.
23:40:21:Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
23:40:22:He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
23:40:23:He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
23:40:24:No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
23:40:25:"To whom will you compare me? Who is my equal?" says the Holy One.
23:40:26:Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
23:40:27:Why do you complain, Jacob, and why do you say, Israel, "My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God"?
23:40:28:Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
23:40:29:He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
23:40:30:Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;
23:40:31:But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
23:41:1:Listen up, you islands, and pay attention, you distant nations. The LORD has called me from birth; from my mother's womb, He has mentioned my name.
23:41:2:He made my mouth like a sharp sword, hid me in the shadow of His hand, and shaped me like a polished arrow; He kept me in His quiver.
23:41:3:He said to me, "You are My servant, Israel, through whom I will show My glory."
23:41:4:But I thought, "I have labored in vain; I've spent my strength for nothing and achieved no purpose. Yet surely, my cause is with the LORD, and my reward is with my God."
23:41:5:Now the LORD, who formed me in the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him and gather Israel to Himself, says, "It is not enough for you to be My servant only to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make you a light for the nations, so that My salvation may reach the ends of the earth."
23:41:6:This is what the LORD, the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel, says to the one despised and abhorred by the nations, to the servant of rulers: "Kings will see you and rise up, princes will bow down, because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23:41:7:Thus says the LORD: "In a time of favor, I will answer you; on a day of salvation, I will help you. I will protect you and appoint you as a covenant for the people, to restore the land and allocate its desolate inheritances,
23:41:8:To say to the prisoners, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' They will feed along the paths, and find pasture on every barren hill.
23:41:9:They will neither hunger nor thirst; the scorching heat and sun will not strike them. For He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
23:41:10:So don't be afraid, for I am with you; don't be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand."
23:41:11:Look, all who rage against you will be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish.
23:41:12:Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be reduced to nothing.
23:41:13:For I am the LORD your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, "Do not fear, I will help you."
23:41:14:Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob, O little Israel, for I myself will help you," declares the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
23:41:15:See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
23:41:16:You will winnow them, the wind will carry them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them. But you will rejoice in the LORD and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
23:41:17:The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
23:41:18:I will open rivers on the barren heights, and fountains in the middle of the valleys. I will turn the desert into a pool of water, and the parched ground into springs.
23:41:19:I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and olive trees in the wilderness; I will set pines, cypress, and box trees together in the desert,
23:41:20:So that people may see and know, consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23:41:21:Present your case," says the LORD. "Bring forth your strong arguments," says the King of Jacob.
23:41:22:Let them come and tell us what will happen. Declare the former things, so we may consider them and know their outcome. Or announce to us what is coming.
23:41:23:Tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, good or bad, so we can be awestruck and fearful.
23:41:24:But you are less than nothing, and your works are utterly worthless; whoever chooses you is detestable.
23:41:25:I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes—one from the east who calls on My name. He tramples rulers as if they were mortar, like a potter treading clay.
23:41:26:Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, 'He was right'? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you.
23:41:27:I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news.
23:41:28:When I look, there is no one—no counselor among them, no one to give an answer when I ask them.
23:41:29:Behold, they are all false; their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.
23:42:1:Look, this is my servant whom I support, my chosen one in whom I take pleasure. I have placed my Spirit upon him; he will bring justice to the nations.
23:42:2:He won't shout or raise his voice; you won't hear him crying out in the streets.
23:42:3:A bruised reed he won't break, and a dimly burning wick he won't snuff out. He'll work to establish justice with truth.
23:42:4:He won't falter or be discouraged until he has established justice on earth; in his teachings, the islands will put their hope.
23:42:5:This is what God the LORD says—He who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and everything that comes from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it:
23:42:6:"I, the LORD, have called you for a righteous purpose; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and make you a covenant for the people and a light for the nations,
23:42:7:to open blind eyes, to free captives from prison, and to release those who sit in darkness from their dungeons.
23:42:8:I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols.
23:42:9:See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being, I announce them to you."
23:42:10:Sing to the LORD a new song, and praise Him from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live there.
23:42:11:Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops.
23:42:12:Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim His praise in the islands.
23:42:13:The LORD will march out like a champion, like a warrior He will stir up His zeal; with a shout, He will raise the battle cry and triumph over His enemies.
23:42:14:"For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant.
23:42:15:I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
23:42:16:I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them.
23:42:17:But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame.
23:42:18:Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!
23:42:19:Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one in covenant with me, blind like the servant of the LORD?
23:42:20:You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen."
23:42:21:It pleased the LORD, for the sake of His righteousness, to make His law great and glorious.
23:42:22:But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, "Send them back."
23:42:23:Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and pay attention for the time to come?
23:42:24:Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow His ways; they did not obey His law.
23:42:25:So He poured out on them His burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
23:43:1:Listen, Israel! The one who created you says, "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name; you are mine.
23:43:2:When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they won't overwhelm you. When you walk through fire, you won't be burned, and the flames won't consume you.
23:43:3:For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt as a ransom for you, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.
23:43:4:Because you are precious to me, and honored, I love you. I would give people in return for you and nations in exchange for your life.
23:43:5:So don't worry, for I am with you. I will bring your descendants from the east and gather you from the west.
23:43:6:I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
23:43:7:everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
23:43:8:Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind, and those who have ears but are deaf.
23:43:9:All the nations gather together, and the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this and show us the former things? Let them bring their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, "It is true."
23:43:10:"You are my witnesses," declares the Lord, "and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am the one. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be any after me.
23:43:11:I, yes I, am the Lord, and apart from me there is no savior.
23:43:12:I have revealed, saved, and proclaimed—not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses," declares the Lord, "that I am God.
23:43:13:From eternity to eternity I am God. No one can snatch anything out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?"
23:43:14:This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "For your sake, I will send an army against Babylon, bringing down all her strongholds and turning her into ruins.
23:43:15:I am the Lord, your Holy One, Israel's Creator and King.
23:43:16:Thus says the Lord, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters,
23:43:17:who brings forth the chariots and horses, the armies and warriors—they lie down, they cannot rise; they are extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
23:43:18:Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
23:43:19:See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.
23:43:20:The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
23:43:21:the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
23:43:22:But you have not called on me, Jacob; you have not wearied yourselves for me, Israel.
23:43:23:You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
23:43:24:You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
23:43:25:I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for my own sake and will not remember your sins.
23:43:26:Remind me; let us argue the matter together. State your case, so that you may be proved right.
23:43:27:Your first father sinned, and your mediators have rebelled against me.
23:43:28:So I will disgrace the dignitaries of your temple, and I will consign Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
23:44:1:Listen now, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have chosen.
23:44:2:This is what the LORD says, who made you and formed you from the womb, who will help you: Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, and Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
23:44:3:I will pour water on the thirsty ground, and streams upon the dry land; I will pour my Spirit upon your descendants, and my blessing upon your offspring.
23:44:4:They will spring up like grass among the waters, like willows by flowing streams.
23:44:5:One will say, 'I belong to the LORD'; another will call himself by the name of Jacob; still another will write on his hand, 'The LORD's,' and will take the name Israel.
23:44:6:The LORD, the King of Israel, their Redeemer, the LORD Almighty says: I am the first and I am the last; there is no God besides me.
23:44:7:Who is like me? Let them proclaim it; let them declare and set forth before me. Who has announced the ancient events? Let them foretell what is yet to come.
23:44:8:Do not tremble or be afraid; have I not told you and declared it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.
23:44:9:All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.
23:44:10:Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing?
23:44:11:Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, and the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble and take their stand; they will be terrified and humiliated together.
23:44:12:The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, forging it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry and weak, unable to drink water or eat food.
23:44:13:The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, with human beauty, to dwell in a shrine.
23:44:14:He cuts down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
23:44:15:It is used as fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
23:44:16:Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see the fire."
23:44:17:From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me! You are my god!"
23:44:18:They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
23:44:19:No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"
23:44:20:Such a person feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?"
23:44:21:Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel. I have formed you, you are my servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
23:44:22:I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
23:44:23:Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, O earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and displayed his glory in Israel.
23:44:24:This is what the LORD says—your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.
23:44:25:I frustrate the signs of false prophets and make fools of diviners; I turn wise men back and make their knowledge foolish.
23:44:26:I confirm the word of my servant and fulfill the predictions of my messengers. I say to Jerusalem, 'You shall be inhabited,' and to the cities of Judah, 'You shall be rebuilt, and I will restore your ruins.'
23:44:27:I say to the watery deep, 'Be dry, and I will dry up your streams.'
23:44:28:I say of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid."' 
23:45:1:This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, His chosen one, whom He has taken by the right hand, so he may subdue nations before him and strip kings of their power, opening doors ahead of him and ensuring no gates will be shut:
23:45:2:I will go before you and level the mountains. I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron.
23:45:3:I will give you hidden treasures and secret riches, so that you may know that I am the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by name.
23:45:4:For the sake of my servant Jacob and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name and give you a title of honor, even though you do not know me.
23:45:5:I am the Lord, and there is no other; there is no God besides me. I will strengthen you, even though you have not known me,
23:45:6:so that people from east to west may know that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other.
23:45:7:I form light and create darkness, I bring peace and cause disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things.
23:45:8:Let the skies above rain down righteousness, let the earth open up and produce salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up as well. I, the Lord, have created it.
23:45:9:Woe to anyone who argues with their Creator—like a pot among pots of clay! Does the clay say to the potter, "What are you making?" or "Your work has no handles"?
23:45:10:Woe to the one who says to their father, "What have you brought forth?" or to their mother, "What have you given birth to?"
23:45:11:This is what the Lord, the Holy One of Israel and its Creator, says: "Ask me about things to come concerning my children, and give me orders concerning the work of my hands.
23:45:12:I have made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshaled their starry hosts.
23:45:13:I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, not for a price or reward," says the Lord Almighty.
23:45:14:This is what the Lord says: "The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and those tall Sabeans, will come over to you and be yours; they will follow you, coming over in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, 'Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.'"
23:45:15:Truly, you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
23:45:16:All of them will be put to shame and disgraced; those who fashion idols will go away in humiliation.
23:45:17:But Israel will be saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.
23:45:18:For this is what the Lord says—He who created the heavens, He is God; He who fashioned and made the earth, He founded it; He did not create it to be empty but formed it to be inhabited—He says: "I am the Lord, and there is no other.
23:45:19:I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob's descendants, 'Seek me in vain.' I, the Lord, speak the truth; I declare what is right.
23:45:20:Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood, who pray to gods that cannot save.
23:45:21:Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me.
23:45:22:Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
23:45:23:By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear.
23:45:24:They will say of me, 'In the Lord alone are deliverance and strength.' All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame.
23:45:25:In the Lord, all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exult.
23:46:1:Babylon's idols, Bel and Nebo, are being carried away on the backs of beasts, a heavy burden for the weary animals.
23:46:2:These gods stoop and bow down, unable to save themselves from the weight. They too are taken captive, along with those who worship them.
23:46:3:Listen to me, you descendants of Jacob, all you who remain in Israel. I have carried you since your birth; I have taken care of you from the time you were born.
23:46:4:Even when you grow old and your hair turns gray, I will still be there, carrying and supporting you. I have made you, and I will continue to bear you up and deliver you.
23:46:5:To whom can you compare me or make me equal? Who is my match, says the Holy One?
23:46:6:Some people pour out gold from their bags and weigh silver on scales. They hire a goldsmith to make a god, and they bow down and worship it.
23:46:7:They lift it onto their shoulders and carry it around. But it cannot respond or save them from their troubles.
23:46:8:Remember this and stand firm, you rebels. Think about the past and what has happened.
23:46:9:I am God, and there is no other. I am God, and there is none like me.
23:46:10:I declare the end from the beginning, and ancient times from what is still to come. I say, "My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please."
23:46:11:I call a bird of prey from the east, a man for my purpose from a far-off land. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have planned it, and I will do it.
23:46:12:Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted people, far from righteousness.
23:46:13:I am bringing my righteousness near; it is not far away. My salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion and bring glory to Israel.
23:47:1:Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans! For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.
23:47:2:Take the millstones and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers.
23:47:3:Your nakedness will be exposed, and your shame will be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will not spare anyone.
23:47:4:Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.
23:47:5:Sit in silence and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.
23:47:6:I was angry with my people; I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand. You showed them no mercy; even on the elderly, you laid a heavy yoke.
23:47:7:You said, "I will be a queen forever." You did not consider these things or reflect on their outcome.
23:47:8:Now listen, you lover of pleasure, who sit securely, saying in your heart, "I am, and there is none besides me; I will never be a widow, nor suffer the loss of children."
23:47:9:But these two things will come upon you suddenly, in one day: widowhood and the loss of children. They will come upon you in full measure, despite your many sorceries and the potency of your spells.
23:47:10:You felt secure in your wickedness, saying, "No one sees me." Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray, and you told yourself, "I am, and there is none besides me."
23:47:11:Disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to ward it off. Devastation will fall upon you suddenly, without you realizing it.
23:47:12:Keep on with your enchantments and the multitude of your sorceries, which you have labored at since your youth. Perhaps you can succeed; perhaps you can inspire terror.
23:47:13:You are wearied by your many plans; let the astrologers, stargazers, and monthly prognosticators stand up and save you from what will come upon you.
23:47:14:Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. There will be no coals for warming oneself, nor a fire to sit before.
23:47:15:Thus shall your merchants be to you, those with whom you have traded from your youth; each has wandered in his own direction, and there is no one to save you.
23:48:1:Listen to this, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and come from the line of Judah, you who swear by the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel—but not in truth or righteousness.
23:48:2:For they call themselves after the holy city and rely on the God of Israel; the Lord Almighty is his name.
23:48:3:I have declared the former things long ago; they went forth from my mouth, and I announced them. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
23:48:4:Because I knew that you were obstinate, and your neck was an iron sinew and your forehead bronze,
23:48:5:Therefore, I told you these things before they happened; I announced them to you so that you could not say, 'My idol did them, my carved image and my molten image commanded them.'
23:48:6:You have heard; now see all this; will you not declare it? From now on I will show you new things, hidden things unknown to you.
23:48:7:They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say, 'Yes, I knew about them.'
23:48:8:You have neither heard nor understood; from long ago your ears have not been open. Well do I know how treacherous you are; you were called a rebel from birth.
23:48:9:For my own name's sake, I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise, I hold it back from you, so as not to destroy you completely.
23:48:10:See, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
23:48:11:For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.
23:48:12:Listen to me, O Jacob, Israel, whom I have called: I am he; I am the first and I am the last.
23:48:13:My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together.
23:48:14:Come together, all of you, and listen: Which of the idols has foretold these things? The Lord's chosen ally will carry out his purpose against Babylon; his arm will be against the Chaldeans.
23:48:15:I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I will bring him, and he will succeed in his mission.
23:48:16:Come near me and listen to this: From the beginning, I have not spoken in secret; from the time it happened, I was there." And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me, endowed with his Spirit.
23:48:17:This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.
23:48:18:If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your well-being like the waves of the sea.
23:48:19:Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me."
23:48:20:Leave Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, "The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob."
23:48:21:They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out.
23:48:22:"There is no peace," says the Lord, "for the wicked."
23:49:1:Listen to me, you islands; pay attention, you distant nations: The LORD called me before I was born; from my mother's womb, he spoke my name.
23:49:2:He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, and hid me in the shadow of his hand. He made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.
23:49:3:He said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, through whom I will display my glory."
23:49:4:But I thought, "I have labored in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity." Yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward is with my God.
23:49:5:Now the LORD, who formed me in the womb to be his servant, says to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself—for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has been my strength.
23:49:6:He says, "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant, to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth."
23:49:7:This is what the LORD, the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel, says to the one despised and abhorred by the nations, to the servant of rulers: "Kings will see and rise up, princes will bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23:49:8:In the time of favor, I will answer you; on the day of salvation, I will help you. I will protect you and make you a covenant for the people, to restore the land and distribute its desolate inheritances.
23:49:9:To the prisoners, I will say, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!' They will feed along the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.
23:49:10:They will neither hunger nor thirst; the scorching heat and sun will not strike them. For he who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
23:49:11:I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up.
23:49:12:See, they will come from afar—some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan."
23:49:13:Sing for joy, you heavens, and rejoice, you earth; break forth into song, you mountains! For the LORD comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
23:49:14:But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me."
23:49:15:"Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? Even if these may forget, I will not forget you!
23:49:16:Look, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me.
23:49:17:Your children hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you.
23:49:18:Lift up your eyes and look around; all your children gather and come to you. As surely as I live," declares the LORD, "you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride."
23:49:19:Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away.
23:49:20:The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.'
23:49:21:Then you will say in your heart, 'Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these—where have they come from?'"
23:49:22:This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I will beckon to the nations, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
23:49:23:Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed."
23:49:24:Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives be rescued from the fierce?
23:49:25:But this is what the LORD says: "Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save.
23:49:26:I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
23:50:1:This is what the Lord says: "Where is your mother's divorce certificate, with which I sent her away? Or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Look, it's because of your sins that you were sold, and because of your transgressions that your mother was sent away.
23:50:2:When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why did nobody answer? Is my hand too short to redeem, or do I lack the power to deliver? Behold, with my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.
23:50:3:I dress the heavens in black and cover them with sackcloth."
23:50:4:The Sovereign Lord has given me an educated tongue, so I can know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens me morning by morning, awakens my ear to listen like one being instructed.
23:50:5:The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away.
23:50:6:I offered my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.
23:50:7:Because the Lord God helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore, I have set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.
23:50:8:He who vindicates me is near. Who will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me!
23:50:9:Surely the Lord God will help me; who is there to condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment; the moths will eat them up.
23:50:10:Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let the one who walks in the dark, without a light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on their God.
23:50:11:But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you'll receive from my hand: you will lie down in torment.
23:51:1:Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and seek the Lord: Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were dug.
23:51:2:Consider your ancestor Abraham and Sarah, who gave birth to you: I called him alone, and blessed him, and made his descendants numerous.
23:51:3:Indeed, the Lord will comfort Zion; He will bring comfort to all her ruins. He will transform her wilderness into a paradise, and her desert into the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her, along with thanksgiving and melodious songs.
23:51:4:Pay attention to me, my people; give ear to me, my nation, for a law will go forth from me, and I will establish my justice as a light for the peoples.
23:51:5:My righteousness is near, my salvation has gone forth, and my arms will judge the nations. The coastlands will wait for me, and they will trust in my powerful arm.
23:51:6:Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth below; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its inhabitants will die like gnats. But my salvation will last forever, and my righteousness will never be broken.
23:51:7:Listen to me, you who know what is right, you people with my law in your hearts: Do not fear the reproach of others, nor be terrified by their insults.
23:51:8:For the moth will eat them like a garment, and the worm will devour them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever, and my salvation for all generations.
23:51:9:Awake, awake, arm of the Lord! Put on strength as in the days of old, as in the generations of long ago. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces and pierced the dragon?
23:51:10:Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, making a road in the depths of the sea for the redeemed to pass over?
23:51:11:Those ransomed by the Lord will return and enter Zion with singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Gladness and joy will overtake them, while sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23:51:12:I, even I, am the one who comforts you. Who are you that you should fear mortal humans, who are destined to die, and forget the Lord your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth?
23:51:13:You constantly fear the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy. But where is the fury of the oppressor now?
23:51:14:The captive exile will soon be set free; they will not die in the pit, nor will they lack bread.
23:51:15:For I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar— the Lord of Hosts is my name.
23:51:16:I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand, to establish the heavens, lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, 'You are my people.'
23:51:17:Wake up, wake up! Stand up, Jerusalem! You have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath, the chalice of staggering that made you reel.
23:51:18:There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne; there is no one to take her by the hand among all the children she has raised.
23:51:19:These two things have befallen you— who will mourn for you?— devastation and destruction, famine and sword; how can I comfort you?
23:51:20:Your children have fainted; they lie at the head of every street, like an antelope caught in a net. They are full of the wrath of the Lord, the rebuke of your God.
23:51:21:So now hear this, you afflicted one, drunk but not with wine.
23:51:22:This is what your Sovereign Lord says, your God who defends his people: "See, I have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger; from that cup, the goblet of my wrath, you will never drink again.
23:51:23:I will put it into the hands of your tormentors, who said to you, 'Bow down, so we can walk on you.' And you made your back like the ground, like a street for them to walk on."
23:52:1:Awaken, awaken, O Zion! Put on your strength and beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city. For no longer will the uncircumcised or unclean enter you.
23:52:2:Shake off the dust and rise up, captive Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
23:52:3:For this is what the Lord says: "You were sold for nothing, and without money you shall be redeemed."
23:52:4:For thus says the Lord God: "My people went down to Egypt long ago as foreigners to live there; later, the Assyrians oppressed them for no reason.
23:52:5:Now, what do I gain here?" declares the Lord. "For my people are taken away for nothing. Those who rule over them mock," says the Lord, "and my name is continually blasphemed all day long.
23:52:6:Therefore, my people shall know my name; in that day, they will understand that it is I who speaks: 'Here I am.'"
23:52:7:How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger bringing good news, proclaiming peace, sharing tidings of happiness, announcing salvation, and saying to Zion, "Your God reigns!"
23:52:8:Listen! Your watchmen lift their voices; together they shout for joy. When the Lord returns to Zion, they will see it with their own eyes.
23:52:9:Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23:52:10:The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will witness the salvation of our God.
23:52:11:Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the vessels of the Lord.
23:52:12:But you will not leave in haste or flee in panic; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23:52:13:See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
23:52:14:Just as many were appalled at him—his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness—
23:52:15:So he will sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.
23:53:1:Who would have believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
23:53:2:He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
23:53:3:He was despised and rejected by others, a man of suffering, acquainted with grief. Like one from whom people hide their faces, he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
23:53:4:Surely he took on our pain and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.
23:53:5:But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds, we are healed.
23:53:6:We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
23:53:7:He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
23:53:8:By oppression and judgment he was taken away, and who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
23:53:9:He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
23:53:10:Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
23:53:11:After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.
23:53:12:Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
23:54:1:Sing out, you childless woman who never bore a child! Shout for joy and sing, you who never experienced childbirth! For the children of the desolate woman will be more numerous than the children of her who is married, says the Lord.
23:54:2:Enlarge your living space and stretch out your tent's curtains. Don't hold back; lengthen your ropes and strengthen your stakes.
23:54:3:For you will spread out to the right and to the left. Your descendants will possess the nations and inhabit the desolate cities.
23:54:4:Don't be afraid, for you won't be put to shame. Don't feel humiliated, for you won't be disgraced. You'll forget the shame of your youth and won't remember the disgrace of your widowhood anymore.
23:54:5:Your Maker is your husband; the Lord Almighty is his name. The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, and he is called the God of all the earth.
23:54:6:The Lord will call you back, like a wife deserted and brokenhearted. A wife rejected in her youth, says your God.
23:54:7:I abandoned you for a brief moment, but with great compassion, I will gather you back.
23:54:8:In a surge of anger, I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness, I will have mercy on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer.
23:54:9:This is like the days of Noah to me. As I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth, so now I swear not to be angry with you or rebuke you.
23:54:10:Though the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, my steadfast love will not depart from you, and my covenant of peace will not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
23:54:11:You afflicted one, tossed by storms and not comforted, I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise, lay your foundations with sapphires.
23:54:12:I'll make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
23:54:13:All your children will be taught by the Lord, and great will be their peace.
23:54:14:In righteousness, you will be established. You will be far from oppression, for you won't fear it, and from terror, for it won't come near you.
23:54:15:If anyone attacks you, it won't be my doing; whoever attacks you will fall because of you.
23:54:16:Look, I've created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And I've created the destroyer to wreak havoc.
23:54:17:No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me, declares the Lord.
23:55:1:Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without cost!
23:55:2:Why spend your money on what isn't food, and your hard-earned wages on what doesn't satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and you will eat well, enjoying the finest of foods.
23:55:3:Pay attention and come to me; listen, so that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, giving you the faithful love I promised to David.
23:55:4:Look, I have made him a witness to the people, a leader and commander for the nations.
23:55:5:You will summon nations you do not know, and they will come running to you because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has honored you.
23:55:6:Seek the Lord while he can be found; call on him while he is near.
23:55:7:Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them return to the Lord, and he will show them mercy; to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
23:55:8:For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
23:55:9:As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23:55:10:Just as rain and snow fall from the sky and do not return without watering the earth, making it bud and flourish, providing seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
23:55:11:So is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
23:55:12:You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
23:55:13:Instead of the thornbush, a cypress tree will grow, and instead of the brier, a myrtle will spring up. This will stand as a testimony to the Lord's name, an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed.
23:56:1:This is what the Lord says: "Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand, and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
23:56:2:Blessed is the one who does this, the person who holds fast to it, observing the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeping their hand from doing any evil."
23:56:3:Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say, "The Lord will surely exclude me from his people." And let not the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
23:56:4:For this is what the Lord says: "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, choose what pleases me, and hold fast to my covenant,
23:56:5:I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
23:56:6:And to the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, and holds fast to my covenant,
23:56:7:I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
23:56:8:The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares, "I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered."
23:56:9:All you beasts of the field, come to devour, all you beasts in the forest.
23:56:10:Israel's watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep.
23:56:11:These dogs have fierce appetites; they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, each seeks his own gain.
23:56:12:"Come," each one cries, "let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better."
23:57:1:Good people pass away; the righteous often die before their time. But no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to understand that God is protecting them from the evil to come.
23:57:2:For those who follow the right path will find peace and rest in death, as they lie down to sleep.
23:57:3:But you, children of a sorceress, offspring of adulterers and prostitutes, come closer!
23:57:4:Who do you mock? Who do you sneer at and stick out your tongue? Aren't you rebellious children and a dishonest race?
23:57:5:You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.
23:57:6:The smooth stones of the valley are your portion; yes, they are your lot; you have even poured out a drink offering to them, you have made a grain offering. Shall I relent concerning these things?
23:57:7:Upon a high and lofty mountain, you have set up your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifices.
23:57:8:Behind the doors and the doorposts, you have set up your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, climbed into it, and opened it wide; you made a deal with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.
23:57:9:You went to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far off and degraded yourself even to Sheol.
23:57:10:You were wearied by the length of your way, but you did not say, 'It is hopeless.' You found new life for your strength, and so you were not weak.
23:57:11:Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me, and have neither remembered me nor taken this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?
23:57:12:I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.
23:57:13:When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry them all off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.
23:57:14:And it shall be said, "Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstacle out of the way of my people."
23:57:15:For this is what the high and exalted One says—He who lives forever, whose name is holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23:57:16:I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry, for then their spirits would grow weak before me—the very people I have made.
23:57:17:I was angry because of their sinful greed; I punished them and hid my face in anger, yet they kept on in their willful ways.
23:57:18:I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel's mourners,
23:57:19:creating praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near," says the Lord. "And I will heal them."
23:57:20:But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.
23:57:21:"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
23:58:1:Shout loudly, don't hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet. Tell my people about their rebellion and the descendants of Jacob about their sins.
23:58:2:Indeed, they seek me daily and delight in knowing my ways, as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not abandon the justice of their God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager to draw near to God.
23:58:3:They say, "Why have we fasted, but you haven't seen? Why have we humbled ourselves, but you haven't noticed?" Look, on your fasting days you pursue your own interests and exploit your workers.
23:58:4:Your fasting leads to strife and conflict, and striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.
23:58:5:Is this the kind of fast I choose, a day for people to humble themselves? Is it merely bowing one's head like a reed and lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord?
23:58:6:No, this is the kind of fast I desire: to break the chains of wickedness, to untie the ropes of oppression, to set free the oppressed, and to tear off every yoke.
23:58:7:It is to share your food with the hungry, to provide shelter for the homeless, to clothe the naked, and not to turn away from your own relatives.
23:58:8:Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
23:58:9:When you call out, the Lord will answer; when you cry for help, he will say, "Here I am." If you remove the yoke of oppression, stop pointing fingers, and speaking maliciously,
23:58:10:and if you offer food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like noonday.
23:58:11:The Lord will guide you continually, satisfying your needs in parched places and strengthening your bones. You will be like a well-watered garden, a spring whose waters never fail.
23:58:12:Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will raise up the age-old foundations. You will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
23:58:13:If you keep the Sabbath by not doing as you please on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord's holy day honorable, and honor it by not going your own way or seeking your own pleasure or talking idly,
23:58:14:then you will find joy in the Lord, and I will make you ride on the heights of the land and feed you with the heritage of Jacob, your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
23:59:1: Look, the Lord's hand isn't too short to save, nor is his ear too dull to hear.
23:59:2: But your wrongdoings have created a barrier between you and your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so he doesn't listen.
23:59:3: Your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wickedness.
23:59:4: No one calls for justice, nor does anyone plead honestly; they rely on empty arguments, they tell lies, and conceive trouble.
23:59:5: They hatch snake eggs and weave spider webs; whoever eats their eggs dies, and if one is crushed, a viper hatches.
23:59:6: Their webs can't be used as clothing, nor can they cover themselves with their works; their deeds are evil, and violence is in their hands.
23:59:7: Their feet rush into sin, and they're quick to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are full of wickedness, destruction and misery mark their paths.
23:59:8: They don't know the way of peace, and there's no fairness in their tracks; they've made crooked paths for themselves, and whoever walks in them won't know peace.
23:59:9: That's why justice is far from us, and righteousness doesn't reach us; we hope for light, but find darkness, and for brightness, but walk in gloom.
23:59:10: We grope like the blind along a wall, feeling our way like people without eyes; we stumble at noon as if it were twilight, among the strong as if we were dead.
23:59:11: We all growl like bears and moan like doves; we look for justice, but there's none, and for salvation, but it's far from us.
23:59:12: Our rebellions are many in your presence, and our sins testify against us; our wrongdoings are with us, and we know our iniquities.
23:59:13: We've rebelled and denied the Lord, turned away from following our God; we've spoken of oppression and revolt, and conceived lies in our hearts.
23:59:14: Justice is pushed back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth stumbles in the streets, and honesty can't enter.
23:59:15: Truth is missing, and whoever turns from evil becomes a target; the Lord sees this, and he's displeased that there's no justice.
23:59:16: He's appalled that there's no one to intervene, so his own arm brings him victory, and his righteousness supports him.
23:59:17: He puts on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he wears garments of vengeance and wraps himself in zeal like a cloak.
23:59:18: According to their deeds, he will repay wrath to his adversaries and retribution to his enemies; he'll repay the coastlands what they deserve.
23:59:19: From the west, people will fear the Lord's name, and from the rising of the sun, his glory; for he'll come like a rushing stream driven by the wind of the Lord.
23:59:20: A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, declares the Lord.
23:59:21: As for me, this is my covenant with them, says the Lord: My Spirit that's upon you, and my words that I've put in your mouth, won't depart from your mouth or the mouths of your descendants, or their children's mouths, from now on and forever, says the Lord.
23:60:1:Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.
23:60:2:Look around, darkness covers the earth and thick gloom engulfs the peoples; but the Lord will shine upon you, and His glory will be seen over you.
23:60:3:Nations will approach your light, and kings will be drawn to the brightness of your dawn.
23:60:4:Lift up your eyes and look around; they all gather and come to you—your sons from far away, and your daughters carried on the hip.
23:60:5:Then you will see and be radiant, your heart will tremble and swell with joy; for the wealth of the seas will be brought to you, and the riches of nations will come to you.
23:60:6:Multitudes of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba will come, bringing gold and incense, and proclaiming the praises of the Lord.
23:60:7:All Kedar's flocks will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you; they will be accepted as offerings on My altar, and I will adorn My glorious temple.
23:60:8:Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like doves to their nests?
23:60:9:Surely the islands will wait for Me, with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your children from afar, along with their silver and gold, in honor of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you.
23:60:10:Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. In My wrath, I struck you, but in My favor, I have shown you mercy.
23:60:11:Your gates will always stand open, day and night they will never be shut, so that people may bring you the wealth of nations—their kings led in procession.
23:60:12:For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; such nations will be utterly ruined.
23:60:13:The glory of Lebanon will come to you—its cypress, pine, and boxwood together—to beautify the place of My sanctuary, and I will honor the place where My feet rest.
23:60:14:The sons of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23:60:15:Although you were once forsaken and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, a joy from generation to generation.
23:60:16:You will drink the milk of nations and nurse at royal breasts. Then you will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23:60:17:Instead of bronze, I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron. Instead of wood, I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones. I will make peace your governor and righteousness your ruler.
23:60:18:No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.
23:60:19:The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23:60:20:Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.
23:60:21:Then all your people will be righteous and they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot I have planted, the work of My hands, for the display of My splendor.
23:60:22:The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the Lord; in its time, I will accomplish it quickly.
23:61:1:The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because he has chosen me to bring good news to the poor. He sent me to comfort those who are brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty for the captives, and freedom for those in prison.
23:61:2:I am here to announce the year of the Lord's favor and the day of our God's vengeance; to comfort all who mourn,
23:61:3:and provide for those who grieve in Zion. I will give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.
23:61:4:They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
23:61:5:Strangers will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
23:61:6:You will be called priests of the Lord, ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast.
23:61:7:Instead of shame and dishonor, you will receive a double portion, and instead of humiliation, you will rejoice in your inheritance. And so you will inherit a double portion in your land, and everlasting joy will be yours.
23:61:8:For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness, I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them.
23:61:9:Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed.
23:61:10:I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23:61:11:For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
23:62:1:For the sake of Zion, I won't stay silent; for Jerusalem's sake, I won't rest until her righteousness shines like the dawn and her salvation blazes like a burning torch.
23:62:2:Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings will witness your glory. You'll be given a new name, which the Lord himself will determine.
23:62:3:You'll be like a beautiful crown in the Lord's hand, a royal diadem held by your God.
23:62:4:No longer will they call you "Forsaken" or your land "Desolate." Instead, you'll be called "My Delight Is in Her," and your land "Married," for the Lord delights in you, and your land will be united with him.
23:62:5:As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.
23:62:6:I have stationed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, don't give yourselves any rest,
23:62:7:and don't let him rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it an object of praise throughout the earth.
23:62:8:The Lord has sworn by his right hand and mighty arm: "I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies, nor will foreigners drink the new wine for which you've toiled.
23:62:9:But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."
23:62:10:Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way for the people! Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones! Raise a banner for the nations to see!
23:62:11:Indeed, the Lord has proclaimed to the ends of the earth: "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Look, your Savior is coming! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'"
23:62:12:They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Forsaken.
23:63:1:Who is this coming from Edom, with his garments stained red from Bozrah? This one who is splendid in his apparel, marching confidently in his great power? "It is I, the one who speaks in righteousness, mighty to save."
23:63:2:Why are your clothes red, and your garments like those of someone who has trodden the winepress?
23:63:3:"I have trampled the winepress alone; from the nations, no one was with me. I trod them in my anger and crushed them in my wrath; their blood splattered on my garments, and I stained all my clothing.
23:63:4:For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption had come.
23:63:5:I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled that no one gave support. So, my own arm brought salvation for me, and my own wrath upheld me.
23:63:6:I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath, I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground."
23:63:7:I will tell of the Lord's unfailing love; I will praise the Lord for all he has done, for he has shown great kindness to the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many mercies.
23:63:8:He said, "Surely they are my people, children who will be true to me"; and so he became their Savior.
23:63:9:In all their distress, he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy, he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23:63:10:Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So, he turned and became their enemy, and he himself fought against them.
23:63:11:Then his people remembered the days of old, the time of Moses and his people. They asked, "Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is the one who put his Holy Spirit among them,
23:63:12:who displayed his power through Moses' right hand, dividing the waters before them to gain for himself everlasting renown,
23:63:13:who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;
23:63:14:like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the Lord. This is how you guided your people, to make for yourself a glorious name."
23:63:15:Look down from heaven and see, from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.
23:63:16:But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
23:63:17:Why, Lord, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.
23:63:18:For a little while, your holy people possessed your sanctuary, but now our enemies have trampled it down.
23:63:19:We are like those you have never ruled, like those never called by your name.
23:64:1:Oh, if only you would tear open the heavens and come down! Your presence would make the mountains tremble.
23:64:2:As fire kindles brushwood and makes water boil, your appearance would cause your enemies to know your name and the nations to tremble before you.
23:64:3:When you did amazing things we didn't expect, you came down and the mountains shook at your presence.
23:64:4:From ancient times, no one has heard or perceived by the ear, nor has any eye seen a God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
23:64:5:You meet those who joyfully do what is right, remembering your ways. But we've sinned, and in our sins, we've been a long time; can we still be saved?
23:64:6:We've all become like someone unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like filthy rags. We all wither like leaves, and our sins sweep us away like the wind.
23:64:7:No one calls on your name or strives to take hold of you, for you've hidden your face from us and given us over to our sins.
23:64:8:Yet, Lord, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23:64:9:Don't be too angry, Lord, and don't remember our sins forever. Look upon us, for we are all your people.
23:64:10:Your sacred cities have become a wilderness, Zion has turned into a wasteland, and Jerusalem lies desolate.
23:64:11:Our holy and beautiful temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
23:64:12:After all this, Lord, will you still hold back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
23:65:1:I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me; I made myself known to those who did not ask for me.
23:65:2:All day long, I stretched out my hands to a rebellious people, who walk in ways that are not good, following their own thoughts.
23:65:3:These people continually provoke me to anger right before my face, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick.
23:65:4:They sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; they eat the flesh of pigs and use polluted broth in their cooking pots.
23:65:5:Claiming to be holier than others, they say, "Keep away; don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you!" Such people are like smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.
23:65:6:Look, it is written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will repay them into their laps
23:65:7:both for their sins and the sins of their ancestors, says the LORD. For they have burned incense on the mountains and scorned me on the hills, so I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.
23:65:8:This is what the LORD says: As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and people say, "Don't destroy it, there is still a blessing in it," so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.
23:65:9:I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and heirs to my mountains from Judah; my chosen ones will inherit it, and my servants will dwell there.
23:65:10:Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.
23:65:11:But as for you who forsake the LORD and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
23:65:12:I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; for when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.
23:65:13:Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
23:65:14:My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
23:65:15:You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.
23:65:16:Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
23:65:17:Look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
23:65:18:But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
23:65:19:I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
23:65:20:Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
23:65:21:They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23:65:22:No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.
23:65:23:They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they are the offspring of those blessed by the LORD, and their descendants with them.
23:65:24:Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
23:65:25:The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD.
23:66:1:This is what the LORD says: "Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool. Where could you build a house for me? And where would be my resting place?
23:66:2:For everything has been made by my hand, and all things belong to me," declares the LORD. "But I will look favorably on those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word.
23:66:3:Those who kill an ox as if they were slaying a person, those who sacrifice a lamb as if they were breaking a dog's neck, those who present grain offerings as if they were offering pig's blood, and those who burn incense as if they were praising idols—these have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their detestable practices.
23:66:4:So I too will choose harsh treatment for them and bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me."
23:66:5:Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your own people who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!' But they will be put to shame.
23:66:6:Listen! A noise from the city, a voice from the temple—the voice of the LORD, repaying his enemies all they deserve.
23:66:7:Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.
23:66:8:Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
23:66:9:Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?" says your God.
23:66:10:Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.
23:66:11:So that you may nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.
23:66:12:For this is what the LORD says: "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
23:66:13:As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem."
23:66:14:When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
23:66:15:See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
23:66:16:For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the LORD.
23:66:17:Those who consecrate and purify themselves to enter the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats, and other unclean things—they will meet their end together," declares the LORD.
23:66:18:"And I, because of their actions and their thoughts, am coming to gather all nations and tongues; they will come and see my glory.
23:66:19:I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
23:66:20:They will bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels—to my holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "just as the Israelites bring their grain offerings in ceremonially clean vessels to the house of the LORD.
23:66:21:And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites," says the LORD.
23:66:22:"As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your name and descendants endure.
23:66:23:From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the LORD.
23:66:24:"And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
