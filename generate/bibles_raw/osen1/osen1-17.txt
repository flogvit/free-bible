17:1:1:In the days of King Ahasuerus, who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia,
17:1:2:During the time when he reigned from his royal throne in the capital city of Susa,
17:1:3:In the third year of his reign, he held a grand feast for all his officials and servants. The army leaders of Persia and Media, as well as the nobles and governors of the provinces, were present.
17:1:4:For six months, the king showcased the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor of his majesty.
17:1:5:When these days were over, the king held another feast lasting seven days in the enclosed garden of the royal palace for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were in the city of Susa.
17:1:6:The garden was adorned with white and blue linen curtains, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings on marble pillars. There were gold and silver couches on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
17:1:7:Drinks were served in golden goblets, each one unique, and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king's generosity.
17:1:8:Everyone could drink as much as they wanted, for the king had instructed all the wine stewards to serve each guest according to their own desires.
17:1:9:Queen Vashti also held a feast for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.
17:1:10:On the seventh day, when the king was in high spirits from the wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who attended him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas—
17:1:11:To bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, to display her beauty to the people and officials, for she was lovely to look at.
17:1:12:But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command, which angered the king greatly.
17:1:13:So the king consulted the wise men who understood the times, for it was customary to confer with those who knew law and justice.
17:1:14:The closest advisors to the king were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven nobles of Persia and Media who had access to the king and held the highest positions in the kingdom.
17:1:15:"What should be done," the king asked, "according to the law, to Queen Vashti for disobeying the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs?"
17:1:16:Memucan replied in the presence of the king and his officials, "Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king but also all the officials and the peoples in every province of King Ahasuerus.
17:1:17:For the queen's actions will become known to all women, causing them to look down on their husbands, saying, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.'
17:1:18:Today, the noblewomen of Persia and Media who hear about the queen's actions will speak in the same way to all the king's officials, leading to much contempt and anger.
17:1:19:If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be issued by him, stating that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to someone else who is more worthy.
17:1:20:When this edict is proclaimed throughout the king's vast realm, all women will respect their husbands, from the greatest to the least."
17:1:21:The king and his officials approved this proposal, and the king did as Memucan suggested.
17:1:22:He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be the ruler of his own household and speak the language of his own people. FINISHED
17:2:1:After these events, when King Ahasuerus' anger had cooled down, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, as well as the decree he had made against her.
17:2:2:The king's servants suggested, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.
17:2:3:Appoint officers in every province of your kingdom to gather all the attractive young women into the palace at Susa, the capital. Place them under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch who oversees the women, and provide them with beauty treatments.
17:2:4:Then let the young woman who pleases the king become queen instead of Vashti." The king liked this idea, so he agreed to it.
17:2:5:There was a Jewish man living in the fortress of Susa named Mordecai, son of Jair, from the tribe of Benjamin. He was a descendant of Kish and Shimei.
17:2:6:Mordecai had been taken captive from Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, along with other exiles, including King Jeconiah of Judah.
17:2:7:Mordecai had raised his cousin Hadassah, also known as Esther, since she was an orphan. She was a beautiful young woman with a lovely figure, and Mordecai treated her like his own daughter.
17:2:8:When the king's order was announced, many young women were brought to the palace at Susa and placed under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the palace and entrusted to Hegai, who was responsible for the women.
17:2:9:Esther found favor with Hegai, and he quickly provided her with beauty treatments and special food. He also assigned seven maids to her from the palace and moved her and her maids to the best place in the women's quarters.
17:2:10:Esther did not reveal her nationality or family background, because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.
17:2:11:Every day, Mordecai would walk near the courtyard of the women's quarters to check on Esther and find out how she was doing.
17:2:12:Before meeting the king, each young woman had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for women—six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics.
17:2:13:When it was time for a young woman to go to the king, she could request anything she wanted to take with her from the women's quarters to the king's palace.
17:2:14:In the evening, she would go to the king, and in the morning, she would return to another part of the harem, under the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who looked after the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
17:2:15:When it was Esther's turn to go to the king, she asked for only what Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the women, suggested. Everyone who saw Esther admired her.
17:2:16:Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, during the seventh year of his reign.
17:2:17:The king loved Esther more than any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So, he placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17:2:18:King Ahasuerus held a great banquet for all his officials and servants to celebrate Esther's coronation. He also declared a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts generously.
17:2:19:When the virgins were gathered together for a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
17:2:20:Esther still had not revealed her family background or nationality, as Mordecai had instructed her. She continued to follow Mordecai's guidance, just as she had done when he was raising her.
17:2:21:During that time, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance, became angry and plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17:2:22:Mordecai discovered their plan and informed Queen Esther, who then reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.
17:2:23:When the matter was investigated and found to be true, the two conspirators were hanged on a gallows. The event was recorded in the presence of the king in the book of the chronicles.
17:3:1:In the reign of King Ahasuerus, a man named Haman rose to power. He was an Agagite and held a high position in the kingdom.
17:3:2:Haman was promoted by the king above all other officials and nobles, so everyone at the royal court was required to bow down and pay respect to him.
17:3:3:However, Mordecai, a Jew, refused to bow or show reverence to Haman, as it went against his beliefs.
17:3:4:When the other officials noticed Mordecai's defiance, they questioned him about it and wondered if he would be able to get away with not honoring Haman.
17:3:5:As time passed and Mordecai remained steadfast in his refusal, the officials decided to inform Haman of this situation to see how he would react.
17:3:6:Haman became furious when he found out that Mordecai was not bowing to him, and his anger grew even more when he learned that Mordecai was a Jew.
17:3:7:In the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus' reign, Haman plotted to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire kingdom, choosing a specific day by casting lots (known as Pur).
17:3:8:Then, Haman approached the king and said, "There is a certain group of people scattered among the provinces who have different laws and customs. They do not obey the king's laws, and it is not in your best interest to tolerate them."
17:3:9:"If it pleases the king," Haman continued, "let a decree be issued to destroy these people, and I will provide ten thousand talents of silver to the royal treasury for the expenses."
17:3:10:The king agreed with Haman's plan and handed him his signet ring, saying, "Keep the silver and do with these people as you please."
17:3:11:So, Haman summoned the king's scribes and ordered them to write a decree in every language of the kingdom, instructing governors and officials to destroy all Jews on the chosen day.
17:3:12:The decree was sent by couriers to every province, announcing that all Jews, young and old, women and children, were to be killed and their possessions plundered on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month.
17:3:13:As the news spread throughout the kingdom, the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.
17:3:14:Meanwhile, the king and Haman sat down to drink, seemingly unconcerned about the fate of the Jews.
17:4:1:When Mordecai learned about everything that had happened, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
17:4:2:He stopped at the king's gate, because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
17:4:3:In every province where the king's order and edict reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
17:4:4:Esther's maids and eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai's distress. The queen was deeply troubled, so she sent clothes for him to put on instead of the sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
17:4:5:Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
17:4:6:Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square near the king's gate.
17:4:7:Mordecai told him about all that had happened, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
17:4:8:He also gave Hathach a copy of the edict issued in Susa for their annihilation, so that he could show it to Esther and explain it to her. He instructed her to go to the king, beg for mercy, and plead for her people.
17:4:9:Hathach returned and relayed Mordecai's words to Esther.
17:4:10:Esther responded to Mordecai through Hathach, saying, "All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that if any man or woman approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned, there is only one law: they must be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. And I have not been summoned to come before the king for thirty days."
17:4:11:Hathach delivered Esther's message to Mordecai.
17:4:12:Mordecai sent this reply back to Esther: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
17:4:13:For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?"
17:4:14:Esther sent her response to Mordecai, saying, "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as well. Then I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish."
17:4:15:So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.
17:5:1:On the third day, Esther dressed in her royal attire and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace, facing the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the hall, facing the entrance.
17:5:2:When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she found favor in his sight, and he extended the golden scepter in his hand towards her. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
17:5:3:Then the king asked her, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even if it's up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted."
17:5:4:Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, I would like you and Haman to come today to a banquet I have prepared for you."
17:5:5:The king ordered, "Bring Haman quickly so that we may fulfill Esther's wish." So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17:5:6:While they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther again, "What is your petition? It will be granted. And what is your request? Even if it's up to half of the kingdom, it will be fulfilled."
17:5:7:Esther answered, "My petition and my request is this:
17:5:8:If I have found favor in the king's eyes, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to another banquet I will prepare for them tomorrow. Then I will answer the king's question."
17:5:9:Haman left that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate not standing or trembling before him, he became filled with rage toward Mordecai.
17:5:10:However, Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and his wife Zeresh.
17:5:11:He told them about his great wealth, the many sons he had, and how the king had promoted him above all the other officials and servants.
17:5:12:Haman added, "Even Queen Esther invited no one but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared. And she has invited me again tomorrow along with the king.
17:5:13:Yet all this means nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17:5:14:His wife Zeresh and all his friends advised him, "Have a gallows seventy-five feet high built, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then you can go joyfully with the king to the banquet." The suggestion pleased Haman, and he ordered the gallows to be built.
17:6:1:During that night, the king couldn't sleep. He decided to have some records read to him to pass the time.
17:6:2:As they read, they came across the story of Mordecai exposing the plot of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who had planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17:6:3:The king asked, "What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" The servants replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
17:6:4:Just then, Haman entered the outer court to speak with the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared. The king inquired, "Who is in the court?" 
17:6:5:The king's servants answered, "Haman is standing in the court." The king said, "Let him come in."
17:6:6:When Haman arrived, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?" Thinking the king meant to honor him, Haman said to himself.
17:6:7:Haman replied, "For the man the king wishes to honor, have royal robes brought which the king has worn, and a horse the king has ridden, with a royal crest placed on its head.
17:6:8:Then let one of the king's most noble officials dress the man in the royal robes and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king desires to honor!'"
17:6:9:The king responded, "Hurry! Take the robes and the horse as you've suggested, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not leave out anything you've mentioned."
17:6:10:Haman took the robes and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and led him through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king desires to honor!"
17:6:11:Afterward, Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning with his head covered.
17:6:12:Haman recounted to his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. They said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish descent, you won't be able to stand against him. You will surely fall before him."
17:6:13:While they were still talking, the king's eunuchs arrived and quickly brought Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17:7:1:So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther.
17:7:2:During the feast, on the second day, the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what is your request? I'll grant it to you, even up to half of my kingdom."
17:7:3:Esther replied, "If I have found favor in your eyes, O King, and if it pleases you, spare my life and the lives of my people, for we have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and annihilated."
17:7:4:Shocked, the king demanded, "Who is this person? Where is he who has dared to do such a thing?"
17:7:5:Esther answered, "The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman." At her words, Haman trembled with fear before the king and queen.
17:7:6:Enraged, the king got up from the table, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life, realizing that the king had already decided his fate.
17:7:7:When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, he found Haman falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Will he even assault the queen while I am still in the house?" As soon as the king spoke, the servants covered Haman's face.
17:7:8:Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs attending him, said, "There's a gallows seventy-five feet tall at Haman's house, which he had built for Mordecai, who saved the king's life." The king ordered, "Hang him on it!"
17:7:9:So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. And the king's anger subsided.
17:8:1:That same day, King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told him how he was related to her.
17:8:2:The king took off his signet ring, which he had taken back from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. Esther appointed Mordecai over Haman's estate.
17:8:3:Esther approached the king once more, falling at his feet and weeping. She pleaded with him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, who had plotted against the Jews.
17:8:4:The king extended the gold scepter to Esther, and she got up and stood before him.
17:8:5:She said, "If it pleases the king and if I have found favor in his sight, and if this seems right to the king and I am pleasing to him, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
17:8:6:For how can I bear to see the disaster that will come upon my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17:8:7:King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "I have given Haman's estate to Esther, and he has been impaled on the pole because he intended to harm the Jews.
17:8:8:Now write another decree in the king's name on behalf of the Jews, as you see fit, and seal it with the king's signet ring; for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked."
17:8:9:The king's scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month (Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors, and officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces in all, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and also to the Jews in their script and language.
17:8:10:Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on fast horses bred from the royal stables.
17:8:11:In these letters, the king granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and defend themselves; to destroy, kill, and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them, along with their women and children, and to plunder their possessions.
17:8:12:This was to take place on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
17:8:13:A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
17:8:14:The couriers, riding on royal horses, went out in haste, spurred on by the king's command. The edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.
17:8:15:Mordecai left the king's presence wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large golden crown, and a robe of fine linen and purple. The city of Susa held a joyous celebration.
17:8:16:For the Jews, it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor.
17:8:17:In every province and in every city where the edict of the king went, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebration. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
17:9:1:In the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the king's command and his law were to be executed. On this day, the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned, and the Jews gained control over their adversaries.
17:9:2:The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike against those who sought their harm. No one could withstand them, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon all people.
17:9:3:And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those doing the king's work supported the Jews because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
17:9:4:For Mordecai had become powerful in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; indeed, the man Mordecai grew more and more influential.
17:9:5:The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
17:9:6:In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
17:9:7:They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17:9:8:Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17:9:9:Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
17:9:10:the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17:9:11:On that day, the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king.
17:9:12:The king said to Queen Esther, "In the citadel of Susa, the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your request? It will be given to you. And what further do you wish? It will be done."
17:9:13:Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let the Jews in Susa be allowed to do tomorrow as they did today, and let the bodies of Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
17:9:14:The king granted this request, and the decree was issued in Susa. The bodies of Haman's ten sons were hanged.
17:9:15:The Jews in Susa assembled again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred more men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17:9:16:Meanwhile, the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and gained relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, but they did not take any plunder.
17:9:17:This was done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17:9:18:The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and then on the fifteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17:9:19:That is why rural Jews, who live in villages, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to one another.
17:9:20:Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
17:9:21:to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
17:9:22:as the days on which the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. They were to observe these days as days of feasting and joy, giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.
17:9:23:The Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.
17:9:24:For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.
17:9:25:But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree in writing that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
17:9:26:Therefore, these days were called Purim, from the word pur. Because of everything written in this letter and what they had experienced in this matter and what had happened to them,
17:9:27:the Jews established and took upon themselves, their descendants, and all who would join them, an obligation to celebrate these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed.
17:9:28:These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, in every province, and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants.
17:9:29:Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
17:9:30:And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
17:9:31:to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.
17:9:32:The command of Esther confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
17:10:1:King Ahasuerus imposed a tax on his empire's land and islands of the sea.
17:10:2:As for all the acts of his power and might, along with the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king promoted, they are recorded in the Book of Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia.
17:10:3:Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus in rank, highly esteemed among the Jews, and well-liked by many of his relatives. He sought the welfare of his people and spoke up for the well-being of all the Jews.
