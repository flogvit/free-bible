4:1:1:The Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai Desert, within the Tabernacle, on the first day of the second month, during the second year after they had left Egypt.
4:1:2:He said, "Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and families. List every man who is twenty years old or older and able to serve in the army."
4:1:3:So, Moses and Aaron followed the Lord's command and counted the people.
4:1:4:The names of the men who assisted them were as follows: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
4:1:5:from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
4:1:6:from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
4:1:7:from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
4:1:8:from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
4:1:9:from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
4:1:10:from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
4:1:11:from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
4:1:12:from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
4:1:13:from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
4:1:14:and from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.
4:1:15:These men were chosen from the community, leaders of their ancestral tribes and heads of thousands in Israel.
4:1:16:Moses and Aaron took these men, who had been designated by name,
4:1:17:and they assembled the entire community together on the first day of the second month. The people registered their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one,
4:1:18:as the Lord commanded Moses. He counted them in the Sinai Desert.
4:1:19:The total number of Israelite men who were twenty years old or older and able to serve in the army, as listed by their families, was as follows:
4:1:20:From the tribe of Reuben, there were 46,500;
4:1:21:from Simeon, 59,300;
4:1:22:from Gad, 45,650;
4:1:23:from Judah, 74,600;
4:1:24:from Issachar, 54,400;
4:1:25:from Zebulun, 57,400;
4:1:26:from Ephraim, 40,500;
4:1:27:from Manasseh, 32,200;
4:1:28:from Benjamin, 35,400;
4:1:29:from Dan, 62,700;
4:1:30:from Asher, 41,500;
4:1:31:and from Naphtali, 53,400.
4:1:32:So, the total number of Israelite men was 603,550.
4:1:33:However, the Levites were not included in this count, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
4:1:34:Moses, Aaron, and the twelve leaders of Israel followed the Lord's command and counted the people.
4:1:35:These were the Israelites, counted according to their ancestral families. All the men in the camps, by their divisions, who were twenty years old or older and able to serve in the army,
4:1:36:were registered by Moses and Aaron as the Lord had commanded.
4:1:37:The Levites, however, were not included among them, because the Lord had told Moses:
4:1:38:"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.
4:1:39:Instead, assign the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Covenant Law, to be in charge of all its furnishings and everything that belongs to it. They are to carry the Tabernacle and all its furnishings, take care of it, and camp around it.
4:1:40:Whenever the Tabernacle is to move, the Levites will dismantle it, and when it is to be set up, they will assemble it. Anyone else who approaches it must be put to death.
4:1:41:The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his standard.
4:1:42:But the Levites are to camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant Law, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are responsible for the care of the Tabernacle of the Covenant Law."
4:1:43:The Israelites followed all the Lord's instructions to Moses.
4:1:44:So, the Israelites did everything the Lord commanded Moses; that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the way they set out, each with their clan and family.
4:2:1:In those days, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
4:2:2:saying, "The Israelites should set up camp with each person by their own flag, representing their ancestral family. They will encamp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance.
4:2:3:On the east side, toward the sunrise, the divisions of Judah's army will camp under their standard. The leader of Judah's descendants is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
4:2:4:The total number of troops in his division is 74,600.
4:2:5:Next to them, the tribe of Issachar will camp. The leader of Issachar's descendants is Nethanel son of Zuar.
4:2:6:The total number of troops in his division is 54,400.
4:2:7:Then comes the tribe of Zebulun. The leader of Zebulun's descendants is Eliab son of Helon.
4:2:8:The total number of troops in his division is 57,400.
4:2:9:Together, the total number of troops in the camp of Judah is 186,400. They will be the first to move out when the Israelites travel.
4:2:10:On the south side, the divisions of Reuben's army will camp under their standard. The leader of Reuben's descendants is Elizur son of Shedeur.
4:2:11:The total number of troops in his division is 46,500.
4:2:12:Next to them, the tribe of Simeon will camp. The leader of Simeon's descendants is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
4:2:13:The total number of troops in his division is 59,300.
4:2:14:Then comes the tribe of Gad. The leader of Gad's descendants is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
4:2:15:The total number of troops in his division is 45,650.
4:2:16:Together, the total number of troops in the camp of Reuben is 151,450. They will be the second to move out when the Israelites travel.
4:2:17:When it is time to move, the Tent of Meeting will go forward with the Levite camp in the middle of the other camps. Each group will move in the same order they set up camp, each under their own standard.
4:2:18:On the west side, the divisions of Ephraim's army will camp under their standard. The leader of Ephraim's descendants is Elishama son of Ammihud.
4:2:19:The total number of troops in his division is 40,500.
4:2:20:Next to them, the tribe of Manasseh will camp. The leader of Manasseh's descendants is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
4:2:21:The total number of troops in his division is 32,200.
4:2:22:Then comes the tribe of Benjamin. The leader of Benjamin's descendants is Abidan son of Gideoni.
4:2:23:The total number of troops in his division is 35,400.
4:2:24:Together, the total number of troops in the camp of Ephraim is 108,100. They will be the third to move out when the Israelites travel.
4:2:25:On the north side, the divisions of Dan's army will camp under their standard. The leader of Dan's descendants is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
4:2:26:The total number of troops in his division is 62,700.
4:2:27:Next to them, the tribe of Asher will camp. The leader of Asher's descendants is Pagiel son of Ocran.
4:2:28:The total number of troops in his division is 41,500.
4:2:29:Then comes the tribe of Naphtali. The leader of Naphtali's descendants is Ahira son of Enan.
4:2:30:The total number of troops in his division is 53,400.
4:2:31:Together, the total number of troops in the camp of Dan is 157,600. They will be the last to move out when the Israelites travel.
4:2:32:So, these are the Israelites, counted according to their ancestral families. The total number of troops in the camps, by their divisions, is 603,550.
4:2:33:However, the Levites were not included in this count, as the Lord had instructed Moses.
4:2:34:So the Israelites did everything the Lord had commanded Moses. They set up camp under their standards, and they moved out in the same order as they had camped, each with their own ancestral family.
4:3:1:This is the family history of Aaron and Moses, as recorded when the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
4:3:2:The names of Aaron's sons were Nadab (the firstborn), Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
4:3:3:Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord because they offered unauthorized fire in his presence. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under their father Aaron.
4:3:4:The Lord told Moses, "Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
4:3:5:They will perform duties for him and for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
4:3:6:They will take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.
4:3:7:Assign Aaron and his sons the responsibility of priesthood; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death."
4:3:8:Moses brought the Levites to Aaron and his sons, just as the Lord had commanded.
4:3:9:The Lord said to Moses, "I have chosen the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the firstborn, who open the womb among the Israelites. The Levites are mine,
4:3:10:for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am the Lord."
4:3:11:The Lord said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.
4:3:12:Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the Lord."
4:3:13:Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the Lord commanded him.
4:3:14:The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
4:3:15:The Lord said to Moses, "Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the Lord.
4:3:16:To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
4:3:17:collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
4:3:18:Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."
4:3:19:So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.
4:3:20:From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
4:3:21:Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the Lord.
4:4:1: The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:4:2: "Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their families and clans.
4:4:3: Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are qualified to work in the Tent of Meeting.
4:4:4: This is the responsibility of the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting: to care for the most holy things.
4:4:5: When it's time to move the camp, Aaron and his sons must enter the tent and take down the veil of the curtain. They will use it to cover the Ark of the Testimony.
4:4:6: Then they should place a covering of fine leather over it, spread a cloth of solid blue on top, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:7: For the table of the Presence, they should spread a blue cloth and place on it the dishes, pans, bowls, and pitchers for pouring. The bread that is continually there should also be on it.
4:4:8: Next, they should spread a scarlet cloth over it, cover that with fine leather, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:9: They should take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand used for light, along with its lamps, snuffers, trays, and the jars of oil for the lamps.
4:4:10: They should wrap it and all its accessories in fine leather and place them on a carrying frame.
4:4:11: Over the gold altar, they should spread a blue cloth, cover it with fine leather, and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:12: They should take all the utensils used for ministry in the sanctuary, place them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine leather, and put them on a carrying frame.
4:4:13: They must remove the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
4:4:14: They should place on it all the utensils used for the altar service, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and basins. Then they should cover it with fine leather and insert its carrying poles.
4:4:15: After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all their equipment, the Kohathites can come to carry them. But they must not touch the holy things, or they will die. These are the responsibilities of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of Meeting.
4:4:16: Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, will be responsible for the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He is to oversee the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings."
4:4:17: The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:4:18: "Do not let the Kohathite clans be wiped out from among the Levites.
4:4:19: To protect them, do this when they approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons must go in and assign each man his specific task and burden.
4:4:20: The Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die."
4:4:21: The Lord said to Moses,
4:4:22: "Take a census of the Gershonite branch of the Levites by their families and clans.
4:4:23: Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are qualified to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting.
4:4:24: This is the responsibility of the Gershonites: to serve and carry loads.
4:4:25: They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering, the fine leather covering above it, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
4:4:26: the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard, the ropes, and all the equipment used in their service. The Gershonites are responsible for all these items.
4:4:27: All their service, whether carrying or performing other tasks, will be under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You must assign them each their specific task and burden.
4:4:28: This is the service of the Gershonite clans regarding the Tent of Meeting. They will be under the supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
4:4:29: As for the Merarite branch of the Levites, you must count them by their families and clans.
4:4:30: Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are qualified to work in the service of the Tent of Meeting.
4:4:31: This is their responsibility when working at the Tent of Meeting: carrying the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, and bases,
4:4:32: as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, and all their accessories. You must assign each man his specific task by name.
4:4:33: This is the service of the Merarite clans regarding the Tent of Meeting. They will be under the supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest."
4:4:34: Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation counted the Kohathites by their families and clans.
4:4:35: All the men from thirty to fifty years old who were qualified for service in the Tent of Meeting were counted.
4:4:36: The total number from the Kohathite clans was 2,750.
4:4:37: These were the men registered for service in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the Lord's command through Moses.
4:4:38: The Gershonites were counted by their families and clans.
4:4:39: All the men from thirty to fifty years old who were qualified for service in the Tent of Meeting were counted.
4:4:40: The total number from the Gershonite clans was 2,630.
4:4:41: These were the men registered for service in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the Lord's command.
4:4:42: The Merarites were counted by their families and clans.
4:4:43: All the men from thirty to fifty years old who were qualified for service in the Tent of Meeting were counted.
4:4:44: The total number from the Merarite clans was 3,200.
4:4:45: These were the men registered for service in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the Lord's command through Moses.
4:4:46: So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their families and clans.
4:4:47: All the men from thirty to fifty years old who were qualified for service in the Tent of Meeting and for carrying loads were counted.
4:4:48: The total number was 8,580.
4:4:49: At the Lord's command through Moses, each man was assigned his work and told what to carry. Thus, they were counted as the Lord had commanded Moses.
4:5:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:5:2:"Instruct the Israelites to expel from the camp anyone who has a skin disease, a discharge, or has become unclean due to contact with a dead body.
4:5:3:Both male and female must be sent outside the camp, so they won't defile it where I dwell among them."
4:5:4:So the Israelites followed these instructions and removed such individuals from the camp; they did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
4:5:5:Moses was told by the Lord,
4:5:6:"Say to the Israelites: If a man or woman commits any sin against another person, they have broken faith with the Lord and are guilty.
4:5:7:They must confess their sin, make full restitution for the wrong done, adding one-fifth to it, and give it to the person they have wronged.
4:5:8:If the person has no relative to whom restitution can be made, the payment belongs to the Lord and must be given to the priest, along with a ram as a guilt offering.
4:5:9:Every sacred contribution the Israelites bring to the priest will belong to him.
4:5:10:Each person's holy gifts are their own, but whatever they give to the priest will belong to him."
4:5:11:Then the Lord said to Moses,
4:5:12:"Speak to the Israelites and tell them: If a man suspects that his wife has been unfaithful and she has defiled herself,
4:5:13:but there is no witness of her adultery and she has not been caught in the act,
4:5:14:and if he is overcome with jealousy and suspicion, even though she may not have defiled herself, he must bring her to the priest.
4:5:15:The man must bring an offering for his wife: one-tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He must not pour oil or put frankincense on it because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.
4:5:16:The priest will bring her forward and have her stand before the Lord.
4:5:17:He will take holy water in a clay jar and add some dust from the tabernacle floor.
4:5:18:Then, while the woman stands before the Lord, the priest will loosen her hair and place the reminder-offering in her hands—the grain offering for jealousy—while holding the bitter water that brings a curse.
4:5:19:The priest will then make her take an oath and say to her, 'If no man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.
4:5:20:But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and have defiled yourself by sleeping with another man—
4:5:21:at this point, the priest will pronounce the curse—may the Lord cause your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell,
4:5:22:and may this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away.' Then the woman must say, 'Amen, Amen.'
4:5:23:The priest will write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
4:5:24:He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and it will enter her and cause bitter suffering.
4:5:25:The priest will take the grain offering for jealousy from the woman's hand, wave it before the Lord, and bring it to the altar.
4:5:26:He will take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Afterward, he will make the woman drink the water.
4:5:27:If she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and she will become a curse among her people.
4:5:28:But if she has not defiled herself and is pure, she will be unaffected and able to conceive children.
4:5:29:This is the law concerning jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while married to her husband,
4:5:30:or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest must have her stand before the Lord and apply this entire law to her.
4:5:31:The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin."
4:6:1:The Lord instructed Moses,
4:6:2:"Speak to the Israelites and say, 'When a man or woman decides to make a special vow as a Nazirite, dedicating themselves to the Lord,
4:6:3:they must abstain from wine and other fermented drinks. They must not drink vinegar made from wine or any other fermented drink, nor consume grapes or raisins.
4:6:4:As long as they are under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, including seeds and skins.
4:6:5:During the time of their vow, no razor shall touch their head. Until the period of their dedication to the Lord is over, they must let their hair grow long.
4:6:6:Throughout the duration of their vow, they must not go near a dead body,
4:6:7:not even if it's their father, mother, brother, or sister who has died. Because their dedication to God requires them to remain ceremonially clean, they cannot defile themselves.
4:6:8:As long as they are dedicated to the Lord, they are holy and must maintain their separation.
4:6:9:If someone dies suddenly in their presence, thus defiling their consecrated head, they must shave their head on the day of their cleansing; on the seventh day they shall shave it.
4:6:10:On the eighth day, they are to bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
4:6:11:The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for them because they were defiled by the dead body. On the same day, they will reconsecrate their head
4:6:12:and rededicate themselves to the Lord for the remaining duration of their vow, bringing a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count because they were defiled during their vow.
4:6:13:This is the law of the Nazirite when the time of their dedication is completed: They must present themselves at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
4:6:14:They shall bring their offerings to the Lord: one unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, one unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, and one unblemished ram as a fellowship offering,
4:6:15:along with their grain offerings, drink offerings, and a basket of unleavened bread made from fine flour mixed with oil, and thin unleavened wafers spread with oil.
4:6:16:The priest will present these before the Lord and make the sin offering and burnt offering.
4:6:17:He will also offer the ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord, together with the grain offering and drink offering.
4:6:18:At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite must shave their consecrated head, take the hair, and put it in the fire that is under the fellowship offering.
4:6:19:After the Nazirite's head has been shaved, the priest will take a boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and place them in the hands of the Nazirite.
4:6:20:The priest will then wave them before the Lord as a wave offering; this is a holy portion for the priest, along with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering. Afterward, the Nazirite may drink wine.
4:6:21:This is the law for the Nazirite who takes a vow, including their offering to the Lord for their dedication, in addition to any other offerings they can afford. They must fulfill the specific vow they made, following the law of the Nazirite."
4:6:22:Then the Lord said to Moses,
4:6:23:"Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
4:6:24:The Lord bless you and protect you;
4:6:25:The Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you;
4:6:26:The Lord turn His face toward you and grant you peace.'
4:6:27:In this way, they will put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them."
4:7:1:On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings, and also the altar and all its utensils, he anointed and consecrated them.
4:7:2:Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses who were the tribal chiefs, came forward. These men were the ones who stood over those numbered.
4:7:3:They brought their offerings before the Lord: six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two leaders and an ox for each one. They presented these before the tabernacle.
4:7:4:The Lord said to Moses,
4:7:5:"Accept these offerings from them to be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man's work requires."
4:7:6:Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
4:7:7:He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,
4:7:8:and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
4:7:9:But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.
4:7:10:When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.
4:7:11:For the Lord had said to Moses, "Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar."
4:7:12:The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.
4:7:13:His offering was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
4:7:14:one gold dish weighing 10 shekels, filled with incense;
4:7:15:one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;
4:7:16:one male goat for a sin offering;
4:7:17:and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs a year old, to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab.
4:7:18:On the second day Nethanel son of Zuar, the leader of Issachar, brought his offering.
4:7:19:The offering he brought was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
4:7:20:one gold dish weighing 10 shekels, filled with incense;
4:7:21:one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;
4:7:22:one male goat for a sin offering;
4:7:23:and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs a year old, to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nethanel son of Zuar.
4:7:24:On the third day, Eliab son of Helon, the leader of the people of Zebulun, presented his offering.
4:7:25:His offering was one silver plate weighing 130 shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing 70 shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with the finest flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering;
4:7:26:one gold dish weighing 10 shekels, filled with incense;
4:7:27:one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;

4:7:86:The total weight of the gold dishes was 120 shekels, also according to the sanctuary shekel.
4:7:87:Each of the twelve leaders brought the following for the dedication of the altar: one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old as a burnt offering;

4:7:91:The total number of animals for the fellowship offering came to twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats and sixty male lambs a year old. These were the offerings for the dedication of the altar after it was anointed.
4:8:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:8:2:"Tell Aaron that when he sets up the seven lamps, they should shine toward the front of the lampstand."
4:8:3:Aaron did this, positioning the lamps so they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
4:8:4:The lampstand was made of hammered gold, from its base to its blossoms. It was crafted according to the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.
4:8:5:The Lord said to Moses,
4:8:6:"Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them."
4:8:7:To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of purification on them, have them shave their entire bodies, and wash their clothes. Then they will be ceremonially clean.
4:8:8:They must also bring a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and another young bull for a sin offering.
4:8:9:Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting and gather the whole Israelite community.
4:8:10:Present the Levites before the Lord, and the Israelites shall lay their hands on them.
4:8:11:Aaron is to present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the Lord.
4:8:12:Next, the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, one to be used for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.
4:8:13:Stand the Levites in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as a wave offering to the Lord.
4:8:14:In this way, you will set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.
4:8:15:Afterward, the Levites may come to serve at the Tent of Meeting, once you have purified them and presented them as a wave offering.
4:8:16:For they are wholly given to me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for myself in place of all the firstborn who open the womb among the Israelites.
4:8:17:Every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.
4:8:18:And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
4:8:19:From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the Tent of Meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary."
4:8:20:Moses, Aaron, and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.
4:8:21:The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to purify them.
4:8:22:After that, the Levites came to do their work at the Tent of Meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They carried out all that the Lord had commanded through Moses concerning the Levites.
4:8:23:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:8:24:"This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the Tent of Meeting,
4:8:25:but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer.
4:8:26:They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the Tent of Meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites."
4:9:1:In the first month of the second year after they left Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai Desert.
4:9:2:He said, "The Israelites must celebrate the Passover at the proper time.
4:9:3:On the evening of the fourteenth day of this month, they are to observe it according to all its rules and regulations."
4:9:4:Moses instructed the Israelites to celebrate the Passover.
4:9:5:So, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month, they observed the Passover in the Sinai Desert, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
4:9:6:But there were some men who were ceremonially unclean because of a dead body and could not celebrate the Passover that day. They came to Moses and Aaron
4:9:7:and said, "We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the Lord's offering at the appointed time with the rest of the Israelites?"
4:9:8:Moses replied, "Wait here, and I will ask the Lord what to do about your situation."
4:9:9:The Lord said to Moses,
4:9:10:"Tell the Israelites: 'If any of you or your descendants become unclean because of a dead body, or if you are away on a journey, you may still celebrate the Lord's Passover.
4:9:11:You shall observe it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. You are to eat the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
4:9:12:Do not leave any of it until morning, and do not break any of its bones. Observe all the regulations for the Passover.'"
4:9:13:But if a person is clean and not on a journey, yet still does not observe the Passover, that individual shall be cut off from their people for not presenting the Lord's offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin.
4:9:14:"A foreigner living among you who wants to celebrate the Lord's Passover must follow the same rules and regulations as you. There is to be one law for both the native-born and the foreigner.'"
4:9:15:On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening until morning, the cloud appeared over the tabernacle, looking like fire.
4:9:16:This is how it continued to be; the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day, and at night it looked like fire.
4:9:17:Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites would set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites would camp.
4:9:18:At the Lord's command through Moses, the Israelites would set out, and at the Lord's command through Moses, they would camp. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they stayed in place.
4:9:19:When the cloud remained over the tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites obeyed the Lord's order and did not set out.
4:9:20:Sometimes the cloud was only over the tabernacle for a few days; according to the Lord's command, they would remain in camp and then set out.
4:9:21:And sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening until morning; when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.
4:9:22:Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.
4:9:23:At the Lord's command, they encamped, and at the Lord's command, they set out. They obeyed the Lord's order, in accordance with his command through Moses.
4:10:1:The Lord instructed Moses:
4:10:2:"Create two silver trumpets; make them from hammered work. They will be used to summon the community and give signals for breaking camp.
4:10:3:When both trumpets are blown, the entire community should gather before you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
4:10:4:If only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders of the tribes who are heads of the Israelites should gather around you.
4:10:5:When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east side should set out.
4:10:6:At the sound of a second blast, those camping on the south side should depart. The trumpet blasts will signal their departure.
4:10:7:To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets without sounding an alarm.
4:10:8:The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
4:10:9:When you go into battle in your land against an enemy who oppresses you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the Lord your God and saved from your enemies.
4:10:10:On your days of rejoicing, during your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts, you must also blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. These trumpet blasts will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the Lord your God."
4:10:11:In the second year, during the second month and on the twentieth day, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law.
4:10:12:Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
4:10:13:They set out, for the first time, according to the command of the Lord through Moses.
4:10:14:The banner of the camp of Judah went first, led by Nahshon son of Amminadab.
4:10:15:Nethanel son of Zuar was in charge of the tribe of Issachar,
4:10:16:and Eliab son of Helon led the tribe of Zebulun.
4:10:17:Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.
4:10:18:The banner of the camp of Reuben went next, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
4:10:19:Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai led the tribe of Simeon,
4:10:20:and Eliasaph son of Deuel commanded the tribe of Gad.
4:10:21:Next, the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
4:10:22:The banner of the camp of Ephraim went next, led by Elishama son of Ammihud.
4:10:23:Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanded the tribe of Manasseh,
4:10:24:and Abidan son of Gideoni led the tribe of Benjamin.
4:10:25:Finally, the banner of the camp of Dan, functioning as the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command.
4:10:26:Pagiel son of Ocran led the tribe of Asher,
4:10:27:and Ahira son of Enan commanded the tribe of Naphtali.
4:10:28:This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
4:10:29:Moses said to Hobab, son of Reuel the Midianite and Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the Lord said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the Lord has promised good things to Israel."
4:10:30:Hobab answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."
4:10:31:But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
4:10:32:If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the Lord gives us."
4:10:33:So they set out from the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days. The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord went before them during those three days to find a resting place
4:10:34:for them.
4:10:35:The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
4:10:36:Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, "Rise up, Lord! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you."
4:10:37:And when it came to rest, he would say, "Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel."
4:11:1:Now, when the people started complaining openly before the Lord about their hardships, He heard them and became angry.
4:11:2:Then the Lord's fire burned against them and consumed the outskirts of the camp.
4:11:3:When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the Lord, and the fire died down.
4:11:4:So that place was named Taberah because the Lord's fire had burned among them there.
4:11:5:The Israelites began to crave the tasty food they had enjoyed in Egypt, and they wept again.
4:11:6:They said, "If only we had meat to eat!
4:11:7:We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
4:11:8:But now our appetite is gone; all we ever see is this manna!"
4:11:9:Manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance resembled that of bdellium.
4:11:10:The people would gather it, grind it in a mill or crush it in a mortar, then cook it in a pot or make it into cakes. It tasted like fresh oil.
4:11:11:When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
4:11:12:Moses heard the people of every family crying at the entrance of their tents. The Lord was very angry, and Moses was troubled.
4:11:13:He asked the Lord, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
4:11:14:Did I conceive these people? Did I give birth to them, that you should tell me to carry them in my arms like a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors?
4:11:15:Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!'
4:11:16:I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
4:11:17:If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin."
4:11:18:The Lord said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy elders of Israel, men you know as leaders and officers among the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting, so they may stand there with you.
4:11:19:I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.
4:11:20:Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat. You have wept in the hearing of the Lord, saying, "Who will give us meat to eat? We were better off in Egypt!" The Lord will give you meat, and you will eat.
4:11:21:You will not eat it for just one day or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
4:11:22:but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the Lord who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"
4:11:23:Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'
4:11:24:Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"
4:11:25:The Lord answered Moses, "Is the Lord's arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you."
4:11:26:Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.
4:11:27:Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again.
4:11:28:However, two men, named Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders but did not go out to the Tent.
4:11:29:Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.
4:11:30:A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
4:11:31:Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"
4:11:32:But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!"
4:11:33:Later, a wind sent by the Lord came up and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits deep all around the camp, as far as a day's walk in any direction.
4:11:34:All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
4:11:35:But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the Lord burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
4:11:36:Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
4:11:37:From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
4:12:1:While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron started to criticize Moses because of his Cushite wife he had married.
4:12:2:They said, "Has the Lord only spoken through Moses? Hasn't He also spoken through us?" And the Lord heard them.
4:12:3:Moses was a very humble man, more so than anyone else on earth.
4:12:4:Suddenly, the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting." So they went there.
4:12:5:Then the Lord descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent. He called Aaron and Miriam, and they both stepped forward.
4:12:6:The Lord said, "Listen carefully to my words: When there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will reveal myself to him in visions and speak to him in dreams.
4:12:7:But this is not true for my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
4:12:8:With him, I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to criticize my servant Moses?"
4:12:9:The Lord's anger burned against them, and He left them.
4:12:10:When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam's skin was leprous—it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a skin disease.
4:12:11:Aaron said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have foolishly committed.
4:12:12:Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."
4:12:13:So Moses cried out to the Lord, "O God, please heal her!"
4:12:14:The Lord replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that, she can be brought back."
4:12:15:So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back.
4:12:16:After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
4:13:1:Now, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4:13:2:"Send out men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. Choose one leader from each ancestral tribe."
4:13:3:So Moses obeyed the LORD's command and sent them from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders among the Israelites.
4:13:4:These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
4:13:5:from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
4:13:6:from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
4:13:7:from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
4:13:8:from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
4:13:9:from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
4:13:10:from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
4:13:11:from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
4:13:12:from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
4:13:13:from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
4:13:14:from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
4:13:15:from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
4:13:16:Moses sent them to explore Canaan, instructing them, "Go up through the Negev and into the hill country.
4:13:17:See what the land is like, and whether the people living there are strong or weak, few or many.
4:13:18:Examine the land itself, whether it is good or bad, and the cities they inhabit, whether they live in camps or fortified settlements.
4:13:19:Also, check the fertility of the soil and whether there are trees. Bring back some fruit from the land." It was the season for the first ripe grapes.
4:13:20:So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.
4:13:21:They traveled through the Negev and arrived at Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
4:13:22:When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men, along with some pomegranates and figs.
4:13:23:That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
4:13:24:At the end of forty days, they returned from exploring the land.
4:13:25:They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. They reported to them and showed them the fruit of the land.
4:13:26:They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.
4:13:27:However, the people living in the land are powerful, and their cities are large and fortified. We even saw descendants of Anak there.
4:13:28:The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanites are by the sea and along the Jordan."
4:13:29:Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."
4:13:30:But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."
4:13:31:They spread a bad report about the land among the Israelites, saying, "The land we explored devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there are of great size.
4:13:32:We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We felt like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we must have looked the same to them."
4:14:1:That night, all the people in the community raised their voices and cried out loud.
4:14:2:The Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, "If only we had died in Egypt or here in the wilderness!
4:14:3:Why is the Lord bringing us to this land just to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
4:14:4:So they said to one another, "Let's choose a leader and return to Egypt."
4:14:5:Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole assembly of the Israelite community.
4:14:6:Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes
4:14:7:and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.
4:14:8:If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
4:14:9:Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them."
4:14:10:But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.
4:14:11:The Lord said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?
4:14:12:I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."
4:14:13:Moses said to the Lord, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
4:14:14:And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, Lord, are with these people and that you, Lord, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
4:14:15:If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,
4:14:16:'The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
4:14:17:"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:
4:14:18:'The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.'
4:14:19:In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."
4:14:20:The Lord replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.
4:14:21:Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth,
4:14:22:not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—
4:14:23:not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
4:14:24:But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
4:14:25:Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea."
4:14:26:The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
4:14:27:"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
4:14:28:So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:
4:14:29:In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
4:14:30:Not one of you
4:14:31:But your little ones, whom you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring in, and they will know the land you have rejected.
4:14:32:As for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
4:14:33:Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.
4:14:34:For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'
4:14:35:I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die."
4:14:36:So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—
4:14:37:these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord.
4:14:38:Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
4:14:39:When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
4:14:40:Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, "Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised. Surely we have sinned!"
4:14:41:But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the Lord's command? This will not succeed!
4:14:42:Do not go up, because the Lord is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,
4:14:43:for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the Lord, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."
4:14:44:Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp.
4:14:45:Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
4:15:1:Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
4:15:2:"Tell the Israelites that when you enter the land I am giving you, and you settle there,
4:15:3:you shall make an offering to Yahweh from the first of your crops, a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma.
4:15:4:This offering shall be accompanied by a grain offering of two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of olive oil,
4:15:5:and a drink offering of one quart of wine for each lamb.
4:15:6:For a ram, prepare a grain offering of four quarts of fine flour mixed with one and a third quarts of olive oil,
4:15:7:and a drink offering of one and a third quarts of wine as a pleasing aroma to Yahweh.
4:15:8:When you offer a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice for a special vow or fellowship offering to Yahweh,
4:15:9:include a grain offering of six quarts of fine flour mixed with two quarts of olive oil,
4:15:10:and a drink offering of two quarts of wine.
4:15:11:Each bull, ram, or lamb offered must be accompanied by these appropriate offerings, according to their number.
4:15:12:All native-born Israelites must follow these instructions when presenting an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to Yahweh.
4:15:13:If foreigners living among you wish to present an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to Yahweh, they must do the same.
4:15:14:There will be one law for both the native-born and the foreigner who resides among you."
4:15:15:Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, and they obeyed Yahweh's command.
4:15:16:Yahweh spoke to Moses again, saying,
4:15:17:"Speak to the Israelites and tell them that when you enter the land where I am bringing you,
4:15:18:and you eat the bread of the land, you shall set aside a portion as an offering to Yahweh.
4:15:19:From the first batch of dough, take a cake as a contribution; offer it just as you would offer a portion from the threshing floor.
4:15:20:Throughout your generations, you shall give this offering to Yahweh from the first of your dough.
4:15:21:Now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands that Yahweh has given to Moses,
4:15:22:and you commit a sin unknowingly, the entire community must present a young bull for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to Yahweh, along with its prescribed grain and drink offerings, and a male goat for a sin offering.
4:15:23:The priest will make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven because it was unintentional, and they have brought their offering before Yahweh.
4:15:24:The whole community of Israel and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, for all the people were involved in the unintentional offense.
4:15:25:If an individual sins unintentionally, they must bring a female goat one year old as a sin offering.
4:15:26:The priest will make atonement for the person who erred unintentionally before Yahweh, and they will be forgiven.
4:15:27:Both native-born Israelites and foreigners living among them must have the same law when they sin unintentionally.
4:15:28:But if someone sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, they are blaspheming Yahweh, and they must be cut off from their people.
4:15:29:They have despised Yahweh's word and broken his commandments; they shall bear the consequences of their guilt."
4:15:30:While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
4:15:31:Those who found him brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,
4:15:32:and they kept him in custody because it was not clear what should be done to him.
4:15:33:Then Yahweh said to Moses, "This man must be put to death; the whole community shall stone him outside the camp."
4:15:34:So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
4:15:35:Yahweh said to Moses,
4:15:36:"Instruct the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue cord on each tassel.
4:15:37:These tassels will remind you of the commandments of Yahweh, so that you may obey them and not follow your own desires or go astray.
4:15:38:By remembering and obeying all my commandments, you will be holy to your God.
4:15:39:I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God; I am Yahweh your God."
4:16:1:One day, Korah, the son of Izhar, along with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On, son of Peleth—all from the tribe of Reuben—gathered together.
4:16:2:They were joined by 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
4:16:3:Together, they confronted Moses and Aaron, saying, "You've taken too much upon yourselves, seeing that the entire congregation is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?"
4:16:4:Moses, hearing this, fell on his face.
4:16:5:He spoke to Korah and all his followers, saying, "Tomorrow morning, the Lord will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will allow that person to approach Him. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself.
4:16:6:Do this, Korah and your followers: Take censers,
4:16:7:and put fire and incense in them before the Lord tomorrow. The man whom the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy. You have gone too far, sons of Levi!"
4:16:8:Then Moses said to Korah, "Listen now, you Levites!
4:16:9:Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near to Himself to do the work at the Lord's tabernacle and to stand before the congregation and minister to them?
4:16:10:He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near to Himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood as well.
4:16:11:It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"
4:16:12:Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, "We will not come!
4:16:13:Isn't it enough that you brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Now you also want to lord it over us?
4:16:14:Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can deceive these men? We will not come!"
4:16:15:Angered by their response, Moses said to the Lord, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."
4:16:16:Moses then said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the Lord tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.
4:16:17:Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the Lord. You and Aaron are to do the same with your censers."
4:16:18:So each of them took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
4:16:19:When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly.
4:16:20:The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
4:16:21:"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."
4:16:22:But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"
4:16:23:Then the Lord said to Moses,
4:16:24:"Tell the assembly to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
4:16:25:Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
4:16:26:He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."
4:16:27:So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children, and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
4:16:28:Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:
4:16:29:If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the Lord has not sent me.
4:16:30:But if the Lord brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the Lord with contempt."
4:16:31:As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
4:16:32:and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions.
4:16:33:They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.
4:16:34:At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"
4:16:35:And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
4:16:36:The Lord said to Moses,
4:16:37:"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy.
4:16:38:The censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives are to be hammered into sheets to overlay the altar, because they presented them before the Lord and have become holy. Let them serve as a sign to the Israelites."
4:16:39:So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
4:16:40:as the Lord directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the Lord, or they would become like Korah and his followers.
4:16:41:The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the Lord's people," they said.
4:16:42:But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.
4:16:43:Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,
4:16:44:and the Lord said to Moses,
4:16:45:"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.
4:16:46:Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the Lord; the plague has started."
4:16:47:So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.
4:16:48:He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.
4:16:49:But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.
4:16:50:Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
4:17:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:17:2:"Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers from the fire, and scatter the coals far away. The censers of these sinners are holy because they offered them before the Lord.
4:17:3:Make hammered plates from the censers as a covering for the altar, for they were presented before the Lord and have become holy. Let them serve as a sign to the Israelites."
4:17:4:So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers that had been brought by those who were burned up, and hammered them out to cover the altar.
4:17:5:This was a reminder for the Israelites, so that no outsider who was not a descendant of Aaron would come near to offer incense before the Lord, lest they suffer the same fate as Korah and his followers.
4:17:6:The next day, the entire community of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the Lord's people!"
4:17:7:As the community gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the Tent of Meeting. Suddenly, the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.
4:17:8:Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
4:17:9:The Lord said to Moses,
4:17:10:"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once!" But Moses and Aaron fell facedown.
4:17:11:Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, add incense, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. The Lord's anger has broken out and a plague has begun."
4:17:12:Aaron did as Moses instructed and ran to the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but he offered the incense and made atonement for them.
4:17:13:He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was stopped.
4:17:14:The number of those who died in the plague was 14,700, not counting those who died because of Korah.
4:17:15:When the plague was halted, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
4:18:1:The Lord said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and your family are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, while you and your sons alone will bear the responsibility for offenses related to the priesthood.
4:18:2:Also bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the Tent of the Covenant Law.
4:18:3:They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die.
4:18:4:They are to join you and guard the tent of meeting for all the work at the tent, and no one else may come near where you are.
4:18:5:You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
4:18:6:I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord to do the work at the tent of meeting.
4:18:7:But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Any unauthorized person who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death."
4:18:8:Then the Lord said to Aaron, "I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share.
4:18:9:You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.
4:18:10:Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
4:18:11:This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
4:18:12:I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest.
4:18:13:All the land's firstfruits that they bring to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
4:18:14:Everything in Israel that is devoted to the Lord is yours.
4:18:15:The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the Lord is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
4:18:16:When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
4:18:17:But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
4:18:18:Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.
4:18:19:Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the Lord I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your offspring."
4:18:20:The Lord said to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.
4:18:21:I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.
4:18:22:From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die.
4:18:23:It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.
4:18:24:Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the Lord. That is why I said concerning them: 'They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.'"
4:18:25:The Lord said to Moses,
4:18:26:"Speak to the Levites and say to them: 'When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the Lord's offering.
4:18:27:Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
4:18:28:In this way you also will present an offering to the Lord from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the Lord's portion to Aaron the priest.
4:18:29:You must present as the Lord's portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.'
4:18:30:"Say to the Levites: 'When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress.
4:18:31:You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting.
4:18:32:By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.'"
4:19:1:The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
4:19:2:"This is a requirement from the law that God has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish, one that has never worn a yoke.
4:19:3:Give it to Eleazar the priest; he will take it outside the camp and have it slaughtered in his presence.
4:19:4:Eleazar shall then take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
4:19:5:While watching, he must have the heifer burned in its entirety—its skin, flesh, blood, and dung.
4:19:6:The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
4:19:7:Afterward, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. He may then return to the camp, but he remains unclean until evening.
4:19:8:The one who burns the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, remaining unclean until evening.
4:19:9:A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and store them outside the camp in a clean place. These ashes will be used by the Israelite community for the water of purification, which is for cleansing from sin.
4:19:10:The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer must wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean until evening. This is a lasting ordinance for both the Israelites and any foreigner residing among them.
4:19:11:Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:12:They must purify themselves with the water of purification on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean.
4:19:13:If someone touches a corpse and does not purify themselves, they defile the Lord's tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Since the water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, they remain unclean.
4:19:14:This is the law for when someone dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is already inside the tent will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:15:Every open container without a lid fastened on it will also be unclean.
4:19:16:Anyone out in the open field who touches a dead body—whether killed by a weapon or having died naturally—or who touches a human bone or grave will be unclean for seven days.
4:19:17:For the unclean person, take some ashes from the burnt offering for purification and add fresh water to them in a container.
4:19:18:A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all its furnishings, and the people who were there. Also, the one who touched the bone, the slain person, the corpse, or the grave must be sprinkled.
4:19:19:The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day. On the seventh day, the unclean person must purify themselves, wash their clothes, and bathe in water, and at evening, they will be clean.
4:19:20:If an unclean person does not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean.
4:19:21:This is a lasting ordinance. The one who sprinkles the water of purification must also wash their clothes, and anyone who touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening.
4:19:22:Anything an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening."
4:20:1:In the first month, the Israelites arrived at the Zin Desert, and they settled in Kadesh. There, Miriam passed away and was buried.
4:20:2:There was no water for the community, so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.
4:20:3:The people complained to Moses, saying, "If only we had died when our fellow Israelites perished before the Lord!
4:20:4:Why have you brought the Lord's assembly into this desert, only for us and our livestock to die here?
4:20:5:Why did you lead us out of Egypt just to bring us to this terrible place? It's not a land of grain, figs, grapevines, or pomegranates, and there's no water to drink!"
4:20:6:Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, where they fell on their faces. The glory of the Lord appeared to them,
4:20:7:and the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:20:8:"Take your staff, gather the people, and go with your brother Aaron. Speak to the rock in front of them, and it will yield water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community and their livestock to drink."
4:20:9:Moses took the staff from the Lord's presence as he had been instructed.
4:20:10:He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, "Listen now, you rebels! Must we bring water out of this rock for you?"
4:20:11:Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
4:20:12:But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I have given them."
4:20:13:These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the Lord, and He showed Himself holy among them.
4:20:14:Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying, "This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardships we have faced,
4:20:15:how our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there for a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,
4:20:16:but when we cried out to the Lord, He heard our cry and sent an angel to rescue us. Now we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
4:20:17:Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, nor drink water from any well. We will travel along the King's Highway, not turning to the right or the left until we have passed through your territory."
4:20:18:But Edom answered, "You may not pass through here; if you try, we will come out and attack you with the sword."
4:20:19:The Israelites replied, "We will stay on the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else."
4:20:20:Again, Edom refused to let them pass through their territory. So the Israelites turned away from them.
4:20:21:They left Kadesh and journeyed to Mount Hor, which is on the border of Edom.
4:20:22:At Mount Hor, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
4:20:23:"Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I have given the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
4:20:24:Take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor,
4:20:25:and remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will die there and be gathered to his people."
4:20:26:Moses did as the Lord commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
4:20:27:Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,
4:20:28:and when the whole community learned that Aaron had passed away, they mourned for him thirty days.
4:21:1:The Israelites journeyed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
4:21:2:From there, they moved on to Punon and set up camp.
4:21:3:Next, they traveled to Oboth and made camp.
4:21:4:Afterward, they went to the valley of Moab where the Arnon River is, at the border of the Amorite territory.
4:21:5:Here, the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for water, and He responded by telling Moses to speak to the rock so that it would produce water.
4:21:6:However, instead of speaking to the rock, Moses struck it twice with his staff, causing water to flow out. The place was called Meribah because the Israelites quarreled there and tested the Lord, asking, "Is the Lord among us or not?"
4:21:7:They continued their journey from there to Beer, where the Lord provided a well for the people.
4:21:8:In this place, they sang a song of praise, saying, "Spring up, O well! Sing to it!"
4:21:9:From Beer, they went to Mattanah.
4:21:10:Then, they moved on to Nahaliel and camped.
4:21:11:Following that, they traveled to Bamoth and made camp.
4:21:12:Finally, they arrived in the valley near the Pisgah peak, overlooking the wasteland.
4:21:13:Now, the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, requesting passage through his land.
4:21:14:But Sihon refused to let them pass, and he gathered his army to attack Israel.
4:21:15:The Israelites defeated Sihon and his army, taking possession of his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River.
4:21:16:They also captured all the cities along the way and occupied them, including Heshbon, the capital city of Sihon's kingdom.
4:21:17:During this time, the Israelites composed a song about their victory, which said, "Come to Heshbon! Let it be rebuilt! Let Sihon's city be restored!"
4:21:18:For a fire had gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, consuming Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
4:21:19:Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon, king of the Amorites.
4:21:20:We have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba."
4:21:21:After defeating the Amorites, the Israelites also conquered the territory of King Og of Bashan, who was one of the last remaining giants.
4:21:22:His bed was made of iron and measured more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide.
4:21:23:With these victories, the Israelites now controlled the entire region east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River in the south to Mount Hermon in the north.
4:21:24:They settled in the conquered lands, dividing it among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
4:22:1: At that time, the Israelites were camped along the Jordan River across from Jericho. Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
4:22:2: Balak was terrified of the Israelites because there were so many of them. He and the people of Moab were filled with dread.
4:22:3: The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde will devour everything around us, just as an ox devours grass in the field." So Balak, Zippor's son, who was king of Moab at that time,
4:22:4: sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor near the Euphrates River in his native land. Balak's message to Balaam said, "Look, a people has come out of Egypt and now covers the face of the earth. They are encamped next to me.
4:22:5: Please come and put a curse on these people, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps if you curse them, I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."
4:22:6: So the elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they arrived at Balaam's place, they relayed Balak's message to him.
4:22:7: Balaam said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will give you my answer after I have consulted the Lord." So the Moabite officials stayed with Balaam.
4:22:8: That night, God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
4:22:9: Balaam replied, "They are messengers from Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab. They have come with this message:
4:22:10: 'A people has come out of Egypt and now covers the face of the earth. Come, curse them for me. Perhaps I can fight against them and drive them away.'"
4:22:11: But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not curse these people, for they are blessed."
4:22:12: The next morning, Balaam got up and told Balak's officials, "Go back to your own land, because the Lord has refused to let me go with you."
4:22:13: So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and reported, "Balaam refused to come with us."
4:22:14: Balak sent another group of officials, more numerous and distinguished than the first.
4:22:15: They came to Balaam and delivered this message from Balak: "Please don't let anything keep you from coming to me.
4:22:16: I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Please come and curse these people for me."
4:22:17: Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small that goes against the command of the Lord my God.
4:22:18: Now spend the night here, as the others did, so I can find out what else the Lord might tell me."
4:22:19: That night, God came to Balaam again and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you to do."
4:22:20: So the next morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials.
4:22:21: As he was going, God's anger flared up because Balaam was going, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
4:22:22: The donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. The donkey turned off the road into a field, but Balaam beat her to get her back on the path.
4:22:23: Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.
4:22:24: When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again.
4:22:25: The angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.
4:22:26: When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam, and he became angry and beat her with his staff.
4:22:27: Then the Lord opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?"
4:22:28: Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."
4:22:29: The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he replied.
4:22:30: Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.
4:22:31: The angel of the Lord asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.
4:22:32: The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her."
4:22:33: Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."
4:22:34: The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials.
4:22:35: When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
4:22:36: Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"
4:22:37: Balaam replied, "I have come to you now, but I can't say whatever I please. I can only speak the words God puts in my mouth."
4:22:38: Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
4:22:39: Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him.
4:22:40: The next morning, Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.
4:23:1:Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
4:23:2:Balak did as Balaam had asked, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:23:3:Balaam told Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me. Whatever He shows me, I will tell you." And he went to a barren height.
4:23:4:God met with Balaam, who said to Him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
4:23:5:The Lord gave Balaam a message and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
4:23:6:So he returned to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering with all the leaders of Moab.
4:23:7:Balaam spoke his message: "From Aram, Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'
4:23:8:How can I curse whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?
4:23:9:I see them from the rocky peaks; I view them from the hills. They are a people living apart, not reckoning themselves among the nations.
4:23:10:Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"
4:23:11:Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them instead!"
4:23:12:Balaam answered, "Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?"
4:23:13:Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."
4:23:14:So he took him to the field of Zophim, on the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars there. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:23:15:Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with God over there."
4:23:16:The Lord met with Balaam and gave him a message. He said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
4:23:17:So he went to Balak, who was standing by his burnt offering with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the Lord say?"
4:23:18:Balaam spoke his message: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.
4:23:19:God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a human being, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and then not act? Does He promise and not fulfill?
4:23:20:I have received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot change it.
4:23:21:No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The Lord their God is with them; the King's shout of praise is among them.
4:23:22:God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
4:23:23:There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what God has done!'
4:23:24:The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest until it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims."
4:23:25:Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them nor bless them!"
4:23:26:Balaam replied, "Didn't I tell you that I must do whatever the Lord says?"
4:23:27:Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there."
4:23:28:So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
4:23:29:Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
4:23:30:Balak did as Balaam had asked, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4:24:1:As Balaam looked up, he saw Israel camped tribe by tribe. The Spirit of God came upon him,
4:24:2:and he began to speak his message: "This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the vision of the man whose eyes are opened,
4:24:3:the revelation of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, though falling into a trance with his eyes uncovered:
4:24:4:'How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob! How lovely are your dwellings, O Israel!
4:24:5:Like valleys that stretch out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the Lord, like cedars beside the waters.
4:24:6:Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. Their king will be greater than Agag, and their kingdom will be exalted.
4:24:7:God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They will devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; they will pierce them through with their arrows.
4:24:8:They crouch and lie down like a lion; like a lioness, who dares to rouse them? May those who bless you be blessed, and those who curse you be cursed!"
4:24:9:Then Balak became furious with Balaam, struck his hands together, and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.
4:24:10:Now go back home! I said I would reward you richly, but the Lord has kept you from the reward."
4:24:11:Balaam replied to Balak, "Didn't I tell the messengers you sent me,
4:24:12:'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the Lord—and I must say only what the Lord says'?
4:24:13:Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in the future."
4:24:14:Then he spoke his message: "This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the vision of the man whose eyes are opened,
4:24:15:the revelation of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, though falling into a trance with his eyes uncovered:
4:24:16:I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the people of Sheth.
4:24:17:Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.
4:24:18:A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city."
4:24:19:Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: "Amalek was first among the nations, but their end will be utter destruction."
4:24:20:He saw the Kenites and spoke his message: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;
4:24:21:yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive."
4:24:22:He spoke his message: "Alas! Who can live when God does this?
4:24:23:Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin."
4:24:24:Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
4:25:1:While Israel was staying in Shittim, the people began to engage in immoral acts with Moabite women.
4:25:2:These women invited the Israelites to participate in their pagan rituals and sacrifices to their gods. The Israelites ate with them and worshiped the Moabite gods.
4:25:3:As a result, Israel became attached to the god of Moab, Baal-peor, which caused the Lord's anger to flare up against them.
4:25:4:The Lord said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them publicly before the Lord, so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel."
4:25:5:Moses ordered Israel's judges, "Each of you must kill those of your men who have joined themselves to Baal-peor."
4:25:6:One of the Israelites brought a Midianite woman into the camp, right in front of his fellow Israelites and Moses, while they were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
4:25:7:When Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, saw this, he got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
4:25:8:and followed the Israelite man into the tent. He drove the spear through both the man and the Midianite woman, piercing them through the belly. This stopped the plague that had come upon the Israelites.
4:25:9:Nevertheless, 24,000 people died because of the plague.
4:25:10:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:25:11:"Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the Israelites. Because he was as zealous for My honor among them as I am, I did not consume the Israelites in My jealousy.
4:25:12:So tell him that I am granting him My covenant of peace,
4:25:13:which will be for him and his descendants after him as a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites."
4:25:14:The name of the slain Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri, son of Salu, a leader of a Simeonite family.
4:25:15:The Midianite woman's name was Cozbi, daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
4:25:16:The Lord said to Moses,
4:25:17:"Treat the Midianites as enemies and strike them down,
4:25:18:for they have been enemies to you by their deceitful actions. They deceived you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of Peor."
4:26:1:The Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar, Aaron's son, the priest, saying,
4:26:2:"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their families—all those twenty years old or older who are able to serve in the army of Israel."
4:26:3:Moses and Eleazar the priest addressed the people on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho.
4:26:4:The census included those who were twenty years old or older, as the Lord had commanded Moses. These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt:
4:26:5:Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The descendants of Reuben were the Hanochite clan from Hanoch, the Palluite clan from Pallu,
4:26:6:The Hezronite clan from Hezron, and the Carmite clan from Carmi.
4:26:7:These were the clans of Reuben; 43,730 men were counted.
4:26:8:Pallu's descendant was Eliab.
4:26:9:Eliab's sons were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram were the community leaders who rebelled against Moses and Aaron, joining Korah's rebellion against the Lord.
4:26:10:The earth opened up and swallowed them along with Korah. They died when the fire consumed 250 men, serving as a warning sign.
4:26:11:However, Korah's sons did not die.
4:26:12:The descendants of Simeon by their clans were the Nemuelite clan from Nemuel, the Jaminite clan from Jamin, the Jakinite clan from Jakin,
4:26:13:The Zerahite clan from Zerah, and the Shaulite clan from Shaul.

4:26:24:The Jashubite clan from Jashub, and the Shimronite clan from Shimron.
4:26:25:These were the clans of Issachar; 64,300 men were counted.
4:26:26:The descendants of Zebulun by their clans were the Seredite clan from Sered, the Elonite clan from Elon, and the Jahleelite clan from Jahleel.
4:26:27:These were the clans of Zebulun; 60,500 men were counted.
4:26:28:The descendants of Joseph by their clans through Manasseh and Ephraim were:
4:26:29:The descendants of Manasseh were the Machirite clan from Machir, and the Gileadite clan from Gilead.
4:26:30:Gilead's descendants were the Iezerite clan from Iezer, the Helekite clan from Helek,
4:26:31:The Asrielite clan from Asriel, the Shechemite clan from Shechem,
4:26:32:The Shemidaite clan from Shemida, and the Hepherite clan from Hepher.
4:26:33:Hepher's son Zelophehad had no sons, but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4:26:34:These were the clans of Manasseh; 52,700 men were counted.
4:26:35:The descendants of Ephraim by their clans were the Shuthelahite clan from Shuthelah, the Becherite clan from Becher, and the Tahanite clan from Tahan.
4:26:36:The descendants of Shuthelah were the Eranite clan from Eran.
4:26:37:These were the clans of Ephraim; 32,500 men were counted.
4:26:38:The descendants of Benjamin by their clans were the Belaite clan from Bela, the Ashbelite clan from Ashbel, the Ahiramite clan from Ahiram,
4:26:39:The Shuphamite clan from Shupham, and the Huphamite clan from Hupham.
4:26:40:The descendants of Bela were the Ardite clan from Ard and the Naamite clan from Naaman.
4:26:41:These were the clans of Benjamin; 45,600 men were counted.
4:26:42:The descendants of Dan by their clans were the Shuhamite clan from Shuham.

4:26:46:These were the clans of Asher; 53,400 men were counted.
4:26:47:The descendants of Naphtali by their clans were the Jahzeelite clan from Jahzeel, the Gunite clan from Guni,
4:26:48:The Jezerite clan from Jezer, and the Shillemite clan from Shillem.
4:26:49:These were the clans of Naphtali; 45,400 men were counted.
4:26:50:The total number of Israelite men counted was 601,730.
4:26:51:The Lord instructed Moses to divide the land among the Israelites as their inheritance, based on the size of each tribe's population.
4:26:52:Larger tribes would receive more land, while smaller tribes would receive less. Each tribe's inheritance would be determined by casting lots.
4:26:53:The census included the Levites who were one month old or older; 23,000 men were counted. They were not included in the census of the other Israelites because they were not given an inheritance among them.
4:26:54:These were the people counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they conducted the census of the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho.
4:26:55:Not one of the people counted by Moses and Aaron the priest in the previous census of the Israelites in the Sinai Desert was included in this new census,
4:26:56:For the Lord had said that they would all die in the wilderness. The only exceptions were Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4:27:1:One day, the daughters of Zelophehad approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the entire community at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. These daughters were from the family of Manasseh, son of Joseph, and belonged to the clans of Gilead, son of Machir.
4:27:2:They said, "Our father died in the wilderness, but he wasn't part of Korah's rebellion against the Lord. He died because of his own sin, and he left no sons behind.
4:27:3:Why should our father's name disappear from his clan just because he had no sons? Give us property among our father's relatives."
4:27:4:Moses brought their case before the Lord.
4:27:5:The Lord replied to Moses, saying,
4:27:6:"The daughters of Zelophehad are right. You must give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives, and transfer their father's inheritance to them.
4:27:7:Tell the Israelites that if a man dies without a son, you must transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
4:27:8:If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
4:27:9:If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
4:27:10:If his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, so that they may possess it. This will be a legal requirement for the Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses."
4:27:11:Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go up this mountain in the Abarim range and see the land I have given the Israelites.
4:27:12:After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
4:27:13:for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes." (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)
4:27:14:Moses said to the Lord,
4:27:15:"May the Lord, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community
4:27:16:to lead them and bring them in, so that the Lord's people will not be like sheep without a shepherd."
4:27:17:The Lord replied to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership, and lay your hand on him.
4:27:18:Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly, and commission him in their presence.
4:27:19:Give him some of your authority so the entire Israelite community will obey him.
4:27:20:He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the Lord. At his command, he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command, they will come in."
4:27:21:Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.
4:27:22:Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the Lord instructed through Moses.
4:28:1:The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:28:2:"Give these instructions to the Israelites: You must present my offerings, food for my fire, a pleasing aroma to me, at their appointed times.
4:28:3:These are the daily burnt offerings you shall make: two unblemished year-old lambs as a regular burnt offering each day.
4:28:4:Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight,
4:28:5:along with one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed olive oil as a grain offering.
4:28:6:This is the regular burnt offering initiated at Mount Sinai, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
4:28:7:For the accompanying drink offering, pour out one-fourth of a hin of fermented drink for each lamb. In the sanctuary, present this as a drink offering poured out to the Lord.
4:28:8:Offer the second lamb at twilight, following the same procedure as for the morning offering, with its corresponding grain and drink offerings. This will be a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
4:28:9:On the Sabbath day, offer two unblemished year-old lambs, along with two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and the appropriate drink offering.
4:28:10:This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular daily burnt offering and its drink offering.
4:28:11:At the beginning of each month, present a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven year-old lambs, all without blemish.
4:28:12:With each bull, offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
4:28:13:and with each lamb, one-tenth. All these are burnt offerings, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
4:28:14:For each bull, there must be a drink offering of half a hin of wine; for the ram, one-third of a hin; and for each lamb, one-fourth of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon throughout the year.
4:28:15:In addition to the regular daily burnt offering and its drink offering, you shall offer one male goat without blemish as a sin offering to the Lord at each new moon.
4:28:16:The Passover of the Lord falls on the fourteenth day of the first month.
4:28:17:On the fifteenth day, there shall be a feast. For seven days, unleavened bread must be eaten.
4:28:18:On the first day, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
4:28:19:Present a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven year-old lambs, all without blemish.
4:28:20:With each bull, offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
4:28:21:and with each lamb, one-tenth.
4:28:22:Also, offer one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for yourselves.
4:28:23:Offer these in addition to the morning burnt offering.
4:28:24:Follow this procedure each day for seven days, presenting food offerings to the Lord, in addition to the regular burnt offerings and their accompanying grain and drink offerings.
4:28:25:On the seventh day, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
4:28:26:At the Feast of Weeks, when you present a new grain offering to the Lord, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
4:28:27:Offer a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven year-old lambs.
4:28:28:With each bull, offer a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram, two-tenths;
4:28:29:and with each lamb, one-tenth.
4:28:30:Also, offer one male goat to make atonement for yourselves.
4:28:31:Present these offerings along with their drink offerings, in addition to the regular burnt offerings and their accompanying grain offerings. All animals must be without blemish.
4:29:1:On the first day of the seventh month, you are to hold a sacred gathering. You must not do any regular work, but instead, celebrate a day of blowing trumpets.
4:29:2:Offer a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all without blemish.
4:29:3:Their grain offering shall be fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
4:29:4:and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
4:29:5:Also, offer one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for yourselves.
4:29:6:This is in addition to the monthly burnt offering, its accompanying grain offering, the daily burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to their respective regulations, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
4:29:7:On the tenth day of this seventh month, hold a sacred assembly; you must deny yourselves and not do any work.
4:29:8:Present to the Lord a burnt offering of pleasing aroma: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all without blemish.
4:29:9:Their grain offering shall be fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
4:29:10:and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
4:29:11:Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the sin offering for atonement, the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
4:29:12:On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work; celebrate a seven-day festival to the Lord.
4:29:13:Offer thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without blemish, as a burnt offering to the Lord, with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
4:29:14:The grain offering for each bull shall be three-tenths of an ephah, for each ram two-tenths,
4:29:15:and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs.
4:29:16:Also, offer one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering, its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
4:29:17:On the second day, present twelve young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs a year old, all without blemish,
4:29:18:with the appropriate grain offerings and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, according to their number, as prescribed.
4:29:19:Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.

4:29:38:and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
4:29:39:Include one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
4:29:40:These offerings are in addition to your vow and freewill offerings, whether they are burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, or fellowship offerings that you present to the Lord during your festivals.
4:30:1:Moses spoke to the leaders of Israel's tribes, saying, "This is what the Lord has commanded:
4:30:2:When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he must not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
4:30:3:If a woman, while still living in her father's house, makes a vow to the Lord or binds herself by a pledge,
4:30:4:and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing, then all her vows and pledges will stand.
4:30:5:But if her father disallows her on the day he hears about it, none of her vows or pledges will stand; the Lord will forgive her because her father has forbidden her.
4:30:6:If she marries while under a vow or a rash promise affecting herself,
4:30:7:and her husband hears about it but remains silent on the day he hears, her vows or pledges will stand.
4:30:8:However, if her husband disallows her on the day he hears, he nullifies the vow or pledge binding her, and the Lord will forgive her.
4:30:9:In the case of a widow or divorced woman, any vow or pledge she makes will be binding upon her.
4:30:10:If a married woman makes a vow or takes a pledge with an oath,
4:30:11:and her husband hears about it but says nothing on the day he hears, her vows and pledges will stand.
4:30:12:But if her husband nullifies them on the day he hears, nothing that came from her lips regarding her vows or pledges will stand; her husband has nullified them, and the Lord will forgive her.
4:30:13:Any vow or pledge that a woman makes to afflict herself, her husband may confirm it or nullify it.
4:30:14:If her husband remains silent and says nothing from day to day, he confirms all her vows and pledges; he has confirmed them because he said nothing when he heard about them.
4:30:15:But if he nullifies them after hearing about them, he shall bear her guilt."
4:30:16:These are the statutes that the Lord commanded Moses concerning a man and his wife, and a father and his daughter while she is still young and living in her father's house.
4:31:1:The LORD spoke to Moses,
4:31:2:"Carry out vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people."
4:31:3:Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your men for war, so they may go against Midian and execute the LORD's vengeance on them.
4:31:4:Send one thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel to battle."
4:31:5:From the tribes of Israel, twelve thousand armed men were provided,
4:31:6:Moses sent them to war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
4:31:7:They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man.
4:31:8:Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
4:31:9:The Israelites captured Midianite women and children and took all their cattle, flocks, and goods as plunder.
4:31:10:They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as their camps.
4:31:11:They gathered all the plunder and captives, both people and animals,
4:31:12:and brought them to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
4:31:13:Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
4:31:14:Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.
4:31:15:"Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them.
4:31:16:"These very women were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the LORD in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the LORD's people.
4:31:17:Now, kill all the boys and every woman who has slept with a man,
4:31:18:but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
4:31:19:"All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days, purify yourselves and your captives.
4:31:20:Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair, or wood."
4:31:21:Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is what is required by the law that the LORD gave Moses:
4:31:22:Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead,
4:31:23:and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.
4:31:24:On the seventh day, wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp."
4:31:25:The LORD said to Moses,
4:31:26:"You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
4:31:27:Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
4:31:28:From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or goats.
4:31:29:Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part.
4:31:30:From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or goats. Take them from their half share and give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle."
4:31:31:So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:32:The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,
4:31:33:72,000 cattle,
4:31:34:61,000 donkeys,
4:31:35:and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.
4:31:36:The half share of those who fought in the battle was 337,500 sheep,
4:31:37:36,000 cattle,
4:31:38:30,500 donkeys,
4:31:39:and 16,000 people.
4:31:40:From the soldiers' half, Moses took one out of every five hundred as tribute for the LORD. The total was 675 sheep,
4:31:41:72 cattle,
4:31:42:61 donkeys,
4:31:43:and 32 people.
4:31:44:Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:45:The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses separated from that of the fighting men,
4:31:46:amounted to 337,500 sheep,
4:31:47:36,000 cattle,
4:31:48:30,500 donkeys,
4:31:49:and 16,000 people.
4:31:50:From the Israelites' half, Moses took one out of every fifty, selected from the people and animals, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle, as the LORD commanded Moses.
4:31:51:The officers who were over the units of the army—commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses
4:31:52:and said, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.
4:31:53:So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
4:31:54:Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted articles.
4:31:55:All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels.
4:31:56:Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
4:31:57:Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
4:32:1:The tribes of Reuben and Gad had many livestock, so they approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community, saying,
4:32:2:"The lands of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
4:32:3:these regions are suitable for raising livestock, and we have a lot of animals.
4:32:4:If it pleases you, let us settle here instead of crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land."
4:32:5:Moses replied to them, "So your fellow Israelites should go to war while you stay here?
4:32:6:Why would you discourage them from entering the land that the Lord has given them?
4:32:7:This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land.
4:32:8:They discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the Lord had given them, and the Lord became angry.
4:32:9:So He swore that none of them would see the Promised Land except Caleb and Joshua.
4:32:10:Now the Lord's anger has subsided, and He has brought this generation here to inherit the land.
4:32:11:But if you turn away now, you will bring His anger upon all of Israel.
4:32:12:Your actions will cause this people to perish in the wilderness, just as your fathers did."
4:32:13:Gad and Reuben replied, "We will build pens for our livestock and cities for our families here.
4:32:14:Then we will join our fellow Israelites in battle until everyone has received their inheritance.
4:32:15:Our families and livestock will remain here, but we will fight for our people.
4:32:16:We won't return to our lands until the Israelites have taken possession of their inheritance."
4:32:17:Moses agreed, saying, "If you do this, and if you arm yourselves for battle,
4:32:18:and if you cross the Jordan to fight until the Lord drives out His enemies,
4:32:19:then when the land is secure, you may return to your possessions on this side of the Jordan.
4:32:20:But if you don't follow through, you will be sinning against the Lord, and be sure that your sin will find you out.
4:32:21:Build cities for your families and pens for your livestock, then fulfill your promise."
4:32:22:Gad and Reuben promised Moses, "We will do as you command.
4:32:23:Our children and livestock will stay here, while we go to war in Canaan.
4:32:24:We will not return until every Israelite has received their inheritance."
4:32:25:So Moses gave the Gadites, Reubenites, and half the tribe of Manasseh the land of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan.
4:32:26:The Gadites built the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
4:32:27:Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
4:32:28:Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities with pens for their livestock.
4:32:29:The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
4:32:30:Nebo, Baal-meon (with altered names), and Sibmah. They renamed the cities they rebuilt.
4:32:31:The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites living there.
4:32:32:Moses gave Gilead to the Machirites, descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
4:32:33:Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair.
4:32:34:Nobah captured Kenath with its surrounding villages and renamed it Nobah after himself.
4:33:1:These are the journeys of the Israelites as they left Egypt, led by Moses and Aaron.
4:33:2:Under God's command, Moses recorded the starting points of their travels stage by stage.
4:33:3:The Israelites departed from Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They went out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,
4:33:4:who were burying their firstborn. The Lord had executed judgment on their gods.
4:33:5:The Israelites set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
4:33:6:They left Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
4:33:7:From Etham, they turned back to Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol.
4:33:8:They left Pi Hahiroth, crossed the Red Sea into the wilderness, and traveled for three days in the Wilderness of Etham before camping at Marah.
4:33:9:From Marah, they went to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
4:33:10:Leaving Elim, they camped by the Red Sea.
4:33:11:Next, they camped in the Wilderness of Sin.
4:33:12:From there, they moved to Dophkah and camped.
4:33:13:They journeyed from Dophkah to Alush and set up camp.
4:33:14:Afterward, they left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
4:33:15:Departing from Rephidim, they camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
4:33:16:They left the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
4:33:17:From Kibroth Hattaavah, they traveled to Hazeroth and camped there.
4:33:18:Leaving Hazeroth, they camped at Rithmah.
4:33:19:They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez.
4:33:20:From Rimmon Perez, they moved to Libnah and camped.
4:33:21:They journeyed from Libnah to Rissah and set up camp.
4:33:22:Next, they camped at Kehelathah.
4:33:23:From Kehelathah, they went to Mount Shepher and camped.
4:33:24:Leaving Mount Shepher, they camped at Haradah.
4:33:25:They moved from Haradah to Makheloth and camped.
4:33:26:From Makheloth, they traveled to Tahath and set up camp.
4:33:27:Afterward, they left Tahath and camped at Terah.
4:33:28:They journeyed from Terah to Mithkah and camped.
4:33:29:From Mithkah, they went to Hashmonah and camped.
4:33:30:Leaving Hashmonah, they camped at Moseroth.
4:33:31:They set out from Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan.
4:33:32:From Bene Jaakan, they moved to Hor Haggidgad and camped.
4:33:33:Next, they camped at Jotbathah.
4:33:34:From Jotbathah, they traveled to Abronah and camped.
4:33:35:Leaving Abronah, they camped at Ezion Geber.
4:33:36:They journeyed from Ezion Geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
4:33:37:From Kadesh, they moved to Mount Hor, on the border of Edom.
4:33:38:Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor at God's command and died there. This happened in the fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
4:33:39:Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
4:33:40:The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.
4:33:41:They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
4:33:42:From Zalmonah, they journeyed to Punon and camped.
4:33:43:Leaving Punon, they camped at Oboth.
4:33:44:They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, on the border of Moab.
4:33:45:From Iye Abarim, they moved to Dibon Gad and camped.
4:33:46:Next, they camped at Almon Diblathaim.
4:33:47:From Almon Diblathaim, they traveled to the mountains of Abarim, near Nebo, and camped.
4:33:48:They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
4:33:49:They camped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
4:33:50:On the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, across from Jericho, the Lord spoke to Moses and said,
4:33:51:"Tell the Israelites that when they cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
4:33:52:they must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before them. Destroy their carved images, cast idols, and high places.
4:33:53:Take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given it to you as your inheritance.
4:33:54:You must divide the land among yourselves by lot, according to your families. To a larger group, give a larger inheritance; to a smaller group, give a smaller one. Wherever the lot falls, that place will be theirs. You will inherit the land according to your ancestral tribes.
4:33:55:But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those who remain will become like thorns in your eyes and stings in your sides. They will cause trouble for you in the land where you live.
4:33:56:And what I had planned to do to them, I will do to you."
4:34:1:Now, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
4:34:2:"Give these instructions to the Israelites about the land they will inherit in Canaan; this is the territory that will be assigned to them.
4:34:3:Their southern border will start from the Wilderness of Zin along the Edomite border, and extend eastward to the end of the Salt Sea.
4:34:4:It will continue southward past Scorpion Pass, toward Zin, and end at Kadesh Barnea. From there, it will go on to Hazar Addar and pass through Azmon.
4:34:5:From Azmon, the border will turn toward the Brook of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea.
4:34:6:On the western side, the Mediterranean Sea will be their border.
4:34:7:To the north, the border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea, run to Mount Hor,
4:34:8:continue to Lebo Hamath, and then extend to Zedad.
4:34:9:Next, the border will reach Ziphron and conclude at Hazar Enan. This will be their northern boundary.
4:34:10:For the eastern border, you will draw a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
4:34:11:From Shepham, the border will descend to Riblah, east of Ain, and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee.
4:34:12:Then, the border will follow the Jordan River and end at the Dead Sea. These will be the boundaries of your land."
4:34:13:Moses also told the Israelites, "This is the land you are to divide by lot among yourselves, as the Lord has commanded.
4:34:14:The nine-and-a-half tribes will receive their inheritance, 
4:34:15:because the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance east of the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them."
4:34:16:The Lord instructed Moses to appoint leaders from each tribe to help divide the land.
4:34:17:These are the names of the men: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun,
4:34:18:and one leader from each tribe: Shemuel from the tribe of Reuben, Elidad from the tribe of Simeon,
4:34:19:Bukki from the tribe of Benjamin, Hanniel from the tribe of Ephraim,
4:34:20:Kemuel from the tribe of Manasseh, Elizaphan from the tribe of Zebulun,
4:34:21:Paltiel from the tribe of Issachar, Ahihud from the tribe of Asher,
4:34:22:and Pedahel from the tribe of Naphtali.
4:34:23:These are the men the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance among the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
4:35:1:In the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
4:35:2:"Command the Israelites to give cities from their inheritance to the Levites, along with the surrounding pasturelands.
4:35:3:The Levites will live in these cities and have space for their cattle, flocks, and all their other possessions.
4:35:4:The pasturelands around the cities you give them should extend 500 yards from the city wall in each direction.
4:35:5:Measure 1,000 yards outside the city on the east, south, west, and north sides, with the city at the center. This area will serve as their pasturelands for the cities.
4:35:6:Among the cities you give the Levites, designate six as cities of refuge, where anyone who unintentionally kills another person can flee for safety.
4:35:7:Of the total forty-eight cities you give to the Levites, six will be cities of refuge.
4:35:8:From the larger tribes, take more cities; from the smaller tribes, fewer cities. Each tribe should provide a portion of their land for the Levites based on their inheritance."
4:35:9:The Lord told Moses:
4:35:10:"Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,
4:35:11:choose cities to be your cities of refuge, where a person who accidentally kills someone can flee.
4:35:12:These cities will protect the killer from the avenger of blood, so that they are not killed before standing trial before the community.
4:35:13:Designate six cities of refuge for this purpose.
4:35:14:Three cities will be on the east side of the Jordan, and three in the land of Canaan.
4:35:15:These cities of refuge will serve both the Israelites and any foreigners living among them, providing a safe place for anyone who unintentionally kills another person.
4:35:16:If someone strikes another with an iron object, causing death, they are a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:17:If someone kills another by striking them with a stone that could cause death, they are a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:18:If someone kills another by striking them with a wooden object that could cause death, they are a murderer and must be put to death.
4:35:19:The avenger of blood has the right to kill the murderer when they encounter them.
4:35:20:If someone pushes another out of hatred or intentionally throws something at them and causes their death,
4:35:21:or if they strike another with their hand in enmity and the person dies, the one who struck the fatal blow is a murderer and must be put to death. The avenger of blood can kill the murderer upon meeting them.
4:35:22:But if someone accidentally pushes another without hostility or unintentionally throws an object at them,
4:35:23:or drops a stone on them without knowing it could kill them, and they die, the community must judge the case according to these regulations.
4:35:24:The community must protect the one who killed another unintentionally from the avenger of blood and return them to the city of refuge where they had fled. They must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with holy oil.
4:35:25:If the unintentional killer leaves the city of refuge before the high priest's death,
4:35:26:and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city, the avenger has the right to kill the killer without being guilty of murder.
4:35:27:The unintentional killer must remain in the city of refuge until the high priest's death; only then can they return to their own property.
4:35:28:These regulations will be a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants wherever you live.
4:35:29:Anyone who kills another person must be put to death on the testimony of witnesses. No one may be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
4:35:30:Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die; they must be put to death.
4:35:31:Also, do not accept a ransom for someone who has fled to a city of refuge, allowing them to return to their land before the death of the high priest.
4:35:32:You must not pollute the land where you live, for bloodshed pollutes the land. No atonement can be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
4:35:33:Do not defile the land where you live and in which I dwell, for I, the Lord, dwell among the Israelites."
4:36:1:The family leaders of the Gilead clan, descendants of Machir (son of Manasseh and grandson of Joseph), approached Moses and the other leaders.
4:36:2:They said, "Sir, the Lord instructed you to divide the land by lot among the Israelites. You were also told by the Lord to give our brother Zelophehad's inheritance to his daughters.
4:36:3:Now, if they marry men from another tribe, their inheritance will be taken away from our ancestral tribe and added to the tribe into which they marry. As a result, our allotted portion will be reduced.
4:36:4:Moreover, when the Jubilee Year comes for the Israelites, their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry, and it will be taken away from our ancestral inheritance."
4:36:5:Moses, following the Lord's command, told the Israelites, "The tribe of Joseph's descendants are right in what they say.
4:36:6:This is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please, as long as they marry within their father's tribal clan.
4:36:7:No inheritance in Israel shall be transferred from one tribe to another, for each of the Israelites must keep the inherited land of their ancestors.
4:36:8:Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone from her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite can possess the inheritance of their ancestors.
4:36:9:No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another; each Israelite tribe must keep its own allotted inheritance."
4:36:10:The daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord commanded Moses.
4:36:11:Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married their cousins on their father's side.
4:36:12:They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's tribe and clan.
4:36:13:These are the commands and regulations that the Lord gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
