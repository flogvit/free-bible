34:1:1:The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.
34:1:2:God is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.
34:1:3:He rebukes the sea, making it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
34:1:4:The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.
34:1:5:Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are shattered by him.
34:1:6:The LORD is good, a stronghold in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,
34:1:7:But he will sweep away with an overwhelming flood; he will pursue his enemies into darkness.
34:1:8:Whatever they plot against the LORD, he will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.
34:1:9:For they will be entangled like thorns, and drunk like drunkards; they will be completely burned, like dry stubble.
34:1:10:From you, Nineveh, comes one who plots evil against the LORD, a wicked counselor.
34:1:11:This is what the LORD says: "Although they are strong and numerous, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
34:1:12:Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear away your shackles."
34:1:13:The LORD has given this command concerning you, Nineveh: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the idols and images in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."
34:1:14:Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.
34:2:1:Look, a messenger is coming down the mountain road, bringing news of an advancing army. They are attacking with great force and speed.
34:2:2:The attacker comes with shields and soldiers dressed in red; their chariots gleam like fire, and their horsemen charge swiftly.
34:2:3:In the heat of battle, the soldiers brandish their spears; the chariots race furiously through the streets, crashing into each other in the chaos.
34:2:4:They look like torches, running like lightning, as they storm through the city.
34:2:5:The invaders summon their strength; they stumble in their haste to scale the walls, while the defenders set up their defenses.
34:2:6:The river gates are thrown open, and the palace collapses under the pressure.
34:2:7:It is decreed that the city will be taken captive, her slave women moaning like doves and beating their breasts in sorrow.
34:2:8:Nineveh has been a pool of water since its beginning, but now its people flee. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back.
34:2:9:Loot the silver! Plunder the gold! There is no end to Nineveh's treasures, a wealth of every kind of precious thing.
34:2:10:Desolation, devastation, and destruction! Hearts melt in fear, knees tremble, every stomach churns, and all faces grow pale.
34:2:11:Where is the lion's den, the place where the young lions fed, where the lion and lioness went without fear, and their cubs roamed freely?
34:2:12:The lion tore apart enough prey for his cubs, strangled food for his mate, and filled his lair with the kill and his den with the spoils.
34:2:13:Behold, I am against you, declares the Lord of hosts. I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will put an end to your plundering on earth, and the voice of your messengers will be heard no more.
34:3:1:Woe to the bloody city, full of lies and robbery! Prey never departs from it.
34:3:2:Listen to the cracking whip, the rumbling wheel, galloping horses, and jolting chariots!
34:3:3:Horsemen charge, swords flash, spears glitter! There's a multitude of slain, heaps of corpses, endless dead bodies—they stumble over their fallen.
34:3:4:All this is because of the countless acts of prostitution by the seductive harlot, who has mastered her craft in enchantments, capturing nations with her beauty and families with her sorcery.
34:3:5:Behold, I am against you, declares the Lord of Hosts; I will lift your skirts over your face, and show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your disgrace.
34:3:6:I will throw filth upon you and treat you with contempt; I will make you a spectacle.
34:3:7:All who see you will flee from you and say, "Nineveh is devastated! Who will mourn for her?" Where can I find comforters for you?
34:3:8:Are you better than Thebes, that was situated by the Nile, with water surrounding her? Her rampart was the sea, and her wall was made from the waters.
34:3:9:Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.
34:3:10:Yet she became an exile, going into captivity; her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner. Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.
34:3:11:You too will become drunk; you will be hidden. You too will seek refuge from the enemy.
34:3:12:All your fortresses are like fig trees with ripe figs—when shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
34:3:13:Behold, your troops in your midst are like women; the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has devoured your bars.
34:3:14:Draw water for the siege; strengthen your defenses! Go into the clay and tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!
34:3:15:There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down. It will devour you like locusts. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!
34:3:16:You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locusts spread out and fly away.
34:3:17:Your princes are like locusts, and your officials like swarms of grasshoppers that camp in the hedges on a cold day—but when the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where they have gone.
34:3:18:Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains, with none to gather them.
34:3:19:There is no healing for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you, for upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually?
